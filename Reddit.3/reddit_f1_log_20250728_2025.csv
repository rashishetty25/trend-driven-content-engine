1mbaarm,Tyres continues to destroy the possibility of good races.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mbaarm/tyres_continues_to_destroy_the_possibility_of/,2025-07-28, Discussion,"I have posted previously that I find it incredibly frustrating that the (S) tyre is basically a qualifying tyre now and almost never gets any use in races.


But once again the race yesterday saw basically no variance in tyre strategy 


Most cars put the (M) tyre on around lap 13. 


By lap 20 
- Piastri 1:46:7
- max 1:46:8
- Leclerc 1:47:1 
- Russell 1:47:4


On lap 43 
- Piastri 1:45:7
- max 1:46:5
- Leclerc 1:46:5
- Russell 1:56:6


Now obviously the cars are carrying much less fuel at this stage, but how is the medium still performing this well after 30+ laps! 


There is no point in risking a tyre change when the delta doesn’t exist and overtaking is difficult 


","[""I actually thought Lando putting on the hards was a masterstroke because I didn't expect a medium to last 3 quarters of a race"", ""big factor is the low track and air temp that put way less stress on the tyres.\n\nProbably, in a 100% dry race with 25-26°C air temp and 40+°C track temp, Medium tyres wouldn't last 30+ laps."", 'Yeah, the mediums lasted longer than expected, I think the cold weather helped.', 'Pirelli skipping a compound theoretically meant that the Hard should have been too slow, and so would push everyone to a 2-stop race on the significantly faster Mediums paired with either a Soft or Hard. There should have been variety in strategy. \n\nThe problem was the wet start and shortened race (not just that we went racing on Lap 4, but that the slick tyre race started on Lap 11-13).\n\nThis resulted in a 32 lap dry race, which made the two-stop too slow and so all strategy pointed to managing the Medium to the end. That’s what ruined it. \n\nIn essence a super slow paced Medium was faster than a pushed Hard which was faster than a pushed Medium-Medium.', 'cold weather helped pilots keep those tyres usable last so long, only cars with excessive load were chewing through them.', 'The issue is more complex.\n\n\nPirelli has to provide three compounds but they need to cover a ton of scenarios based on the weather and in general during the year you have such different conditions in terms of temp, heat, surface that they just cannot have that many specific tires and they need to guarantee safety across all of these possible conditions.\xa0\n\n\nIf the tires are too different in performance then you force the same strategy ultimately.\xa0\n\n\nThe bigger issue at play here is that tires have become the only strategic tool and this makes races way more predictable. Refueling added so much dynamics to races as you could undercut heavily since less fuel also meant shorter pit stops.\n\n\nNow the difference between the slowest pit and the fastest is what, 1s? This makes it just so hard to use pits and number of stops as a viable strategy', ""Tyre management. Piastri drove exactly as fast as he needed to to stay out of range of Norris, and exactly as slow as he needed to to make the tyre last to the end. His 1:45.7s on lap 43 (so, low fuel) is a full five seconds slower than his fresh tyre SQ1 run.\n\nArguably the only one of the front runners who would going be flat out on slicks would have been Norris since he (we assume) didn't need to worry about making it to the end on his C1s.\n\nEdit: added low fuel to L43"", 'Track resurfacing also had an impact. Similar to Suzuka', ""The amount of races I've seen where the driver in second is several seconds behind but on a better tyre and just completely fails to catch up is unbelievable.

Team is operating on a really strong level with much less mistakes than last year. They’re handling inter team battle really well (but considering other teams are realistically out of the fight it’s probably easier) Both drivers are showing great level of driving with Oscar having a slight edge in consistency over Lando. But even with slight mistakes Lando makes, he’s still keeping himself in a Fight.\n\n**Max Verstappen**\n\nProbably the only bright spot of the Team this year so far. He’s always ready to pounce and grab the win when the opportunity arrives. Really can’t ask anything more from a driver and Max this season is the only thing keeping mclaren drivers on their toes.\n\n**Williams and Albon**\n\nWilliams delivered on a huge growth this year, definitely a positive step in the right direction and mostly thanks to incredible consistency from Alex. Everyone doubted him, and put him under a lot of pressure with Carlos coming into a team but he handled himself brilliantly. You could say Carlos had a few unlucky ones this year but Alex has him beat handily so far and he showa no signs of stopping.\n\n**Pierre Gasly**\n\nI think it’s unfair to see how little recognition Pierre gets this year. He’s driving the wheels of of that Alpine and i genuinely sometimes can’t believe how he pulls it off. A team that has myriad of problems with management (or should i rather say missmanagement), morale, performance, he’s still getting regular q3 entries with some outstanding Qualy laps, and some wonderful race drives. He’s definitely one of top driver performers this year.\n\n**Sauber**\n\nFrom a team that i expected the least, and when i expected them to wait out a Year before transforming into Audi. They surprised me the most. It looks like they really consolidated their management and leadership, nailed a driver pairing and even brought upgrades to the car to be genuinely competetive with other midfielders. It’s great to see them being rewarded with a podium (And what a podium it was). Both Nico and Gabi had great races.\xa0\n\n**George Russell**\n\nThis is the year where George really visibly stepped up. Lewis leaving mercedes created a big power vacuum, and George took it upon himself to take it. He’s shown some real stellar drives this year, and barely put a foot wrong so far this year. He’s finally showing his true potential that he was being called for years. Ultimately he’s being let down by Mercedes and a car they delivered him (much like Leclerc).\n\n\n**Charles Leclerc**\n\nThere’s really not much more a team can ask from their driver. Charles is doing absolute maximum Ferrari is able to do. He’s consistent, his racecraft is wonderful, tyre management is great, Charles is having a stellar driving season so far and is being let down by the car that simpy doesn’t have the pace to be competetive for the wins. He really continued on his driving form from last season in the best possible way, and it’s a real shame he cannot crown it with wins.\n\nNeutrals\n\n** Racing bulls**\n\nI was thinking, is it really fair not to put them in the positives column, they had some stellar drives, bunch of points, and Hadjar really impressed with some great drives as a Rookie. It’s true but whole driver seat drama in RB family, really leaves bad taste. They started the season strong with both Yuki and Hadjar, then when the swap happened lawson had a lot of issues, but in the end he’s also slowly regaining confidence and driving better. Strategy wise they’re still the biggest clowns of the field and that is the only reason why i’m not rating them positively.\n\n**HAAS**\n\nHaas this year might be the definition of neutral. While they had some great drives from both drivers and the pairing seems to work really well, they are really showing no signs of some great improvement and growth. They are always in the mix to score some points but also can be nowhere near them.\n\n\n**Lewis Hamilton**\n\n\nTransition to the red team has been really painful for Lewis. I cannot say he disappointed because it would be unfair, he had few stellar drives but mostly he was average at best. The car doesn’t suit him and it’s painfully obvious. Charles has and edge on him but i think that was also expected. Overall, pacewise i don’t think he’s even that far from Charles. And i genuinely think that Carlos wouldn’t be better than Lewis this year in Ferrari even though he’d have a lot more experience with red cars. Lewis has shown sparks of his true self in some races and i hope he continues to improve in the rest of the season but ultimately Ferrari gave him an ass of a car and it’s hampering him a Lot.\n\n\n*Negatives*\n\n\n**Ferrari**\n\n\nI think it’s fair to say that ferrari is abbysmal this year. From a team that was genuinely competetive to Mclaren last season to the team that is a 5th best car on some occasions this year. A shame because they have a super interesting drivers lineup and they’ve managed to fuck them up.\n\n**Red Bull**\n\nA fall from grace of last year spiraled to an abyssmal level this year, Car is barely drivable even for Max, losing a bunch of crucial staff members, comically atrocious missmanagement of the team and 2nd car being virtually non existant. \xa0The whole Yuki/Liam situation was ridiculous, pit stop crew is also out of shape for many races this year.\n\n**Aston Martin**\n\nReally don’t know what to say about them as a team. Stroll is non existant for most of the races, Alonso is driving average this season with some good results.\n\n**Alpine**\n\nTeam missmanagement (whole doohan colapinto saga), car going nowhere pacewise even with upgrades, Gasly is the only bright spot of the team.\n\n\nI understand i haven’t mentioned some stuff and drivers, but post is already too long :)', 'Is the 16 points the largest lead the whole year?', 'best rivalries \nLeclerc v russel\nalbon vs antonelli \nrest of the field vs each other - p12 - p20 brutal', 'Just one points finish in last 7 races is ridiculous. \n\nNot that he’s at fault for them all, but he’d be sacked at Red Bull or exchanged for an VCARB driver', 'Antonelli reeks of underdevelopment.

Now that the dust has settled in Belgium, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will not be deleted since I do not have that power, but I will be very disappointed with you. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","['I haven’t seen much Liam love around despite a pretty impressive P8 finish yesterday and a P10 in the Sprint.\n\nPretty good weekend for him (close to Hadjar in quali) and after a rough start to the year both at Red Bull and VCARB it’s good to see him finally picking up the pace and putting in good performances.\n\nAlbon and Gasly have shown that you can pick yourself up after being destroyed by Max as teammates so I’d love to see the same happen with Liam.', ""Ultimately, Lando lost the race and Oscar won the race at the start. Oscar knew he needed to take his chance and he did, so credit to him. Would love to better understand the battery issue Lando had and how much of a role it played (and how much of it was in/out of his control), but not sure we'll ever know. \n\nOnce Lando was in P2, the tire offset was probably his only fighting chance. A shame they didn't/couldn't double stack, since he easily lost net time to Oscar by having to do another lap on inters and lost net time to Charles behind as well, but I also have a feeling that if they had double stacked they would've both ended up on the mediums since the call for the hard seemed to be a super last minute call from his engineer as he was coming in. The extra lap on inters + the slow stop + a much slower tire meant he was climbing a mountain just to put Oscar under pressure. I think his own mistakes cost him the chance to get into DRS range, but I'm not sure even if he had had 5-6 laps of DRS behind Oscar that he would've been able to make the pass, given what we saw in the sprint and with Max/Charles throughout the whole race.\n\nOverall, I think both Lando and Oscar can take away plenty of positives from this weekend. Oscar got the upper hand this time out but I have a feeling this battle is going all the way to the end."", 'Merc really needs to find out what they changed for the worse after canada, because they are only the 4th fastest right now.', 'Did anybody notice that Tsunoda lost 2 positions in the last 2 laps?', ""Seems I'm alone here in having actually enjoyed the race.

Maybe they should try again in Hungary."", 'Did we actually get any more information on Landos battery at the start and why he didnt have power.\n\n\nOP went flying by and thats without DRS!\n\n\nNico was trolling Zak but he wasnt wrong imo', 'I think the race could have easily started 15 minutes earlier than it did\n\nBut I\'m not too mad about that because its very hard to judge if the track is suitable if there are no F1 cars out there showing the current condition of spray and the drivers giving their feedback. So i can\'t criticize this too much\n\nBut i can criticize the 4 laps behind the safety car. They said they were going to do a minimum of 2 laps behind the safety car, Ok 1 probably would have been enough but you\'ve made the decision that it will be 2 at minimum so I understand doing 2 laps, but then they did another 2 laps behind the safety car on top of that.\n\nthat I think is worthy of criticizing.\n\nthough to add some balance i think the *""end of wet races""* doomsayers may be overreacting. They clearly are more strict and more conservative at Spa than other tracks. Its just one of the more dangerous tracks on the calendar', ""I was waiting for this one! That was a race that could've had potential, if not for the track drying up way too fast. In the end, it was sadly quite boring. \n\nLewis showed why a wet setup in the rain is worth a lot. Some great overtakes in the wet and then in the end the same setup screwed him over when it dried up and he didn't have the top speed to overtake Albon. In a similar vain, Max got stuck behind Charles as it dried up, no skinny wing, no top speed. Same with Yuki who got double screwed because the call to pit came a bit too late. It's a race of what could've been for a lot of drivers on wet setups. \n\nNorris with a rather bad restart. He went early, made a mistake into turn 1 and that sealed his fate. Piastri with a simple overtake. I don't think Norris had the pace to get past Piastri on track anyways. His mistakes later on in the race didn't help either.\n\nOn the bright side, everyone kept it on track when it was still wet. I'm still very impressed by Bortoleto. One of the best performing rookies for sure. \n\nAntonelli really is in a bit of a slump. For his sake I hope he recovers some confidence quickly. He's young, but if his performance doesn't have an upturn soon, the media is going to start the uncomfortable questions and I would hate that for him. \n\nNow my side note after the weekend. Can we just get rid of the wet tyres? It's not Pirelli's fault, but by the time the track conditions are bad enough for the full wets, visibility is too poor to race. Might as well just not bring those tyres to save on costs. No one uses them anyways. Maybe bring a third set of hard tyres instead, so teams can run them in practice if there's doubts about a two-stop race where the hard could be useful."", ""Don't let the race being boring distract you from the fact that the meejums lasted more than half the damn race lmao that's diabolical and just really isn't supposed to happen""]",34,151,0.92,34,147,147,9,15,0.040000000000000036,9

But when you neutralize the fact that he’s in a top-2 car — which can even be the best in cold conditions — the data becomes extremely disappointing. He was completely outclassed by Russell. Finishing behind him in 100% of the races statistically means Russell is simply *much better* than him, because Antonelli couldn’t even beat him once by luck or by making fewer mistakes. Looking at it objectively, it even feels unfair to see Antonelli getting all the attention just because he has a faster car and ends up near the top, while Hadjar, Bortoleto, and Bearman seem far more interesting than him.

Edit: ""rookie vs veteran"". We never had a champion that lost all their races against their rival. Usually it's very balanced and many won as rookies.

And yet you hear very little about Sainz now, struggling along to do the best he can with Williams; he's getting beat there by his own teammate this year, so there's that. Obviously it takes a little time to acclimate to a new environment; a reason that Hamilton OBVIOUSLY is given the benefit of the doubt on, despite last year's results at Mercedes.

Today Sainz's own pit crew screwed him over. And they then decided on a 2 stopper, and it simply didn't go his way today. Hamilton had one of his better races; passing a bunch of guys with his updated equipment and getting up to where he's normally at.

I do not feel that Hamilton is ever a threat to win a race. LeClerc has been consistently outperforming the world champion. It doesn't really feel competitive. Just like last year didn't feel that competitive with George Russell at Mercedes. I feel that, of the 8 seats that make up McClaren, Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull, Hamilton is at best 6th, with the jury being out as way too early on Antonelli. Only the 2nd RB seat doesn't compare to Lewis.

In hindsight, the manner in which Sainz was quickly ushered out of Ferrari seems sort of sickening at this point. He's left to one choice, no options. And he's done career wise, unless one of the big three/four invite him to a seat, and obviously Ferrari isn't in the cards for that.

This seems alot different from a driver CHOOSING to leave because he's not the number one driver and wants to go somewhere else to be the big dog, like what happened with Daniel Riccardo, who should probably never have left RedBull. He's the last great 2nd driver they've had in years.

Guys like Sainz and Botas, who was a pretty darn productive driver for Mercedes, they both got the short end. Watching Nico's 3rd place finish a few weeks ago got me really thinking about this. There are some pretty damn good drivers out there, without the equipment to show their talent, left hoping for inclement weather or a miracle for them to have a quality day.

I've always loved Alonso, and have watched his struggle for many years now. About half the time he's ""the best of the rest"". Not this year obviously. But you watch him and you see the talent after all these years, and you cannot help but wonder how he'd do in a number one seat at one of the best places. Like with Sainz.
