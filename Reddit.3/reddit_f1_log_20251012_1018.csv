It’s so hard to lose your shadow', 'As a single male close to Ham\'s age who just lost both of my dogs over the summer I really empathize with his pain. You have family, you have friends, they all come and go in your life. Sometimes there are days, weeks, where I am just grinding at work and don\'t see anyone else. The dogs were always there. They were always happy to see me. Even if they had destroyed something in the house I was quick to forgive them.\n\nTo add to the pain of losing some part of your self, your life, your routine, there is the context of euthanasia. I had to make the very painful decision to euthanize my younger dog because his cancer was progressing rapidly. Otherwise, he was a healthy dog with a lot of love for life. It absolutely took me out when the drugs reached his heart and the vet just said ""He\'s gone.""\n\nRest in peace Molly, Behr, and Roscoe', 'A lot of people on here have clearly never had a pet or loved an animal deeply. \n\nShame… it’s a wonderful feeling, which makes their deaths extraordinarily sad.', 'I know that pain he’s feeling.

I really feel for Lewis.', 'My dog is 14.5yrs, I dread the day I have to say goodbye. What a life Roscoe must’ve had though, Lewis surely did the guy proud!', 'What a great memory. \n\nHe’s likely less than three years from retiring.

Of course he’s still gonna travel a lot but he will be more in control.', ""They're not here for all of our life, but we are there for all of their life.
