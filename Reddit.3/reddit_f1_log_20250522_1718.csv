Unfortunately, in Monaco, there is only this type of corner, so I expect a complicated weekend . At the same time, the circuit is so special and unique that we can hope that there is something in the car that we have not yet discovered and that will reveal itself here.\n\nOfficial Ferrari strategy: hoping that the car will reveal itself because the circuit is unique and special. Woof.', 'Next Race', 'Translation \n\n\nOn the eve of his home race, Charles Leclerc met with the Monegasque press, drawing up a very honest assessment of his 2025. The Ferrari driver did not hide his disappointment for the poor results obtained in the first seven events of the year, in which he collected only 61 points and a podium in the Jeddah race .\n\n\n\nLeclerc: “We are not satisfied with the car”\n\n\nFerrari had closed 2024 by challenging McLaren for the Constructors\' title until the final corners of the last Grand Prix of the year. The great design revolution involving the SF-25 should have allowed it to take that further step forward that the 2024 single-seater, now at the maximum of its development, would not have been able to guarantee.\n\n\nSo, at least for now, it has not been and from this point Leclerc\'s judgment on the current season starts: "" Clearly, it is negative . We are not at all satisfied with the performance of the car. Last year we ended the season fighting for the Constructors\' World Championship. So we had a lot of ambition to try to win the title this year . We are fully committed to trying to recover the performance lost compared to McLaren and Red Bull in particular .""\n\n\nThe winter objective now seems compromised, considering the big gap in the general classification accumulated in these first months. On the horizon, however, is the Spanish GP, an event that could bring a small revolution in the values on the track: “ It is simply impossible for me to say that a good season would mean finishing fourth, third, etc. Honestly, I will believe it until the end ,” said Leclerc. “ Last year, we had an ultra-dominant Red Bull in the first seven races, and then a McLaren that recovered strongly. I hope we can have this kind of turnaround starting from Barcelona. In Spain, there will be a change to the technical regulation for the wings , which we have worked a lot on. It should be an advantage for us , but it remains uncertain. So we must win all the points possible until Barcelona .”\n\n\nMonte Carlo: an encore is difficult, but…\n\n\nWhile waiting for the possible breakthrough in Barcelona, there is the most expensive race for Leclerc to face. The Ferrari driver finally broke his personal curse last year, obtaining his first success on the streets of Monte Carlo.\n\n\nA repeat this year seems very difficult, even if Leclerc leaves a small hope open: “ I am only aiming for the win. The podium is not something I particularly dream of. For several Grands Prix, our weak points have been the slow corners . Unfortunately, in Monaco, there is only this type of corner, so I expect a complicated weekend . At the same time, the circuit is so special and unique that we can hope that there is something in the car that we have not yet discovered and that will reveal itself here .”\n\n\nHamilton\'s Arrival: A Learning Opportunity\n\n\nThe big theme of the winter was the arrival in Maranello of Lewis Hamilton. The relationship with the seven-time world champion is very good and Leclerc remains convinced that the hiring of a driver with the experience of the British driver has been positive for him too: “ For me, nothing changes. It\'s a huge learning opportunity for me, because he\'s one of the legends of F1. But it\'s also a great motivation and an opportunity to show what I can do with Lewis at my side in the same car .”\n\n\nInteresting is what Leclerc said about Hamilton’s characteristics from which he has learned the most so far: “ The discipline and his work ethic. Carlos (Sainz) was also a hard worker, but Lewis is a hard worker in a different way , and it’s really interesting to see the dynamics within the team. How does he handle problems? How does he comment on the car during development? It’s always interesting for every driver to be able to analyse how their teammate collaborates with their engineers .”\n\n\nAmong the positive aspects of working with Hamilton, Leclerc also mentioned the driving style: “ He is extremely talented, he has a very interesting driving style, which I can use myself in certain moments of the race , when it is the right time. We drive quite similarly. We both push on the corner entry. I think it is also quite positive for the team, because we have a clear and precise direction, towards which we are both aiming .”', 'The car is slow now but from Barcelona it will become undrivable\xa0', 'We\'ve gone from ""next year"" to ""next race""', 'Obligatory ""don\'t give me hope""', 'A few weeks ago it was from imola', '…nothing will change” Unless they pull a McLaren and the season suddenly shifts to an even crazier outcome, with McLaren vs. Max vs. Ferrari', '(insert hopium here)']",631,85,0.98,631,82,82,22,1,0.0,22

ALO gained some speed on VER between Massenet and Casino (T4), but the most significant gain was inbetween Casino and Mirabeau (T5). At this point, VER was 0.146sec behind ALO.   
VER gained some speed on ALO between Mirabeau and the Hairpin (T6), but failed to make advancements at the Hairpin, second Mirabeau (T7), Portier (T8) and through the tunnel (T9). Worse, ALO had a better approach of Nouvelle (T10&11), carrying more top speed into Tabac (T12), where he also made a better approach with lifting later. VER was then, after Tabac and the end of sector 2, 0.204sec behind ALO.   
Going into the swimming pool, VER hustled through T13&14, gaining some speed on ALO. Taking also a bit more speed through T15&16 and having a higher top speed exiting T17. Inbetween Rascasse (T18) and the final turn, T19, VER stepped onto the gas slightly more than ALO, allowing for a better exit out of the final turn.   
In the final sector, VER gained 0.288sec on ALO, securing pole position by 0.084sec and hitting the wall atleast three times in the final sector (apex of T15, exit of T19 and the opposite wall on the start-finish-straight.","['S3 was bad for Aston Martin, they were slow there during the whole weekend if i remember correctly', ""Alonso's Q3 S3 was slowest of pretty much anyone in the top 10, if I recall from the sector times it was slower than some of those who exited in Q2.

One, Alonso had a poor final sector compared to the rest of the field in Q3, he did all his damage in sectors one and two.
