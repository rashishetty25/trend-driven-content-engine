Let us remember that in Hungary what the French TP called \'evolved bottom\' had debuted, with the first artificial corrections made thanks to CFD analysis and without spending hours in the tunnel , to correct part of the problems encountered with the Montmel√≤ package.

Yes, he is a Honda driver. So? Does anyone seriously think he would bail to Aston Martin at the first moment if he was given the chance while in a way more competitive seat?

My point is that all these arguments about Honda links tying down Yuki are unfounded hogwash used to justify not hiring the better VCARB driver. And make no mistake, Yuki is better than Lawson, but whatever myopic bean counting faction in Red Bull management does not want him there, irrespective of any engine manufacturer. I believe it was Takuma Sato who said something very recently about only being able to hope now in respect to RBR's driver choice. This is a guy who has an executive advisor role at HRC; they do not give a fuck about tying Yuki down for no reason, in fact, they would be thrilled for him to get the opportunity at the main team.

Maybe he isn't but i would pick him over Yuki in that regard.\n\nI don't get this Yuki hype currently. He just hasn't showed that much potential in his career so far. He is a fine driver and good enough for VCARB and maybe as a second driver at Aston (as long as Stroll retires) in the future but he is definitely not the next Max Verstappen. Of course Liam isn't either but he at least has that x-factor to be a good second RB driver. Yuki is going into his fifth season and hasnt really made a name for himself in regards to work ethic and resilience. So i personally would also have picked Liam."", 'Just like how Perez‚Äôs sponsor kept him in that seat for 2024, Hondas history with Yuki probably played a role in him not getting the promotion.

1hhpb3x,the Yuki bias?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hhpb3x/the_yuki_bias/,2024-12-19, Discussion,"I don't get all the Yuki love. I mean sure he's lovable but is that enough to get the RB seat? Feels more like a train everyone had boarded, logic be darned. Not saying he's a bad driver or that he doesn't deserve the seat, as he did his time but Lawson just makes way more sense.

Trial by fire because the grid in 2025 is going to be tight. That's the RBR way, feels like a return to old ways. Lawson is going to have to be up to the task, swim or sink. If he swims they'll have a good partnership for 2026. If he sinks, they'll get another, more experienced driver off the market for 2026.

Also Yuki's contract has one more year on it, Honda and their weird decision (again) to leave F1 hurt Yuki more than anything. Getting Yuki, they'd have to get a fresh driver for 2026, an year of unknowns. Better to have someone next to Max that has had some lashes of the whip that is going to be 2025. If Honda had stayed and got on the RBRPT project, 100% Yuki would have gotten the seat.

Having said that and Honda going to Stroll. Yuki in an AM vs Lawson in RBR in 2026 is going to be spicy.","['I mean we‚Äôre saying ‚Äòtrial by fire‚Äô but that didn‚Äôt work for Gasly or for Albon then they went with the experienced driver and that worked for multiple years before going downhill. Other than Max it‚Äôs just not worked and do we think Liam is another Max? Even Max had a full year at Toro Rosso with some mega performances which showed everyone that he was something special. \n\nI think the frustration is that Yuki has always shown he‚Äôs quick but he had to tone down his temper and become more consistent which he‚Äôs shown to have done. Other than the one incident at the beginning of the year he‚Äôs remained calm and consistent since. He‚Äôs also consistently outperformed every teammate he‚Äôs had. I think people are frustrated about this in the same way they were frustrated at Checo‚Äôs poor performance being allowed to go on so long.\n\nI hope Liam does well but I also hope Yuki can get out of the RB circus and get a chance to shine.', ""Truth is that no one 'deserves' a seat in f1. There will always be factors outside that play a role in who gets the seat. Tsunoda is a pretty good driver, but he isn't what RBR want"", 'I mean I think one of the biggest arguments is that because Yuki would be out 2026, there‚Äôs no harm in putting him in for 2025. If he sucks then they can drop him anyways. And having Liam in vcarb gives him more time and experience to develop as a driver without the harm of having max as your teammate. It was a win win.', 'There are much more nuisances in this situation than what Yuki deserves and what Lawson does not deserve.\n\nOn Lawson, is he a good drive with more potential? Yes. Is he an immediate WDC contender that can challenge Max? We can quite confidently say no. Not able to beat an experienced driver like Yuki does not mean he is bad, but it proves he doesn‚Äôt show his potential yet. For this type of driver, there is no rush to promote him, and giving him time to develop in the junior team is the best scenario to shape him into a reliable rear gunner. Why can‚Äôt he do that in RBR? To my opinion, RBR is not really a team for development. Their patience is thin, and they expect him to perform immediately, in a car that in 2024 even Max said sometimes it is not easy to drive. The constant pressure to a driver who only drove 11 races is a lot. Lawson could navigate it very well, and that means he will be with Max long term. If it doesn‚Äôt go well, RBR WCC position takes another hit with only one driver delivering for the team again. Fast tracking Lawson could setback his career development.\n\nDo I support RBR to promote Yuki because he deserves it? No. Do I expect he would be competitive against Max? No. Do I think he could contribute more than Lawson in the immediate term? To some extent, Yes. Yuki is objectively more ready to take the RBR seat within the RB stable, given his performance and also experience, and also let Lawson to develop more. If he is really really good, RBR can keep him until they see the next Max regardless of the Honda deal. Honda was clear thst they will support Yuki even he is not driving with their engines. If he is not good, RBR wants to sack him anyway, there are no harms.\n\nThe only reason for RBR to pick Lawson over Yuki now is if they think Lawson will perform better immediately in 2025 alongside Max which I am not convinced. I am more inclined to say RBR wants to burn through their Junior drivers until they have Linblad ready to drive for RBR. \n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.', 'Its not ""Yuki Bias""... \n\nI saw it the other way, It is more like Tsunoda ""hate"" are more strange because people stuck in the past...

Liam Lawson was the obvious choice surely? Tsunoda being a Honda driver, he‚Äôs probably going to leave for Aston Martin in 2026 following either Alonso‚Äôs retirement or then finally dropping Stroll. I know he‚Äôs had a large majority of his career with the RB family but he‚Äôs only there thanks to Honda supplying the engine.

Knowing this, Red Bull don‚Äôt want someone who‚Äôll be there for a year then leave, they want someone young to potentially be Verstappen‚Äôs successor (Ricciardo to Vettel).

With Hadjar most likely getting the vacant VCARB spot, if Lawson pulls a Gasly, I can see RB going for Hadjar instead of Tsunoda too. 

No shade on Yuki, on his day he can be amazing. I just don‚Äôt think Red Bull will want to waste time and money on a driver they know won‚Äôt be there next year.","['Alonso has a contract 2026 and stroll has an infinite contract, there is no space for him at Aston?!', '> Tsunoda being a Honda driver, he‚Äôs probably going to leave for Aston Martin in 2026\n\nWell, no, because why would he do that if he has a race-winning car?', ""The biggest reason is experience. Maybe people wouldn't be as hesitant about Lawson being promoted if he had more than 11 GP under his belt, like a full season or 2. Though that didn't help Gasly. \n\nBoth would probably falter alongside Max Verstappen, very few can probably keep up with him honestly, I just hope he can do better than Perez.\n\nAlso being a Honda driver shouldn't mean squat."", ""Tsunoda getting into F1 with Honda does not at all mean he has to stay with them several years after the fact. It's such a weird idea that this would be the case, when for all other drivers we are open to movement between teams according to their performance. Especially since Tsunoda *also* has been a driver for a Red Bull team even if he didn't come from their junior program. If Tsunoda performed better than Lawson it would be very natural to give him an offer to drive in the Red Bull car."", ""I don't even think its about Honda. Red Bull have the power to buy Yuki away from Honda and make him a Red Bull driver. \n\nThey just think that he has reaches his ceiling and that this is his pace. Clearly it isn't enough. They see Lawson holding his own against Yuki despite much less experience and are willing to take the slim chance that Lawson will grow much further into a driver that can support Max. \n\nThe choice between Yuki and Liam was one where Yuki would have definitely struggled and one where Liam will struggle at the start but may grow."", ""Because Tsunoda is better and if offered would jump at the chance. Also I'm sure if needed he'd happily break the Honda link if it meant getting the chance to win races."", 'If you think Alonso will retire before the 2026 season where there is a new set of regulations and an Adrian Newey designed car you are insane!', 'There is no way Lawrence Stroll is replacing a 2x world champion with Yuki Tsunoda.

He is going after a top driver once Alonso retires.', 'For the reason you stated Yuki is a Honda driver promote him let Max destroy him and then get rid of him next year if that‚Äôs what happens, alternatively he impresses and you make him a RB driver not a Honda one.

	2.	Exceptional Driving Talent: Lawson‚Äôs success in lower formulae, including winning races in Formula 2 and his consistent strong results, demonstrates his raw speed and racecraft. He has shown the ability to compete at a high level, even against more experienced drivers.
	3.	Work Ethic and Mental Toughness: Lawson has displayed a strong work ethic, which is essential for a driver at the highest level. His ability to stay focused and perform under pressure is crucial, especially when racing for a top-tier team like Red Bull.
	4.	Red Bull‚Äôs Trust in Development: Lawson is part of the Red Bull Junior Team, and the team‚Äôs trust in him speaks volumes. His development within the Red Bull system shows that they believe in his potential to contribute significantly to the team.
	5.	Future of Red Bull Racing: As a young driver, Lawson offers long-term potential for Red Bull Racing. If he continues to improve, he could be a key part of their future, alongside Max Verstappen or potentially as a future team leader.
