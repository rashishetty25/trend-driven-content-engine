1kmeizt,"On this day 30 years ago, the Formula 1 career of 1992 champion Nigel Mansell came to an end at the Spanish Grand Prix, pulling into the pits voluntarily to end his brief and disastrous spell with McLaren.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kmeizt/on_this_day_30_years_ago_the_formula_1_career_of/,2025-05-14, Throwback,,"[""The joke at the time was that Mansell couldn't fit into the car because his wallet was so big."", ""After his very lucrative return to the sport at the end of 1994 (bagging him 2.7 million dollars in just three races, nine times as much as his team mate Damon Hill made all year), Mansell was not retained by the Williams team, who opted for a youthful approach, hiring David Coulthard instead. Mansell at this point was far and away the oldest driver on the grid, more than five years older than Martin Brundle and Roberto Moreno.\n\n\n\nMansell then signed with McLaren as their title sponsor Marlboro wanted a World Champion (while the team themselves and their engine supplier were opposed to the idea). Mansell was to be teamed with future champion Mika Häkkinen.\n\n\n\nThe 1995 season began in an embarrassing fashion for the team as Mansell could simply not fit into the car, and Mark Blundell drove the first two races in his stead. Mansell's first start for Mclaren in Imola didn't end well as he collided with Eddie Irvine with a points finish in sight, only finishing 10^(th). Frustrated with the car's handling and uncompetitiveness, Mansell came into the pits on lap 18 of the Spanish Grand Prix, got out of the car and called it quits. Mark Blundell was once again called up, finishing off the rest of the season for the team, ironically having to make way for David Coulthard in 1996.\n\n\n\nMany years later, in 2015, Mansell said he regretted this decision and that he should've continued on, attempting to improve the car.\n\n\n\nMansell tested on the very same track for the Jordan team a year later, but decided against a comeback, despite the team's sponsors being willing to pay for his services."", ""I'm just old enough to remember the (small) ripple of excitement in Ireland when the Jordan rumours were circulating."", 'Now there’s a mustache you could set your watch to.', '30 years ago we had 2 of the best mustaches to ever race in their respective sports.

Interestingly, both drivers have needed 7 front row starts before securing their first pole position.

Max Verstappen's top 2 qualifying's until his first pole position:  
\- Belgium 2016 - P2  
\- Singapore 2017 - P2  
\- Mexico 2017 - P2  
\- Singapore 2018 - P2  
\- Mexico 2018 - P2  
\- Austria 2019 - P2  
\- Germany 2019 - P2  
\- **Hungary 2019 - P1**

Oscar Piastri's top 2 qualifying's until his first pole position:  
\- Japan 2023 - P2  
\- Monaco 2024 - P2  
\- Hungary 2024 - P2

1kmfd97,Lewis Hamilton comment on Max Verstappen’s driving style in interview for Netflix’s Drive to Survive Season 4 “Gloves Are Off” bears striking similarities to Lando Norris’ comment after Miami GP 2025,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kmfd97/lewis_hamilton_comment_on_max_verstappens_driving/,2025-05-14, Discussion,"I only post this because as I’m rewatching DTS on Netflix, Lewis’ comment about his huge crash with Max, that came close to killing Lewis if not for the halo, reminded me so much of what Lando said recently about Max during the debacle at the first/second turn of the Miami Grand Prix two weeks ago.

Lewis says, “Max is kind of do or die. It’s like you’re either crashing or you’re…or you’re not going by.” Lando says “It’s crash or don’t pass with Max,” and of course so many people gave him shit especially when Oscar managed to “easily” pass Max later on in the race to then go on to win.

It’s no secret that race control and the stewards let Max get away with a lot of shit that I would argue played a large part in why he brought home his first championship in 2021 and why he continued to dominate in the years following, but if a 7 time F1 Drivers Champion, whose more than proven himself in this sport, shares a very similar sentiment about Max and his not only aggressive but dangerous race craft, why did so many people give Lando so much shit? And continue to give him shit even going on to discuss things like he’s not mentally fit to be champion, no longer #1, etc etc. 

I’m incredibly confused by the phenomena. I suppose it can simply boil down to people simply hate on Lando because he’s Lando, but I found that specifically the reaction to that statement to be the most bizarre? Especially considering Max’s dangerous driving style is nothing new and is in fact why so many of his fans love him. Was the comment that ridiculous? And correct me if I’m wrong didn’t it take Oscar more laps to pass Max than it took for Lando to pass him?
","[""''why he continued to dominate in the years following'' - Ah yes, who doesn't remember the elbows out racing of Verstappen to win the 2022 & 2023 seasons by just a few points."", '8/10 rage bait.\nGood job', ""Norris struggles with race craft. Monza 2024 is a good example. But Miami 2025 is an even better one. He should have backed off but chose to stay on the outside which led him to lose positions. Max really didn't do anything wrong there."", 'If you lived in the Schumacher/Senna era, your head would have exploded, OP', '*It’s no secret that race control and the stewards let Max get away with a lot of shit*\xa0\n\nSo how did you perceive all the divebombs and ""forcing another driver off"" by Lando in Austria last year? Just good and aggressive driving, I\'m sure?', "">I suppose it can simply boil down to people simply hate on Lando because he’s Lando\n\nNobody dislikes a driver because they are <Driver>\n\nMax's style is aggressive, but he will also drive to the absolute limits of the interpretations of the law, and will selectively encroach over the line if it is beneficial for him to do so.  Max hasn't done a lot of pure racing in the last 4 years because the RBR has been so dominant but in races where, say the Ferrari was competitive, he'd race LEC incredibly hard and fair.  Similarly, racing Piastri, he defended hard, but also fair and not in a dangerous way.  It took a few laps for Piastri to set him up but both were complimentary of each other after the race.\n\nNorris saying that VER ruined his own race and should be worried about the championship while he himself is being outclassed by his teammate with 80+ less races worth of experience is what is causing people to not like Norris."", 'Did you watch 22 and 23 or are you just making stuff up?

You have to make a decisive move, then all is fine. Its just drivers that have a tendency of the former get in trouble with Verstappen. And beyond them being wrong, both are just politicking, if you can keep on planting a seed in the minds of the stewarding that driver X who is your competitor is dangerous you might be able to get an advantage out of it.\n\n>It’s no secret that race control and the stewards let Max get away with a lot of shit \\[...\\]\n\nComplete nonsense.\n\nI dont hate a single driver, but I will also call out any driver on saying bs off track (i will not hold what is said while driving against them). If calling someone out on their bs is considered hating by you, then you need to go outside and go offline for a bit until you manage to recalibrate your senses.']",0,178,0.19,0,165,165,0,-1,0.010000000000000009,0
