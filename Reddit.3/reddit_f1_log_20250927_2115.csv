He's recovered well in VCARB.  Sadly Yuki has inherited the pain of that awful second seat.  He's coming around recently though, and if he finishes off the season well, maybe pulls a podium out of his hat, I think the teams should be kept as Max/Yuki and Liam/Hadjar.  I feel like both teams are stabilizing well and could both grow further with one more year."", ""It must also sting a bit for Yuki knowing the car you had an influence in developing operating so well across the season. All this while you're struggling to even finish in the points in a car that should be faster but you can't really get a handle on.
