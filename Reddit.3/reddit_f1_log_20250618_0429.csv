1ldq23r,Got lucky and went to the F1 Movie premiere last night so here are my thoughts (no spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ldq23r/got_lucky_and_went_to_the_f1_movie_premiere_last/,2025-06-17, Discussion,"Hey all, I was lucky enough to win tickets to the world premiere of the new F1 movie last night (I never win tickets so 100% felt it wasn't real until I had them that night!), and I figured some of you might be curious about how it holds up, especially as fans.

Here are my main takeaways:

1. **The racing scenes are pretty incredible.** I'm not super into action, so maybe others will appreciate this even more than me but they feel fast, raw, pretty real and completely embedded in the F1 world. You can tell they put a lot of effort into shooting on track and used a lot of actual race footage which was cool. I recognised some of the moments from the season.
2. **The Apex GP team is really well done.** It felt like they genuinely belonged on the grid. I left wanting to follow them like they were a real team, kind of like how I get invested in certain back marker teams via Drive to Survive. 
3. **There are a few unrealistic bits.** Nothing huge, but if you're a fan, you'll definitely know some moments or 'liberties' were taken for the sake of the storyline. That said, it didn‚Äôt ruin the experience for me, it was funny at times (should have at least been a yellow...).
4. **A lot of Easter eggs for fans.** There were definitely a lot of nods to F1 fans/the fandom - down to the right pets being in the paddock. I appreciated that and it‚Äôs clear the movie was made with fans in mind.

As for the premiere itself, it was definitely a cool experience, though I wish there had been a bit more for the fans. I don‚Äôt think the drivers stayed for the screening (most of the big names left after a short on-stage intro). I understand though as I guess it was more of an industry/influencer event. So overall it still felt surreal to be there, saw some F1 personalities and I feel incredibly lucky to have experienced it. Especially just being in the same room as Lewis Hamilton, that was enough ha.

What impact will the McLaren collision have on the team structure? And how could Nico Rosberg possibly help Norris?**\n\n> Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once wrote the following lines in his poem ""The Sorcerer\'s Apprentice"": ""The spirits I summoned, I will not be rid of now."" After the tenth Grand Prix of the year, this sentence could almost be applied identically to the best Formula 1 team of this season.\n\n> Ahead of the Canadian Grand Prix, drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris spoke to the media on Thursday (June 12). After the first third of the season, it had become clear that Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris were likely to battle it out for the world championship title. While the competition exhibited more erratic performance, McLaren shone with consistency.\n\n> The drivers know this, too. Regarding past internal team friction in the fight for the World Championship crown, Norris wisely said, ""Something will happen at some point."" And just three days later, he put his own words into action at the Montreal race.\n\n> Norris attacked Piastri in the hairpin on lap 66. However, his rival braked later before the final chicane and stayed ahead. Norris gained more momentum on the finish straight and tried to position himself to the left of the sister car. However, there was no room because the championship leader was covering the inside lane. Norris slammed into the rear of his teammate and then into the concrete wall. His race was over, and Piastri retained his fourth place.\n\n> **""It was only a matter of time.""**\nAbout an hour after the race, team principal Andrea Stella spoke to the journalists on site. The boss of the two rivals seemed composed: ""It was only a matter of time. It wasn\'t a question of \'if,\' but of \'when.\' Now we have certainty and can say: \'Canada 2025.\' Of course, we don\'t want that at McLaren. We\'ll have to have some discussions now.""\n\n> However, the famous ""papaya rules"" are not being put under review. There won\'t be a complete ban on attacks by team orders: ""Of course, we could control everything from the command post, but we don\'t want that. That would be artificial racing. We want to give both drivers the chance to fight for positions ‚Äì also among themselves,"" explained Stella.\n\n> Norris himself had already apologized for the incident in the car. He then doubled down in the press conference. ""I simply misjudged it. It was my mistake, I take full responsibility, and I apologize to my entire team and to Oscar for attempting something like that.""\n\n> As Piastri spoke to journalists in the mixed zone, Norris approached him and apologized personally with a handshake to the Australian. Stella emphasized Norris\'s behavior: ""It\'s good that Lando immediately took responsibility. He simply misjudged the situation on the track. I\'m sure he\'ll learn from this and emerge stronger.""\n\n> **Does Norris need mental help?**\nSome experts may disagree. While Piastri has made fewer mistakes this year and is also assessing situations better in most duels, Norris seems to repeatedly slip up under pressure. He already made two errors in qualifying. Piastri started the Montreal GP, which was a poor performance by McLaren standards, from P3, while Norris had to start from seventh.\n\n> The fact that the two ultimately clashed on Sunday was also due to their differing strategies. Piastri used the medium rubber in the first stint, then switched to the hard tires twice. Norris preferred to start the race on the C4 tire. The long first stint and the intermediate sprint on the medium brought him within striking distance of his World Championship rival.\n\n> But Norris\'s good race pace ultimately didn\'t help him. Last year\'s runner-up left Canada 22 points behind Piastri. As he walked through the paddock, the weight of the defeat was evident on his face. He took a deep breath and kept his head down.\n\n> **Rosberg offers Norris help.**\nFormer champion and Sky expert Nico Rosberg has often noticed the Formula 1 driver\'s ups and downs. The former Mercedes driver knows from personal experience the psychological strain of a World Championship battle. He believes Norris needs a mentor of sorts to support him off the track, like Mark Webber does with Piastri.\n\n> ""I\'ve already offered him my help and written to him. But unfortunately, he hasn\'t responded. Maybe it will still happen,"" Rosberg revealed in front of the cameras. Rosberg himself had brought a mental coach onto the team during the 2016 season. The psychological support also helped him win the 2016 World Championship battle against Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton.\n\n> Rosberg subsequently decided to retire. After three years of friction and internal battles, calm returned to Mercedes. McLaren isn\'t quite there yet. Canada was the first incident of this kind. But the ghosts themselves summoned them.', 'McLaren have constructors on lock and both of them have quite a big gap to Verstappen. Just let them race.', 'They need rules of engagement.\n\nTeam orders won‚Äôt work here. They‚Äôre each others championship rival.', 'There will be no team orders. They‚Äôll both hit the roof, the wall and each other but there will be no team orders. Piastri was met with silence when he asked for orders in Australia and Suzuka. Norris was also met with silence when he queried team orders in Imola. They‚Äôll never have their way and it‚Äôs not because ‚Äòit‚Äôs how we go racing‚Äô, it‚Äôs because both of them have complex contracts that do not allow them to be treated any differently than the other. If they didn‚Äôt then one of them would be lording it over the other every time they needed help to get past and they were both on similar pace. And then the one who was constantly told to give up position would be the one who walked out of the door at the end of the season.']",7,21,0.57,7,164,164,-1,0,-0.020000000000000018,-1

It‚Äôs very interesting and insightful in terms of how everything is developing inside the team. \n\nIn chronological order from the video:\n\n\n- The ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù is partly due to underachieving expectations. At the beginning of the season, the target was the championship, and the current situation is merely fighting for podiums.\n\n- What Hamilton was referring to when he said, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a lot happening in the background that I can‚Äôt say publicly,‚Äù relates to an ongoing deep restructuring of the Gestione Sportiva (GES).\n\n- Vasseur, alongside D‚ÄôAmbrosio, is trying to fundamentally change Ferrari‚Äôs old management structures and has encountered internal backlash to these changes. One example is the frequency of upgrades.\n\n- Hamilton is deeply involved in this restructuring and trusts Vasseur.\n\n- They mention that Leclerc, despite delivering great results on track, isn‚Äôt taking on the leadership role in the way Hamilton is. This doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs unhappy or wants to leave.\n\n- Hamilton isn‚Äôt very present in the simulator ‚Äî which was expected ‚Äî but this initially caused some surprise within the team.\n\n- They mention that the SF-25, while under Vasseur‚Äôs responsibility, was mostly developed by technicians who are no longer part of the team and who followed an older philosophy.\n\n- New technicians and engineers are now working under Serra‚Äôs guidance and direction.\n\n- The guys note that internal change at Ferrari is very difficult due to the Italian nature of the organization and its people. As a consequence, when things don‚Äôt go well, ‚Äúbands‚Äù tend to form within the team.\n\n- Almost all of Binotto‚Äôs loyalists are now gone from the team.\n\n- There is no ‚Äúupper board‚Äù or ‚Äúhigher-ups‚Äù interfering in team matters. John Elkann (Ferrari‚Äôs Chairman) is the one who will decide whether Vasseur continues or not.\n\n- Antonello Coletta has declined the team principal role twice when Elkann offered it, prior to Vasseur‚Äôs arrival.\n\n- Christian Horner is considered a potential replacement if he were to become available. This isn‚Äôt likely ‚Äî unless Red Bull‚Äôs management no longer wants him, which cannot be entirely ruled out.\n\n- The team at AutoRacer emphasizes that the recent attacks on Vasseur are not well-founded, and much of the reporting has been vague about what‚Äôs really going on inside the team.\n\n- Vasseur has been very harsh to the Italian Press and he needs to learn how to deal with the pressure from the press. \n\n- They believe Vasseur will be renewed, and that this ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù is mostly a consequence of the deep changes underway at Ferrari. Ultimately, the decision lies with Elkann.\n\n\nIn summary, Ferrari is undergoing the deepest restructuring it has seen in the last few decades. The lack of results and the return to an uncompetitive and problematic car have exacerbated the difficulties Vasseur has faced in trying to restructure the team. There are a lot of changes happening, and Vasseur needs time to implement them.
