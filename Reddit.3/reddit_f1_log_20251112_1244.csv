1ouzdb2,Has the testing ban/limits stunted Ferrari performance?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ouzdb2/has_the_testing_banlimits_stunted_ferrari/,2025-11-12, Technical,"I recently listened to the High Performance Podcast where they spoke with Miki Hakkinen.

And one of the things Miki spoke about was his frustration that Ferrari were able to test so much more than McLaren (or any other team).

He basically said that after a bad race he knew Monday morning, Ferrari would be out on their test track. That as soon as a season was over, they'd be on their test track. And there was no limit to how long they could test for each day.

In contrast, McLaren had to go to Silverstone, where they could only run between 10:00 and 17:00 and it would be raining.

This got me thinking, that a lot of Ferrari's woes have come since the testing ban. Was their test track and near unlimited testing their golden goose?

Do you think Ferrari failed and still struggle with the limited testing? Unable to properly utilise simulation and wind tunnel and much perfered real world running to teat upgrade parts?","['I mean yeah. Thats a given.\n\nA track on the doorstep of your factory that you own will always be a massive benefit to you when you can test on it whenever you want and for how long you want.\n\nFerrari had cars running at Fiorano non stop back in the day. Schumacher who was a testing freak himself literally traveled from some European tracks to Fiorano to test mid race weekend.', ""*Mika.\n\nAnd yes, it's been an ever growing issue for years. Ferrari and Lotus were once the only teams with their own race tracks. Lotus had Hethel and of course Ferrari had Fiorano. \n\nOf the two, only Fiorano became a world class facility, and Ferrari used it a LOT. Elio de Angelis famously said he would never drive for Ferrari because he didn't want to live at Fiorano, he may have been exaggerating a little during the 80's but by the time Michael Schumacher arrived at Ferrari in 1997 that's exactly what Michael did - lived in an apartment (Enzo's old apartment actually) right on the circuit. Testing everyday and sometimes into the evening when it was practically dark.\n\nThis was of course a huge advantage for Ferrari and something that by this stage no other team could do."", 'No, i’ve heard somewhere they have the best mechanics and engineers. So shoulnt be a big thing', 'During the Schumacher years ferrari were relentless. At one point in 1998 Schumacher did 1400 km in 3 days at Fiorano - so over 5 Grand Prix distances.

However, it impacts all the other teams too. \n\nOther teams have seemingly adapted to the switch and having to use the digital world and simulation. Ferrari seems to struggle adapting to this. \n\nI was also listening to a podcast (I can’t remember which one). They mentioned that Ferrari designs their cars trying to take advance of Loopholes. When the loopholes close they are kind of screwed. I think they used the flexiwing as an example but again I forget. Idk how true their claim is but I found it interesting. \n\nMaybe everything I’m saying is bullshit though, I don’t pay attention to the technical side as much as I probably should.', ""100% testing and spending caps have heavily impacted Ferrari and others, you can see the fall off in performance when comparing before and after.\n\nThe big difference is how teams adapt to this change and it appears Ferrari has failed to do so which isn't surprising given their leadership are so prideful and stuck in the past, I can only imagine how many meetings Vasser must be fighting the urge to slap some sense into them.\n\nIf aston and others promises are half true there is a risk Ferrari would fall to mid tier ranking in the coming years which might wake them up."", 'No the problem is that they have world class engineers and mechanics but the drivers let down the team by talking excessively rather than driving.\xa0', 'I suggest you read Ross Brawn’s book about that time.

I agree that Oscar's penalty was not right as he got squeezed with nothing else he could have done. If anything it should just be a racing incident. 

  
However, I actually think what happened was that Kimi didnt even know Oscar was there as it looked like he was just aiming straight towards the apex. 

  
This happens way too often where the driver looks to simply not be checking their mirrors. 

  
Nearly every racing sim I play have proximity indicators (red arrow/circle that tells me theres a car alongside). I use these all the time when I am too focused on the corner, and unable to check my mirror/radar. It has saved me countless times. 

  
This is what F1 needs. Some kind of indicator on their steering wheel, a hud, or some audible indicator. I feel like it would improve the sport by making side by side racing more accessible.
