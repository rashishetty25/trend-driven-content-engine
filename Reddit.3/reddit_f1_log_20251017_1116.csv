The case, involving injuries caused to a traffic officer, has been closed by the preliminary investigations judge in Bologna.

While driving a black minivan, Antonelli Sr. reportedly tried to access the paddock area using his pass. Intending to turn onto a road outside the circuit, he was stopped by a traffic officer who informed him that the road was closed and he had to continue straight ahead.*\n\n> *In a video recorded by surveillance cameras and published by the newspaper La Verità, the black vehicle can be seen stopping while the officer, using his baton and hand gestures, indicates the correct route. After a brief exchange between Antonelli and the officer, the car turns left and, during the maneuver, hits the officer’s leg, before being stopped a few meters further ahead by other officers. In the video, the officer bends over, holding his knee, and is visibly limping. Another colleague then calls for medical assistance.*\n\n> *The officer was taken to the hospital, treated, and discharged with a diagnosis of a serious knee sprain with ligament injury, and a sixty-day recovery period. According to ANSA, the Bologna Prosecutor’s Office opened an investigation, which was later closed at the request of the judge, ruling that “the act did not constitute an offense” with regard to the charge of resisting a public officer. The charge of negligent injury was also dismissed, since the injured party did not file a formal complaint.*\n\n> *In the days following the incident, Antonelli apologized both to the injured officer and publicly, admitting his responsibility. Also speaking to ANSA, Imola’s mayor Marco Panieri explained:*\n\n> *“On May 21, after the accident, [the officer] came to my office accompanied by two deputy commanders. I put him in contact with Antonelli’s father so they could clear things up.

Thanks', '# The 2026 F1 “Green” Engines Aren’t Really That Green...\n\nEveryone keeps calling the 2026 engine regs a huge win for sustainability, but let’s be honest — it’s mostly PR.\n\n# What’s actually changingg\n\nThe new power units will drop the MGU-H, bump up electric power (MGU-K) from 120 kW to 350 kW, and run on synthetic “sustainable” fuel.  \nThe idea is to make F1 look cleaner and more future-proof. The reality? Bigger batteries, more weight, and slower cars.\n\n# Heavier cars, slower racing (just like the SUVs nowadays, a modern BMW SUV is over 2 tonnes...)\n\nTripling the electrical power means you need more energy storage. More storage = heavier batteries.  \nThe FIA says the cars will be “lighter overall,” but that’s mostly wishful thinking. Energy recovery will play a much bigger role, so drivers will be juggling deployment and regen instead of just driving flat out.\n\n**If people want to watch battery management and energy strategy, there’s already Formula E for that.**\n\n# The CO₂ comparison is kind of a joke...\n\nHere’s the thing: an F1 car over an entire race weekend burns roughly **220–250 kg of fuel**, or about **300 liters**.  \nThat’s roughly **700 kg of CO₂** for the whole weekend.\n\nNow compare that to Max Verstappen’s private jet — a Dassault Falcon 8X.  \nOne flight from Europe to Austin for the US GP burns around **12,000 kg of jet fuel** (about **15,000 liters**).  \nThat’s around **36 tons of CO₂** — about **50 times more** than his race car produces in a weekend.\n\n**And that’s one flight. Add up all the private jets, freight planes, and trucks that move the paddock around, and it’s obvious where the real emissions come from. The race fuel itself is barely a rounding error.**\n\n# The “green fuel” part isn’t what it sounds like\n\nSynthetic e-fuels can technically be carbon-neutral, but they take an insane amount of energy to make, and they still release CO₂ when burned.  \nThe only thing that makes them “green” is if the production process uses renewable energy and captured carbon — which is nice in theory but doesn’t make the cars any cleaner in practice.\n\n# So what’s the point?\n\n**The 2026 regs make the cars more complicated, more expensive, and likely slower — all for a “green” headline.**  \n**It doesn’t fix the real environmental footprint of F1, which comes from freight and travel, not what’s burned in the cars.**\n\n  \nAnd more boring races...', ""Why did they strike out Max's eyes?"", 'My thinking as well.

Time to lico for 50 laps."", '****\n**Hamilton confident Ferrari can take ‘step forward’ in Austin as he sets out expectation for final races of 2025**\n\nLewis Hamilton has set out his hopes for what Ferrari can achieve at the United States Grand Prix, a race in which team mate Charles Leclerc took victory in 2024.\n\nLewis Hamilton is hopeful that Ferrari can take a “step forward” by extracting more from their car during the United States Grand Prix weekend, with the seven-time World Champion admitting that the final six races of the campaign could play a key role in preparations for 2026.\n\nHamilton arrives into Round 19 of the season off the back of a P8 finish last time out in Singapore, having originally crossed the line in seventh before being handed a five-second time penalty post-race for exceeding track limits whilst managing a brake issue on his car.\n\nLooking ahead to what might be possible at the Circuit of The Americas – a track where he has previously been victorious on five occasions – Hamilton voiced an optimistic note about Ferrari’s prospects in terms of continuing to make improvements to the SF-25.\n\n“I never have expectations except for that we give it our all and we continue to improve,” the Briton said. “I think there are lots and lots of positives to take from every weekend, and there are lots of areas we can improve.\n\n“We spent time after the last race going through areas that we can improve on, and I really think that this weekend we can take a step forward and extract more from the car that we have.\n\n“We’ve not moved the car forward in terms of performance, but there is more performance in the car that, if we execute a little bit better, I think we can extract more, so that’s the goal.”\n\nWith the 2025 season now entering into its last six rounds – featuring three Sprints along the way, including this weekend at COTA – Hamilton was quizzed on what the approach will be and how the squad will find the answers they are seeking ahead of 2026, a year in which new technical regulations will be introduced into the sport.\n\n“These are ultimately test weekends, really, in terms of just continuing to learn, to improve on our processes,” he explained. “In the last races there have been a couple of gems through the weekend that we couldn’t capitalise on, and so it’s taking those good bits from there and continuing to work on them, to take what works and then change what isn’t [working].\n\n“So that’s what we’re trying to do moving forwards. I think it’s continuing to build on the relationships, continuing to build on communication.\n\n“Ultimately, everyone back at the factory really deserves a good result and that’s the sole focus – to get good results, try to maximise, squeeze every point we can out of our performances on the weekends, and I really, really believe that we can do that, so we just stay focused.”\n****', 'I know the prancing horse on that car just wants to gallop right off it out of shame.', 'Meanwhile Russell has two wins and a shipload of podiums.', 'Ferrari should set out their expectations for Lewis more like. \n\nA podiumless season is unacceptable.', 'angry upvote', 'only ferrari to win any race this season though', 'He’s been as good or better than Charles recently.
