The photos from the cars on track were made from the inside of the track at Eau Rouge/Raidillon from the top of a building.

1m5dzlu,The F1 movie from the perspective of an F1 fan versus someone who doesn't know the sport,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m5dzlu/the_f1_movie_from_the_perspective_of_an_f1_fan/,2025-07-21, Discussion,"I recently saw the F1 movie together with a buddy of mine who is really not into motorsports or any kind - but it's an avid movie watcher (and can be a fairly tough critic). 

I'll try not to spoil anything, but it was very interesting how different our experiences were. 

As someone who has been watching F1 since the late 90s, it was a really mixed bag. Like a long advertisement for F1, where they pretty much threw a bunch of money at some grad A artists and hoped for the best. To be fair, everyone was really professional (Bardem absolutely kills it as usual, Kerry Condon steals most of the scenes she's in), and the imagery on the track is fantastic. But the way they insert F1 personalities and elements, felt really artificial, and more like a caricature of F1. 


However, my friend loved the movie. Without any prior F1 knowledge, he was glued to the screen, and he was really impressed by the whole atmosphere and the feeling of speed from the cars. He says it reminded him of Top Gun Maverick (which is a fair comparison, given how much in-car footage there is). It also helped a lot that they do a good job explaining the more technical terms of the sport. 

TL;DR: the movie succeeds in making F1 interesting for the average viewer that's out of the loop, but it might be a mixed bag if you know a thing or two about the sport.","['I have been watching F1 since 1992 and I am just happy they filmed a big movie about the sport that I love.\xa0\n\n\nIt is inaccurate and sometimes unrealistic, but I can watch any race for accuracy and realism - this one is pure enjoyment for me. Entertainment.', ""Yeah, that'll always be the case with whatever the subject of a movie is.\n\nI'm sure that in a bunch of science based films that I enjoy, someone who knows the subject matter is going to be a little bit irked at the contents of the film.\n\nIt's a piece of fiction that has a ton of high profile cameos. Enjoy it for what it is."", 'My dad been a fan since the 70s and he loved it. So did I. Its a film, a lot of rules wont apply. As someone who loves history as well, you have no idea how much Braveheart and Gladiator messed up and they are still so highly regarded and rightly so. They are fantastic movies.\n\nRocky makes a mockery of boxing (and you dont even need to be a fan to see it, the fight is ridiculous) and it won an Oscar. The F1 movie is obviously not on that level, but it was a fun 2 hour romp. I will definitely rewatch it soon.', 'I enjoyed it, but had to leave my F1 head outside. Definitely a film for non/casual F1 fans.', 'Top Gun Maverick and the F1 Movie had the same director which goes some way to feeling that comparison.', ""Basically what everyone has said so far. It's made to bring new fans to the sport rather than to cater to the niche hardcore/veteran F1 fanbase. Documentaries exist for the latter."", ""I split my appreciation in two. My general film enjoyer side appreciated it as a cool fun blockbuster. My F1 fan side just found a lot of it pretty funny with things like the Hungary crashfest or Toto's cameo"", "" best scene in the F1 movie wasn't related to F1 at all"", 'One thing that I particularly disliked about the movie is that they never showed quali.

1m5iu3x,Why McLaren's approach to introducing F1 upgrades is different from rival teams,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m5iu3x/why_mclarens_approach_to_introducing_f1_upgrades/,2025-07-21, News,,"['> In all these instances, the delay in racing the new parts wasn’t due to underperformance, but rather to a carefully thought-out plan. By collecting on-track data, McLaren was able to verify the correlation, checking whether the upgrades delivered what was expected based on wind tunnel and CFD simulations.\n\n> This cautious rollout has helped McLaren avoid problems that have plagued other teams in recent years, such as correlation issues or unexpected side effects - issues Ferrari encountered after introducing a new floor in Barcelona last year, whereas Christian Horner has spoken many times about the handicap of Red Bull’s outdated windtunnel.\n\nThis definitely feels like a luxury afforded to them by their large performance delta this year relative to other teams. I believe that testing new parts is fairly common during practice sessions, but how often do we see front-running teams do this, confirm good data, and choose to *not* use the parts in that weekend’s race?', 'There’s no substitute for running new parts on track. Wind tunnels and computers can only tell you so much. McLaren also helped by being in the lead so changes can be staggered.', '“It’s working.”', 'That was built over years though. The delta came as a result of their approach, not the other way around.', 'Based on the number of good upgrades they’ve made, it seems like they’ve been doing this at least since they were back of the pack in 2023', '""It\'s Woking""']",47,8,0.9,47,6,6,19,3,0.030000000000000027,19

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY “NEW”.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!
