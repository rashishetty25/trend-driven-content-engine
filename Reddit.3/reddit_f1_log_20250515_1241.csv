1kmeizt,"On this day 30 years ago, the Formula 1 career of 1992 champion Nigel Mansell came to an end at the Spanish Grand Prix, pulling into the pits voluntarily to end his brief and disastrous spell with McLaren.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kmeizt/on_this_day_30_years_ago_the_formula_1_career_of/,2025-05-14, Throwback,,"[""The joke at the time was that Mansell couldn't fit into the car because his wallet was so big."", ""After his very lucrative return to the sport at the end of 1994 (bagging him 2.7 million dollars in just three races, nine times as much as his team mate Damon Hill made all year), Mansell was not retained by the Williams team, who opted for a youthful approach, hiring David Coulthard instead. Mansell at this point was far and away the oldest driver on the grid, more than five years older than Martin Brundle and Roberto Moreno.\n\n\n\nMansell then signed with McLaren as their title sponsor Marlboro wanted a World Champion (while the team themselves and their engine supplier were opposed to the idea). Mansell was to be teamed with future champion Mika Häkkinen.\n\n\n\nThe 1995 season began in an embarrassing fashion for the team as Mansell could simply not fit into the car, and Mark Blundell drove the first two races in his stead. Mansell's first start for Mclaren in Imola didn't end well as he collided with Eddie Irvine with a points finish in sight, only finishing 10^(th). Frustrated with the car's handling and uncompetitiveness, Mansell came into the pits on lap 18 of the Spanish Grand Prix, got out of the car and called it quits. Mark Blundell was once again called up, finishing off the rest of the season for the team, ironically having to make way for David Coulthard in 1996.\n\n\n\nMany years later, in 2015, Mansell said he regretted this decision and that he should've continued on, attempting to improve the car.\n\n\n\nMansell tested on the very same track for the Jordan team a year later, but decided against a comeback, despite the team's sponsors being willing to pay for his services."", ""I'm just old enough to remember the (small) ripple of excitement in Ireland when the Jordan rumours were circulating."", 'Now there’s a mustache you could set your watch to.', '30 years ago we had 2 of the best mustaches to ever race in their respective sports.

Monza has always been the ItalianGP and has been on the F1-calendar since the start in 1950. Whereas Imola was added to the calendar in 1980 and only hosted the ItalianGP in its first year.

1kmwkmw,What would have to happen for certain drivers to win?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kmwkmw/what_would_have_to_happen_for_certain_drivers_to/,2025-05-15, Discussion,"Obviously, Max, Oscar, & Lando have won the way it was, but for the rest of them, what would have to happen for them to win at current state? 

For example - i think something would have to happen to both McLarens and Max for George to pull away with a win. I don’t think he gets around them on a normal weekend. 

On the other hand - I think poor Borteleto would need practically the entire field DSQ or DNF to get the win due to the car and him being a rookie. I’m not sure who I think he could realistically beat. 

I think Leclerc could pull a win as long as one McLaren was out of the running, and Ferrari didn’t do Ferrari things but it would still be tricky. 

What do you guys think? ","['Weird wins happen. Not often but they do.  The answer 99% of the time is rain.', ""A lot. Mostly luck, and with help from other drivers.\n\nOcon won in 2021 because of the bowling incident, which damaged Max's Red Bull. Lewis started on Inters on a dry track, and Alonso defended like the madman he is.\n\nFor midfield teams, they need something to happen at the right place at the right time and on a track that is difficult to overtake on.\n\nBackmarker teams..well, a lot of luck. Hulk managed to drag the Sauber to points in the Australian GP so that's something"", ""George needs a solid qualifying and for 1 McLaren to have a bad time to pull a win. The Ferraris need a cavalcade of nonsense. Max just needs a good qualifying and a track that's hard to pass.\n\nEveryone else essentially needs conditions that don't exist anymore. Pretty much Brazil last year....but more chaotic."", 'Luck, timely safety cars. Probably a retirement or two from the top contenders for any of the midfield guys to win. Mercedes are close they could win on strategy and Ferrari? Well Lewis technically did win albeit a sprint race', 'Lucky tire strategy and safety car can get MOST of the grid a win depending on timing of both and the track. Even those would be virtually impossible for some to be able to pull out a W just because the pace advantage is so titanic. If you got mega lucky with one/both at say Monaco you can virtually lock out a win because passing is next to impossible no matter the pace difference.', ""I don't think George is that far away.  Top 3 quali puts him there.  He'd need a Mclaren to have an issue on most tracks though."", 'When someone has an unusual advantage, midfield wins can happen. Often these are caused by rain, but it could be something else. Like the two McLarens crash into each other and someone like Gasly was running in somewhere like sixth from running a long stint on hards, and he gets a discounted pitstop at exactly the right time managed to sneak a win, while the people who pitted earlier lost time stuck in an Albon train. Penalties, crashes, weather, cheap pitstops, usually a couple things have to go right for a midfield or lower win. We were very close to having an Ocon win last year, and at that point in the year, that Alpine was really horrible. (I think some people forget how horrible that Alpine was because of all the points they scored that day and because Gasly got a good upgrade for the last two races of the season.)', 'There would need to be a scenario like when Magnussen was the only driver on wets which allows him to literally blast through the field, then from there they would have to make every ideal timeline strategy and also have the race get red flagged and called partway.', ""George is in a more reliable car than Max (whose car can wildly fluctuate in performance). His main opposition are the McLarens so it's really all about track/updates/being in form at the right time.""]",0,31,0.38,0,29,29,0,3,-0.010000000000000009,0
