1hdsorf,[Vasseur about Leclerc and Sainz] “I have never in all my time of racing seen two team-mates so intensely preoccupied with what the other one is doing.”,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hdsorf/vasseur_about_leclerc_and_sainz_i_have_never_in/,2024-12-14, News,,"['“I have never in all my time of racing seen two team-mates so intensely preoccupied with what the other one is doing,” says Ferrari’s boss Frederic Vasseur. “They were incredible in how hard they were pushing each other – out of the car too, in how much work they were putting in. I really believe that competitive fight between them has brought us performance.”', ""You know what, I absolutely believe him. I think their respective performances this year has shown that. Charles ran Norris close for P2 not mainly because the heroic drives he's known for (although he had a few of those this year), but by maximizing the weekend as much as he can. I think he's a little more consistent this year, and a lot more patient. He's much more willing to let the race come to him instead of overdriving the car like he has done a few times in the past. Those are all traits people used to, and still do, praise Carlos for.\n\nCarlos, on the other hand, I think has learned from Charles how to extract more from the car. Carlos has always been a rapid driver but if I'm not wrong, in terms of pace, this year Carlos has been closer to Charles than ever. This year he did his best quali performance against Charles, and I don't think there were a lot of times where Charles left him in the dust (with 20s+ gaps) in the race, like there were in 2021-2023. Sure you can argue this year's car might suit Carlos more, but I genuinely believe he has improved his quali and race pace. \n\nSo we can see how their respective main strengths have rubbed onto the other, which tbh is the best case scenario for any driver pairing."", ""The fact that they've never had a crash is mind blowing.

He is only talked when, “Yuki deserves the RB seat” instead of him. But I want to talk a bit about “his” carreer. He drove only 5 races in 2023 and 6 in 2024. He did not even completed a whole season worth of races, two seasons combined. He lacks of experience especially compared to Yuki’s “4 full seasons” of experience. I believe he is a decent driver and can be a regular top 10 if he gains experience. For now, of couse if there’s somebody to be promoted, it is Yuki. But it doesn’t mean that Liam is a bad driver. He didn’t even have a full season worth of drive (11 races in total, correct me if i’m wrong), so it is not reasonable to compare the two and saying Lawson is bad.  He should gain experience to avoid RBR’s Gasly & Albon situation.  Also, even though how much I want Yuki to promote to the dark blue car, I don’t think Red Bull would gave one of the seats to a Honda driver considering Ford engines will come in 2026.

New fan here, started watching F1 last year.

I’ve been doing some “research” for a while now. I’m currently watching every race from the 2012 season.

I simply hate how they used to display the gaps between drivers. You need to check the time really fast as it will soon disappear and show the gaps for the next group of cars.

I find it hard to follow on how the race is at that exact moment, comparing to nowadays where the times are always visible.

There are other things I don’t like, such as the radio messages, which have bad audio quality and that’s understandable, but providing subtitles doesn’t require that much technology.

The way they show the starting grid is also horrendous.

I don't think the scrolling positions along the bottom came in straight away but it happened as a result of those restrictions at least. With a lower resolution and less horizontal space on screen, having a vertical timing tower at all times would take up way more space, and they never changed that even after going widescreen in 2007 and eventually HD in 2011.\n\nThe fact that this finally changed in 2017 after Liberty took over suggests that this weird presentation style was something Bernie was still in charge of, which seems strange."", 'Yeah, people love to hate on Liberty but it was when they took over in 2017/2018 that the telemetry and presentation had a huge boost.', ""At least we didn't have the stupid AWS predictions onscreen and we had real images of tyres instead of the CGI version we have today while the actual tyres sit outside the Pirelli motorhome"", 'However many times I watch quali now, I just cannot get used to the double reference times on the new graphics. Bring back everything being P1+x.xxx.', ""Interestingly enough, there's a thread posted a bit before this that links to a profile on David Hill, the man responsible for shaking up F1's on screen graphics after Liberty bought it out.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hdp5bm/profile_of_the_guy_who_revamped_f1s_tv_broadcast/"", '""Old thing is outdated and not as good as new thing!""', '2015-2017 was my favourite. Very clean graphics', 'My guess would be that rather than Bernie being in charge of it, he just didn\'t prioritize it. \n\nI think it is more likely that at some point the person in charge of actually designing the graphics layout got let go, and the job fell to people who didn\'t have that in their skillset, so they just kept updating the old style until Liberty came in and said ""this simply will not do""', ""Having live timing showing the entire grid is a literal god send.\n\nIt's crazy that for YEARS we just had....nothing. eventually it would scroll to show a driver had retired a few laps ago without being mentioned."", 'Completely disagree. The graphics around 2016/17 were as good as they got. Compact, clear, and displayed all you needed. \n\nIt’s what, 6 years since they changed the graphics and yet they’re still oversized and still miss vital information regularly.']",0,24,0.17,0,23,23,0,1,-0.03,0
