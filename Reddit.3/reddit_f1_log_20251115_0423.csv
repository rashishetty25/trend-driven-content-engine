The meeting was chaired by FIA Single-Seater Director Nikolas Tombazis and FOM President and CEO Stefano Domenicali.

**2026 Technical and Sporting Regulations**

Following discussion at the meeting, a raft of refinements to the 2026 Technical, Sporting, Financial and Operational Regulations will be submitted to the World Motor Sport Council on December 10.

A proposal to explore mandatory two pit stops for grands prix was discussed along with adjustments to tyre specifications, tyre-life limits and the use of three compounds during the race. The discussion centred on feedback on analysis and simulations from teams and Pirelli. No changes were presently agreed, but it was agreed that talks on this topic would continue during the 2026 season.


**Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR)**

Changes to Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR) are being developed to bring Formula 1 into line with contemporary processing and simulation technology while mindful of cost considerations.


**Car liveries and driver numbers**

Following discussions with the Technical Advisory Committee, the topic of a minimum surface requirement limit for car liveries in 2026 was discussed.

It was agreed by Commission representatives that a minimum of 55% of surface area (when viewed from the side and above) must be covered by painted or stickered liveries as opposed to bare carbon fibre surfaces. The objective of this measure is to increase visual differentiation between cars.

Changes to the regulation on permanent competition numbers for drivers, introduced for the 2014 season, were discussed. It was agreed that a proposal for drivers to change their numbers during their career would be permitted.

 
**Driving Cooling System**

The potential mandating of the Driving Cooling System (DCS) for 2026 was discussed. Re-designs to the current DCS and cooling garments were proposed along with an increased weight allowance for use of the DCS. Further driver feedback will be sought in parallel with the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association (GPDA).","["">It was agreed that a proposal for drivers to change their numbers during their career would be permitted.\n\nI wonder who's going to be the first driver to change their number, considering it becomes a part of their branding identity.\n\n>a minimum of 55% of surface area (when viewed from the side and above) must be covered by painted or stickered liveries as opposed to bare carbon fibre surfaces.\n\nBasically this prevents another Alpine A524 scenario, i'm glad we'll see more colorful cars from now on.

The 55% paint is definitely a step in the right direction. Really happy to hear that.\n\nI think waiting to see the playing field in 2026 before mandating two stops is a good move because we don’t know how\xa0the new cars\xa0will handle tyres. In 2022 they thought tyres would be more durable but there were instead multiple three stoppers in the first half of 2022.\xa0', ""I'm sure that failure to meet 55% visible livery would just be a fine, but imagine the drama of a car getting DQ'd from a win because they changed their aero midseason but didn't adjust their livery and fell below that 55% and another team analyzed their paint and ratted them out."", 'Audi being streets ahead by revealing a livery that meets the guidelines before they’re announced', 'This sport needs a stewards solution.', ""I hope the livery restrictions are actually enforced. I'm sick of all the cars being 75% black.\n\n55% still seems pretty low though. I really miss the days of when the entire grid was colourful."", ""I think mandatory two stops is dumb. We saw what happen I believe in Qatar. Everyone had the same exact lineup and it suck. One stops aren't fun either if everyone does 90% of the race on one tire. What I want is tires that fall off a cliff again. Not tires losing only 5% of their performance so they eventually pit. I mean tires utterly falling off a cliff so that Lando gets blown past by the driver in last place if Yuki has fresh tires and blows past him. That the best. Say Max is chasing Lando for example. There only 15 laps left. The tires are good for 10 laps (I'm making stuff up so roll with it.) Lando tires might let him make it to the end but if they fall off it over. It be a nail biter till the end. I think Mexico 2023 was a good example with Lewis."", 'Something I’ve thought about is waiving the requirement for use of multiple compounds if 3 or more sets are used during the race.

Its by far the dumbest most idiotic suggestion i\'ve heard in a long long while. One that completely ignores all the actual issues with current tires and cars.\n\nSuch a change would also spit on everything that makes modern F1 so exciting at times with varying strategies.\n\nRussell not to be win at SPA? Gone. Leclercs Monza 1 stop heroics to win. Gone. Max\'s crazy good stint at Mexico? Gone. Lawson\'s heroics in Brazil? Gone gone gone.\n\nIf everyone is on a 2 stop all the time then how does that make racing more exciting?', 'The livery requirements will make the reveals fun.

1ox27zy,Norris vs. Piastri | Qualifying Gaps Visualized,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ox27zy/norris_vs_piastri_qualifying_gaps_visualized/,2025-11-14, Statistics,"Was curious so I wanted to take a look at how the qualifying gaps between Norris and Piastri have played out over the course of the season. I took a look at their gap between each other in actual time interval (seconds), and then also took a look at the gap between them as a percentage of overall lap time, to adjust for the range of different circuits' lap times. 

Notes:

* I excluded the races where either driver had a crash in Q3 (Jeddah for Norris, Baku for Piastri). I considered using their Q2 times, but Norris had the faster time in Q2 in Jeddah, so it didn’t really feel like it would be representative of their actual performances that weekend. If you want to take a look at what it would look like with Jeddah and Baku, [I made an alt graph here](https://imgur.com/a/JGc4GMM). For that one, I used Norris' Q2 time in Jeddah against Piastri's Q3 time, and used both of their Q2 times for Baku
* For Austria, I used Norris' first Q3 lap for comparison since Piastri was unable to get a second lap due to the yellow flag. Their actual gap in that qualifying was over 0.5s. if you’re curious what the graph would look like [I made another alternate here](https://imgur.com/a/qZrsiOd).
* I made both grand prix only and sprint inclusive versions to get a full picture of the entire season, since I know sprints are not usually considered in qualifying head-to-head records but ultimately still do show a trend on how teammates compare in a qualifying context. 

Let me know if you spot anything that doesn't look right in my numbers or methodology. I just thought it was interesting to visualize, interested to hear others' thoughts.","[""Cool comparison and it's interesting to see the way the tide shifted so dramatically\xa0\n\n\nI\xa0would say it's probably better to treat the data consistently unless you are going to have a more comprehensive cleaning process. So using the true final gap for all races, including Austria.\xa0\n\n\nIf external factors are going to be controlled for in one instance, you should really be going back through every session to validate that other results are not influenced by outside factors (e.g. Traffic, slipstream, etc).

Norris got the feel back and stopped messing up q3s', 'i actually would argue that lando being faster in jeddah DOES represent his pace that weekend. through practice and indeed through early qualifying he looked like the faster driver!', ""I feel like everyone forgets the completely new suspension design they brought in Austria.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVh4oKqxtJo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVh4oKqxtJo)

I believe higly competitive people such as sportsmen and women should be able to push the limits but where should the line be drawn? Drivers like Senna and Schumacher were always tough on track and wouldn't think twice about blocking etc but then again we have drivers like Prost who always used their competitive nature off the track even to the point of corruption to get what they want out of people.

On a side note, I was a young Mansell fan at that time and so didn't really care for either Prost or Senna but I have since grown to appreciate both for various reasons like their diffent driving styles.","[""This was 100% deliberate and Prost's actions were completely overshadowed by the FIA finding a way to disqualify Senna after he continued.\n\n\nThe line Prost takes is absolutely comical."", ""I've never seen this angle before.

As for the DQ, the rules were you could not get a push start. Both stalled, that should have been it. Senna got a push start. That’s what the DQ should have been for.

Even Murray and Hunt were saying that Senna will be DQed for a push start.', 'No one is fully right or wrong in the collision, but then again no one got penalised for the collision.', 'None of them would do that corner properly. Senna lunged by the inside and would hardly do the chicane, Prost broke early and was blocking Senna, knowing there was a high chance of Senna going for the open space.', ""> Everyone in the paddock knew that Prost crashed on purpose.\n\nThis isn't really true. I've read a ton of media from the period, and while the possibility that Prost turned in to crash deliberately was considered, most seemed to consider it a racing incident. [In fact some experienced racers (Jackie Stewart and James Hunt most notably, though Hunt later reversed his opinion) initially declared Senna to be at fault. Mario Andretti meanwhile seemed to think it a racing incident where both drivers did exactly what he would have done in their positions](https://postimg.cc/tZCjPJ58). (EDIT: This is a clipping from a 1989 issue of Autosport, just for clarity.)\n\n> Senna's move was just a typical Suzuka move. He never lost control of his car or anything.\n\nIt was from a long way back, but it was fair game yeah. As Andretti states in the clipping above, he had to try. That said, Andretti also endorsed Prost slamming the door, so it's swings and roundabouts to some extent.\n\nMy take on it is that Prost just did exactly what he said he would do pre-race. I've never seen any actual proof of him saying that he intended to deliberately take Senna out, but what he did say is that he was tired of having to leave the door open when Senna tried marginal moves on him while Senna didn't do the same in return. I think he therefore chose to slam the door incredibly aggressively, and did not care what happened. The collision was the result, so it was definitely much more on Prost that Senna, but I honestly don't think it was a cynical attempt to deliberately take him out (after all, if that's your goal why pick the slowest corner on the track where any damage has a higher chance of being recoverable?)""]",0,19,0.38,0,65,65,0,0,-0.020000000000000018,0

When that does likely happen, it will be pretty historic that ends of run of dominance by Red Bull and Mercedes. 

Norris/Lando would break the F1 WDC record of longest conscience wins by the same two constructors. A Red Bull or Mercedes driver has won last the 14 WDC among Sebastian Vettel, Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg, and Max Verstappen. It also inches McLaren closer to tying Ferrari’s F1 leading 15 WDC by a constructor. 

The next closest run was from 1984-1993 when McLaren and Williams won 10 straight WDC with Niki Lauda, Alain Prost, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna, and Nigel Mansell

It will stop another record from being broken as Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton are tied for the longest WDC consecutive streak of the same 2 drivers at 7 years. This is tied with Juan Manuel Fangio and Alberto Ascari also winning 7 straight years from 1951-1957

Maybe it’s because McLaren has had the fastest car on the grid for about a season and a half now, but this will truly mark an end of dominate era of F1. Feels like it’s not as big of a deal, but it truly is. Redbull and Mercedes have dominated the hybrid era (and the final stages of the V8 era) with so many changes over the last 14 years including the cost cap, ground effect being reintroduced, the mandating of the halo cockpit, the ever increasing size of the F1 car, DRS system, banning in-race refueling, etc.  Jensen Button’s winning car from 2009 looks so different and operated in such a different environment from the McLaren that will be on display likely soon. 

Obviously there is a chance that this is just a blip and Red Bull and Mercedes nail the 2026 regulations and Max Vertstappen still does indeed exist. Does just go to show how remarkable Red Bull and Mercedes run is given all the changes and still staying dominant and even the streak Verstappen and Hamilton have been on.

I think I’m really going to try and enjoy the last few races of the season because this is shaping up to be a historic season as I outlined and it could mark the end of an era. Does McLaren start a new era like Schumacher did to Williams and McLaren or will this just be a blip in the record books of a small win that’s overshadowed by more dominance from Red Bull and Mercedes?","['When was the last time a customer team won the WDC?
