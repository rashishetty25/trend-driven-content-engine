1oj7xzm,"Mistakes not 'Crashgate' cost Massa title, court hears",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oj7xzm/mistakes_not_crashgate_cost_massa_title_court/,2025-10-29, News,,"['>\xa0Massa\'s case rests on an interview Ecclestone gave to F1 Insider in 2023, in which he said he and then FIA president Max Mosley knew Piquet\'s crash was done on purpose but took no action in an attempt to ""protect the sport and save it from a huge scandal"".\n\n\n>Quest said Ecclestone, who turned 95 on Tuesday, ""does not remember giving this interview"".\n\n\nI knew Ecclestone would do this and frankly I think it’s a winning strategy. He is well known for talking shit.\xa0', ""Even if Bernie knew at the time, he was 'only' the promotor. The question is if Max Mosely (FIA president) and Charlie Whiting (Race director) knew about it / chose not to take action. As both have passed away, we will never know. I will be very surprised if Massa gets the compensation he is seeking."", 'Well...that is certainly a way to look at it. If I dropped 10 points on a mistake and then another 10 points on ""crashgate"" then lost the title by 7 points...I certainly would feel like crashgate cost me the title.\n\nYou can\'t just pick and choose which events could or could not have taken place to make up those 7 points. If crash gate doesn\'t happen, does Massa win? That is the only question that matters really.', 'Massa will not get a title. They won’t take it away from Hamilton. That is not the point. \n\nThe point is to get compensation on the lost bonuses and revenue of having been a world champion. \n\nI think it’s a fair claim. And I would take my chances on this lawsuit if I had the grounds for it.', 'Let’s be very honest about this: was anyone truly thinking Massa was gonna be crowned 2008 champion? Because I think anyone with half a brain saw that he was only doing this for compensation, which he might not even get. All Massa has accomplished in the last two years since he announced he was taking this to court was waste everyone’s time, including himself.\xa0\n\nYes, the crash was planned by Renault and Briatore, but it wasn’t Renault or Briatore who fucked up his pit stop that night. It wasn’t Renault or Briatore who spun 100 times at Silverstone. It wasn’t Renault or Briatore who spun out from a comfortable podium position in Malaysia. It wasn’t Renault or Briatore who spun out on the first lap in Australia.', ""Well, in theory both did\n\nTbf, massa and Ferrari aren't the only ones to have made made mistakes during the year, Hamilton also dropped points"", 'The comical thing about all this is Massa choosing to ignore the bullshit penalty that Hamilton got in Spa that year and also the drive through penalty he got away with for an unsafe release in Valencia.', ""Honestly, filing a claim that he wss stripped of the title because Piquet Jr crashed is so ridiculous. Has he even watched that race? After the pit boom failed, he was useless. Kimi was behind him during The Stop, and he made it up to 4th before crashing himself. Massa just plonked around at the back.\n\nIt honestly doesn't matter what Bernie said, this whole thing is absurd at minimum.\n\nWhy should the FIA void the race because of yet another Ferrari blunder?\n\nI'm not a lawyer, but I would then question every team orders episode, as it's effectively the same thing."", 'Obviously yes. He drove off with his fuel hose still attached that race.\n\nMassa must be broke as it makes no sense to chase this so much', ""Exactly. The reason he lost the title was because his team didn't disconnect the fuel hose, not because of crashgate. If he'd had a normal pit stop in that race he'd have finished in the points and won the world championship. What caused the safety car that made him pit is irrelevant.\n\nAnd also, why would they cancel the results of the entire race because Renault cheated? Surely the correct action would be to disqualify Renault which wouldn't affect Massa's points at all, in fact that would give Hamilton 2 extra points.""]",1672,311,0.97,1672,5909,5909,28,4,0.0,28

He earned that favoritism to some extent.
