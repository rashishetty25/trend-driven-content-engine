A new underbody is supposed to give the SF-25 a boost. The drivers hope it\'s pointing in the right direction, but doubt it\'ll be enough for McLaren.**\n\n> The unrest in Maranello was hushed up. Not a word about the fact that team principal Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur and his engineers were being scrutinized, as was rumored in two Italian media outlets before the Canadian GP. Ferrari wants to answer all the doubters on the racetrack. Therefore, the aerodynamic upgrade planned for Silverstone was brought forward by one race to the Austrian GP (June 29).\n\n> The new underbody is intended to help open up the narrow window within which the Ferrari operates. This problem has been troubling Ferrari engineers since the beginning of the season. An initial underbody upgrade in Bahrain brought only minimal improvement. The Ferrari SF-25 remains a car that is difficult to drive at the limit, especially in qualifying.\n\n> According to Charles Leclerc, the third underbody version gives cause for cautious optimism: ""It\'s a significant step. Will it be enough for McLaren? I don\'t think so, because the gap is too big. Several small steps will be necessary."" Lewis Hamilton also expressed caution: ""I don\'t know the exact figures for how much more downforce the new underbody is supposed to provide. We hope it\'s heading in the right direction.""\n\n> **Qualifying weakness at Ferrari.**\nThe next development stage of the Ferrari is scheduled to take place before the summer break, possibly at Spa. This is the mechanical part of the rescue operation. A new rear axle is intended to keep the car\'s ride height more stable within the window where the aerodynamics work.\n\n> The goal is to make better use of the tires in qualifying without having to sacrifice careful tire management in the race. Better starting positions would make things easier for Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton on Sunday. ""It\'s easier for us to manage the tires than to drive at the limit with little fuel. We lose too much time there because we rarely manage to get the tires into their window quickly enough,"" explained Leclerc.\n\n> **Criticism of 2026 cars.**\nWhile the eight-time GP winner is hoping that the second half of the season will be better than the first, he has nothing good to say about the 2026 car. Leclerc has already driven it on the simulator. ""To be honest, it wasn\'t much fun. But we\'re still in the early stages of development.""\n\n> The loss of driving pleasure is more due to the long recuperation phases than to the reduced downforce of the 2026 cars.

Currently sat in a hot taxi feeling super gutted. We were supposed to go to Maranello tomorrow on the literal trip of a lifetime from NZ which has cost us $8000 to arrange.  Our flight has been canceled so now we can't go and my friend is GUTTED.

We happen to be going to Silverstone on Fri Sat next week. Does anyone know of there's any way I can get pit lane access or anything for her? I want to do something nice to make up for this.

Thank you","[""I don't know if I fully understand your question but yeah there are VIP packages that you can purchase."", 'Why not talk to airline and get a different flight arranged? Should be other flights to close by cities or connecting flights? Not sure how a paddock pass to a completely different race help you? You still need to reach there, right?

They might even throw some small upgrades your way to make up for it.', 'You can pay a lot of ¬£¬£¬£¬£ for the hospitality but pit lane ??

This carries a bigger two-point penalty in the grand prix but the suggestion is an automatic one point if you do it in qualifying. \n\nUnless Verstappen hits serious misfortune on Sunday or Red Bull has its worst performance deficit of 2025 he shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about this one: drivers should be given one or two penalty points for failing to respect blue flags, depending on the severity of the infringement, alongside either a time penalty or a drive-through. \n\nThe punishments for exceeding the minimum time set behind the safety car and virtual safety cars are clearly set out. Post two or three red sectors under either, and you‚Äôll be given one penalty point. Post more, and you can be given up to four. \n\nVerstappen picked up a penalty point for breaching the minimum time behind a virtual safety car in the Brazil sprint race last year. \n\nIf you exceed the virtual safety car minimum delta time at the end of the virtual safety car that should result in an automatic issuing of a penalty point. \n\nIf an unsafe release from a pitstop is deemed to be the fault of a driver, the two options listed are one or two penalty points, depending on the severity of the incident.', ""I can't wait until some of the points expire so that journos can finally move on from this topic."", 'Oh great another one about his penalty points.', 'Next weekend they should make an article on what he needs to do to pick up 3 penalty points, and so on every time his tally changes\n\nClassic the race beating a dead horse for the 50th time, it‚Äôs been almost a month since Spain ffs, we get it, he is very close to a race ban', ""Last year's incident is typically one that should never result in penalty points.
