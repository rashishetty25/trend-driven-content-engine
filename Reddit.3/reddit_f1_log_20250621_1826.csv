Many believe that the new contract could already be announced at Silverstone. Or is Max Verstappen still an issue after all?*\n\nNot much will happen on the transfer market for 2026. Most of the drivers have a valid contract for the coming season. Max Verstappen too. And yet the world champion stimulates the imagination of observers: Verstappen can leave Red Bull in a certain constellation. And at Mercedes, there is a vacancy on paper.\n\nGeorge Russell\'s contract expires at the end of the year. So far, there have only been non-binding oaths of loyalty from both sides. Team boss Toto Wolff says that Russell has been part of the family for a long time, and that even without the recent successes, his qualities as a driver are known. Russell insists that he is only talking to Mercedes. He explained to all other interested parties that his stay in the Silver Arrows team was a priority.\n\nAnd yet Wolff and Russell are asked questions about the current water level every weekend. And because there is no definitive ""yes"" word yet, every reaction, every word, every action of those involved is weighed on the gold scales and interpreted. It is noticeable that Wolff avoids any criticism of Verstappen and builds a bridge to the Dutchman even in controversial scenes such as in Barcelona. Analogously, Red Bull team boss Christian Horner praises Russell for his performances conspicuously often. You just don\'t mess up with drivers you might need for some reason.\n\n**Russell: ""Why change anything?""**\n\nHowever, there is much more to suggest that Mercedes and Russell will continue their marriage and that they will take their time until the British GP in Silverstone to report completion. In Montreal, Wolff explained: ""There is no update on George. He\'s a member of our family, and he\'s performing. We never doubted him. He has the speed, the winning mentality, the work ethic. We don\'t need wins or pole positions to confirm his qualities. Everything is developing as it should."" Which could be interpreted as a continuation of the cooperation.\n\nRussell also downplays the urgency of negotiations: ""We are in no hurry to negotiate. We want to win together.
