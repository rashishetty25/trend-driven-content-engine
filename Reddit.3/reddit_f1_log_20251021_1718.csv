Russell is at risk of being eliminated next race in Mexico, if Piastri outscores him by 22 points. This would require Piastri to win and Russell to finish 9th or below.

I've added a new calculation: the best and worst possible finishing position. Interestingly, despite being 5th and 6th in the standings, the best Leclerc could finish is 2nd, while Hamilton could only manage 4th. Piastri is guaranteed to finish 4th or better, thus ensuring that he will at least tie his best finishing position (4th, in 2024). With 141 points remaining, there is considerable potential for movement towards the back of the grid, with 15 drivers being able to finish anywhere in the final 15 positions.

**WCC:** There was no change in the WCC this week, but the battle for 2nd is getting tighter, with Red Bull scoring more points than Ferrari, who scored more points than Mercedes. There is considerable potential for movement between these team next week in Mexico:

* Mercedes will retain 2nd provided they don't lose more than 7 points to Ferrari and 9 points to Red Bull
* Ferrari will retake 2nd if they outscore Mercedes by 8 points and don't lose more than 2 points to Red Bull
* Red Bull will take 2nd if they outscore Mercedes by 10 points and Ferrari by 3

There are two clear groups of teams forming: Mercedes to Red Bull, with possible finishing positions between 2nd and 5th; and Racing Bulls and below, with possible finishing positions between 5th and 10th. Williams is alone in the middle, with the possibility of finishing anywhere between 2nd and 10th.",[],1,0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1.0,1

1oc47x9,Wonder what other hardcore fans (you) think would be positive changes to the race weekend format,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oc47x9/wonder_what_other_hardcore_fans_you_think_would/,2025-10-21, Discussion,"Background: I have watched every formula 1 qualifying and race (I think) since early 90's (was then a pre-teen/teen) and I love it (love motorsport in general). However, everything can always be better ... these are my realistic thoughts (mostly realistic in any case...) to improve the show. What do you think?

1. Points system should be expanded maybe down to 15th. Easy and a total no-brainer IMO. Would give the backmarkers more to race for.
2. Sprint race qualification. Nice enough with more racing / show, but right now its a carbon copy of the race and IMO thats a missed opportunity. Some say reverse grid. I'm not really for that. Instead I would bring back the one lap shootout for qualifying. That would bring enough randomness into the game (track conditions, track evolution). Order = championship position, let the leader go first.
3. Sprint race. This is harder reg. the setup ... but I think it should be doable in our time and computer age: many tracks has different configurations. Change it between sprint and race, so that the sprint has a different configuration. I know sectors will have to be changed for timing. And track will have to be modified, maybe with some paint and curbes worst case scenario. But think that would bring something extra.
4. Would love to see an extra race between the formula 1 drivers - maybe on none-sprint-weekends? - in equal machinery. Could be sponsored locally per event: In germany GT4 porsches, in US some Chevy stock car etc. etc. Expensive and difficult to do maybe ... but think it would create a huge interest. Here qualifying could be an oldfashioned 1 hour test session (to let the drivers learn the machinery) and the grid determined by the sessions order.

What do you think? And do you have other good, realistic ideas?","[""Regarding Sprint Quali - they should do single lap Qualification imo, even if it's just for the Q3 runners.

I know F1 is trying to come up with new ways to bring in more fans and Lee more fans interested. F1 has a unique team and constructor element to its sport that you don’t see in American racing series. F1 is always rumored to be going in the direction of more sprints and more short action events to not lose the attention of fans, they think the only way to gain new viewers is to be able to make a race short enough to post on TikTok, Reels, & YouTube Shorts. But I think biggest complaint is often the lack of action, especially for 1st place. So what if instead of adding races to calendar and/or adding sprints what if a few weekends out of the year they did a tag team “endurance” style race.

You could still do qualifying a similar way. 
Session 1, each team picks a number 1 driver to do a Quali run.
Session 2 the number 2s go out, then session 3, is the best driver from each team in Q1 and q2 go out again for final q3 starting grid. 
Then race day you pick which driver to start and  they drive a full race or maybe only 2/3-3/4. And you still require 1 mandatory pit for each driver, then when they finish their full race instead of crossing finish on last lap, they enter pit lane and 2nd driver leaves their garage once pit crew gets the first car jacked up and wheeled into the garage. Then the 2nd driver goes out and does their 50+ laps through the finish line. Nobody gets individual points just team points maybe only for top 5 or top 7 teams. And if you want to add individual element, you could pair it with a sprint weekend to score individual points

1obylse,Piastri chances are still strong - I built a Python Monte Carlo F1 Simulator to predict the WDC,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1obylse/piastri_chances_are_still_strong_i_built_a_python/,2025-10-21, Statistics,"With the title fight tightening up after the US GP (Piastri P5, Verstappen P1), I got tired of guessing, so I built a Python-based Monte Carlo simulation to project the final Drivers' Championship outcome.

How real are Verstappen's chances? 

  
1. Track-Specific Performance Weights (Adjustable)

I created a custom system that applies a performance multiplier (a weight) to each driver for the specific characteristics of the remaining tracks (Mexico, Brazil, Vegas, Qatar, Abu Dhabi).

* **Example:** Verstappen gets a `+20% likelihood boost` for Mexico City's high-altitude/high-downforce circuit. This addresses the fact that some cars simply perform better on specific layouts.

# 2. Deterministic ""What If"" Analysis

The script automatically runs a hard-math check to see what happens if Verstappen wins out. Which outside of 2023 - is pretty unlikely even given his current form.

Right now even if Max wins out and Piastri gets 2nd, Piastri takes the championship. 

`--- Deterministic 'What If' Analysis ---`  
`SCENARIO: If VER wins EVERY remaining race/sprint:`  
   `PIA CAN still win the WDC.`  
   `PIA Max Points (if 2nd every time): 450`  
   `VER Guaranteed Points: 447`  
`-------------------------------------------`



The chances for winning a race are the big question. You can run the script and change them. The reality is Max needs a good run + some bad luck from McLaren. 

With these default weights:   
  
`--- World Drivers' Championship Simulation Results (Track-Adjusted) ---`  
`Total Simulations Run: 10,000`  
  
`--- Championship Win Probability ---`  
`Driver | WDC Chance`  
`------ | ----------`  
`PIA    | 74.33%`  
`NOR    | 25.57%`  
`VER    | 0.10%`

  
It does not take a DNF into account - although there is a chance the driver does not score. 

You can play with code and change the weights here:
