1mk12l0,People who's favourite driver retired/lost his seat did you stopped watching it or started supporting someone else or just what happened ? Can you tell what happened afterwards,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mk12l0/people_whos_favourite_driver_retiredlost_his_seat/,2025-08-07, Discussion,"I haven't get this feeling yet since Max is still racing and will continue to race in 2026. So I'm gonna tell my friends experience to give some more context.  A friend of mine is a very big Seb fan and while Seb was still racing if he had a free time he used to watch every practice session spending some time in F1 related communities in social media etc. He was die-hard fan. 

Anyways when he retired my friend was obviously sad, also he gradually quit F1 like first he just started to watch Quali and Race also stopped spending time in f1 communities afterwards he only started to watch races and nowadays he usually just looks up to race results and watches some races if they're promising to be exciting (Silverstone this year for example) 

So what happend to you it'd be nice to hear other people's experience too

I did something similiar to what your friend did when Roger Federer retired, but I wasn\'t a fan of tennis, I was a fan of Roger\n\nI think the only way to know the answer is by asking yourself ""am I watching this because I love racing and this category or am I just watching because of Max""? Your favorite driver quitting doesn\'t necessarily mean you\'ll lose interest in the sport.\n\nedit: typos', ""I suggest trying to get attached to some other drivers now. Does one of the promising rookies catch your attention? My husband's favorite has been George since we started watching in 2021, but as time has gone on, he's added Oscar and now Bortoleto (picked up when watching F2 last year) to his list.\n\nIf your fandom is tied pretty exclusively to one driver, you might lose interest when Max retires. But, if your enjoyment is tied to the larger sport, you'll probably keep enjoying the sport. Also, you can move from being one type of fan to the other."", ""I've always had a number of favourite drivers and I have a favourite team.\xa0\nI was very sad when Jenson retired, but you move on. Having a favourite driver is fun, but not necessary.

There's always room for another favourite!\xa0\nI can't imagine stopping watching the sport, but there have definitely been years in the past that I've not watched as much.\xa0"", ""As a Mexican, I've had it both ways. I used to follow F1 since the early 2000s (as in read about it and watch some highlights on TV), and started watching some races around 2008-09 I think. Then Checo joined F1 in 2011 and that made me incredibly excited, so I started following it much more and watching qualys and races more often (sometimes it was too early in Mexico so after a night out I missed those). A turning point was Liberty Media taking over and making it much, much easier to watch F1, so by that point I very rarely missed a race. Checo then joined Red Bull and of course the excitement went through the roof. The last two years were rough though, I didn't want to watch the qualy anymore and just focus on the races, as it was honestly very hard to ignore his downfall. This year has been different, I still watch every race but much more stress-free. I support Charles (always have) but now I enjoy the season differently. I'm 100% sure I'll keep watching for many, many years."", 'As a Yuki fan I’ll probably root for the next closest Japanese driver to F1 if he loses his seat.

I follow Albon now, guy just seems like a great dude and we love a redemption arc. But even now I dont follow as closely as I did from 2007 onwards. A big part is finally having enough with awful race direction though. But damn i miss my guy.\n\nWhy did i get insta downvoted lmao', ""Being such a fan of one driver that you'd consider stopping watching when they retire is quite a weird concept for me.
