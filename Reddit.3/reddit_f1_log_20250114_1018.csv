1i0hqd2,What are some races where an unlikely car/driver almost won the race but said possibility was forgotten by the general public?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i0hqd2/what_are_some_races_where_an_unlikely_cardriver/,2025-01-13, Discussion,"F1 isn't a stranger to unlikely race winners nor the unlikely cars/drivers that ""almost"" won a race. Most recently, Esteban Ocon in last year's Sao Paulo GP took advantage of the red flag and led until the 2nd safety car restart where Max Verstappen overtook him en route to a famous victory. 

However, I recently rewatched the 2012 Italian GP, a race most famous for Lewis Hamilton's final pole-to-win with McLaren and Fernando Alonso's podium extending his championship lead to 37 points, including 39 points over Sebastian Vettel who retired in the closing stages. What also stood out was Sergio Perez, who ran an off-set strategy by starting on the hards, finished 2nd and just 4.4 seconds off the lead despite starting from 12th and had a great chance at challenging for the win if he qualified well enough (his teammate Kamui Kobayashi qualified and started from 8th).

This drive by Perez in Monza is certainly much less remembered than Perez's drive in Malaysia the same season where in changing conditions he rapidly closed down on Fernando Alonso, cutting the lead to 0.5 seconds and eventually finishing a memorable 2nd place, with just 2.3 seconds off the lead.

So like this, what are some races where an unlikely car/driver almost won the race but said possibility was forgotten by the general public?

He was a bit overshadowed by his teammate for that race - a certain young chap called Michael Schumacher - but after Schumacher retired he drove a very strong race and was closing on leader Ayrton Senna when his engine blew due to a lack of lubricant.\n\nBruno Giacomelli also almost won for Alfa Romeo at the 1980 US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

Remember to keep it civil and welcoming! Gatekeeping within the Daily Discussion will subject users to disciplinary action.

Third is Fernando Alonso.\n\nI know Bianchi was against Chilton, but that stood out to me. Going back further, it’s Salo and then Schumacher. Bianchi is clearly up there under ‘Salo’ circumstances.', 'Monza 2019 Q3 is the best thing I’ve ever seen.  \n\n\nWait…wait….wait…..oh damn.  We’re late!', 'If, purely hypothetically, an F1 car has 200 hp at the front and 900 hp at the rear, does the character of an RWD remain, or is it completely gone?', 'Plenty of the of the character would remain if there were no fancy control systems managing the power split - that\'s heavily rear wheel biased, so the front wheels are really just giving a small amount of ""free"" lap time in the traction zones.\n\nOf course, as soon as you introduce power to the front wheels you will lose some of the character and introduce a slightly new driving feeling, that\'s unavoidable. It\'s unlikely anyone other than somebody driving the car would actually be able to tell though.\n\nOne of the big advantages of AWD with a hybrid PU is front axle regeneration, so the other question is whether a 200hp front motor would actually be beneficial enough to justify the extra weight and complexity.', 'It seems so exciting to me because you largely retain the character of an RWD, but with the advantages and energy recovery of an AWD. Wouldn’t this also mean that less fuel would need to be carried onboard? Personally, I think this is a better alternative than burning fuel to charge the battery (I’m referring to the regulations starting in 2026).\n\nMaybe it’s not relevant just yet, but I do believe that in the longer term (5-10 years), they will be able to make such an electric motor compact and powerful enough, especially for use in F1.', "">Maybe it’s not relevant just yet, but I do believe that in the longer term (5-10 years), they will be able to make such an electric motor compact and powerful enough, especially for use in F1\n\nYou could 100% do it now, Formula E already has a 250kW motor on the front axle in a car that's smaller than an F1 car (weight is a potential sticking point, however). The idea was even discussed as part of the 2026 PU regulations at an early stage.\n\nThe questions about car character will always remain though as F1 is generally very conservative and the idea of moving away from RWD, even in a way that's not hugely noticeable, will be a big hurdle to clear.""]",1,7,0.67,1,6,6,0,5,0.0,0
