1i36lmy,How is Jack Doohan STILL managed by Flavio Briatore?!,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i36lmy/how_is_jack_doohan_still_managed_by_flavio/,2025-01-17, Discussion,"After reading into this‚Ä¶holy conflict of interest Batman, and why on earth would he continue to have Flavio as his manager?!

Jack Doohan is managed by Flavio Briatore. The same Flavio who‚Äôs both;

- Executive Director of the team he‚Äôs on
- Seems to be quite actively sabotaging his own clients career in favour of Franco.  

As someone in talent management, this isn‚Äôt just ‚Äòan account‚Äô, someone is putting their passion and livelihood in your hands to maximize their career potential and earnings. Flavio being Jack‚Äôs manager makes sense‚Ä¶until he went to Alpine. 

Toto Wolff manage(d) Esteban Ocon and Valterri Bottas. When there was conflict of interest with them being a part of Mercedes F1, Toto separated himself from the conflict of interest to other reps to keep church vs state, until it came to external negotiations (that scene in DTS where Toto‚Äôs on the phone with Cyril). 

Once Flavio joined Alpine, immediately Flavio should‚Äôve enacted the same. Taking on a role at Alpine would also be his priority, also arguably a reason to look elsewhere for representation if I were Team Jack. But, for some reason‚Ä¶this never happened. 

With the news that Alpine actually scooped up Franco‚Ä¶ya‚Äôll know he‚Äôll be in that seat sometime in 2025‚Ä¶Flavio, still being his manager is f‚Äôing shocking. 

- His own manager is actively working against his own client, to put in someone else into the team! Beyond the talent of Franco, I‚Äôll take a wager Flavio sees a profit share from extra sponsors Franco brings in, and to add value to Alpine in advance of selling to increase the value of his own payout. 

- If you were Jack, on top of all this, how can you confide and speak openly with your ‚Äòmanager‚Äô when he‚Äôs also at the top of the team and absolutely could (and probably would) use that information against you to further the argument to drop him for Franco.


What am I missing here? How the hell could Jack still be managed by Flavio, what a VERY scummy thing for Flavio to set up for Jack‚Ä¶

How is this not being covered more by F1 news?! 
  ","['He picked Flavio as his manager to begin with‚Ä¶ despite his well documented past of shenanigans. Maybe jack believes that without him he would have no chance at all - and maybe he is right about that. \n\nOnly a hand full of people know the truth and they aren‚Äôt writing articles about it.', '>How is this not being covered more by F1 news?!\n\nBecause it is nothing new?\n\nFlavio was the team manager of Benetton, bought Ligier solely to get their Renault-engines to Benetton, then did a deal with Mugen-Honda so they would breach their contract with Minardi, so Ligier got the Mugen-engines, sold 50% to Tom Walkinshaw (who he had hired as an engineering director for Benetton previously). Sued Minardi, Minardi counter-sued. He settled with Minardi, paying off Minardis debt to Briatore and the Mugen-breach.   \nNow, you may wonder what debts Minardi had to Briatore? Well, in addition to running Benetton, buying Ligier etc. he also handled customer deals with old Ford engines, a deal that Minardi had signed for 1993, but not getting what they were promised. So they made an own deal with Ford/Cosworth themselves for 94, and not paying Briatore.  \nAnyway, while still running Benetton and having finished off the Ligier, Mugen-Honda, Minardi issues, he then bought shares of the Minardi team(!). Trying to then sell it off to British American Tobacco, but failed (BAT would later buy Tyrrell and enter as BAR in 1999). He then sold his share back to Minardi and Gabriele Rumi again. The following year Benetton decided to replace Briatore with David Richards (yes, the Prodrive, Subaru World Rally Team man).\n\nThis didn\'t stop Briatore from being involved in F1 though. He and Bruno Michel (that is GP2, F2 Bruno Michel) set up SuperTec, who started to supply the 1997 Renault F1 engines that Mecachrome still assembled, after Mecachrome had done the supply themselves in 1998. When Renault decided to return to F1 in 2001 (still running under the Benetton name), they also bought out SuperTec from Briatore and appointing Briatore as a team principal for the team.  \nAt the same time, Briatore had started to get heavily in to managing drivers, and while he by many is accredited with ""finding"" Fernando Alonso, he bought out Alonsos 5 year contract with Minardi, and ending up placing Alonso to race for Minardi in 2001.  \nThe next few years he would manage Mark Webber, Jarno Trulli, Nelson Piquet jr, Heikki Kovalainen and others. Possibly the strangest way he handled that was firing Jarno Trulli while being his manager. The double-dipping is also one of the reasons Piquet jr did what he did.\n\nSo... Briatore being Doohans manager while also having his role at Alpine is extremely mild and neutral in Briatore-terms...\n\nFun thing though according to one of the co-managers for Colapinto, some of Colapintos sponsors will stay at Williams, and the deal is a 5 year loan(!?!)', "">Jack Doohan is managed by Flavio Briatore. The same Flavio who‚Äôs both; Executive Director of the team he‚Äôs on Seems to be quite actively sabotaging his own clients career in favour of Franco.\n\nNon of this is new. Flavio was also manager and Team Principal for Alonso, Heikki, Piquet jr, and Trulli. The only one of those 4 whose career he seemed to give a damn about was Alonso.\n\n>what a VERY scummy thing for Flavio to set up for Jack‚Ä¶\n\nSurely Jack has responsibility for his own decisions?

It can help for sure, but it‚Äôs more of an easy fix rather than the ultimate fix.\n\nA flexing front wing won‚Äôt magically fix fundamental car issues either. Mercedes remained inconsistent even after their FW upgrade at Monaco.\n\nIf you get the balance right, a smaller non-flexing front is better and more predictable for the driver. The restricted nature of these regulations probably means you can‚Äôt achieve that perfect balance that way though. As rivals caught up, RedBull probably needs to let go now.\n\nFerrari brought flexing wings of their own, but it was their floor upgrade that actually fixed their car. Even then, on unfavourable tracks it still trailed McLaren.\n\nIf RedBull goes for a flexing front wing it will be because it helps to improve car performance on medium-low speed corners with minimal drag penalty.\n\nHowever, if they haven‚Äôt fixed the base platform problems, the flexing front wing won‚Äôt magically bring them back to dominance and they will occasionally struggle again.', ""Am I remembering wrong or didn't Ferrari leave their slump before introducing flexi wings?"", '>**""We had some other aspect of the car which allowed us to rebalance the car,""** admitted Wache.

The original rumor, before all the asymmetric braking stuff, was that the FIA made them get rid of a ""complicated suspension setup."" \n\nI honestly don\'t know what to make of those claims. My intuition tells me there is something to all these Red Bull rumors but none of the teams when asked by reporters have indicated that Red Bull were doing anything. BUT, then again, if they were and the knowledge of it was coming from Rob Marshall, then the other teams might have no clue and it wouldn\'t be in McLaren\'s interest to go spilling the beans about it because it also makes their performance jump in Miami look not as impressive (and RBR is hardly going to come out and say the FIA nerfed them because it would imply they were cheating, likely for the previous 2 years, as well).', '*The Race hates only one thing and its fucking amazing*', 'I thought they were going to be allowed to use their variable braking valve.', ""It's a rite of passage at this point..."", 'Ferrari broke their car with a faulty floor and then replaced it so that they became good again.
