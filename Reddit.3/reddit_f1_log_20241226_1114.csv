But it’s not about reactions – which is the physical asset which most obviously begins to decline with age.\n\n>We know this because there have been many tests done of F1 driver reactions – and the outcome is completely normal; a range from fast to slow, just as in any control group of non-racing drivers. One of the greatest racing drivers of all time, Michael Schumacher, had notoriously poor reactions when measured.\n\n>“About the same as mine,” related his then-boss Ross Brawn. Dr. Ricardo Ceccarelli, whose Formula Medicine establishment has worked with a high proportion of the F1 grid of the last three decades, has conducted this test as a matter of routine. He says: “The range is completely normal from fast to slow reactions with the group. My secretary actually had one of the best scores.”\n\n>It's not about reactions, it’s about feel. Reactions measure the response time of our central nervous system to a stimulus. Research conducted by defence contractor (and one-time Williams sponsor) QinetiQ to determine physical suitability of candidates for fighter pilot roles found that sensitivity to rotation and yaw (the very things a racing driver is using to feel and balance a car through a corner) came from receptors in our lower spine which pass messages sub-consciously (and therefore instantly, with zero delay) to our middle ear.\n\n>This would seem to suggest that the effectiveness of this neural pathway is what actually differentiates who can feel a car better than someone else and probably therefore how naturally quick they are.\n\nShame the people who only read headlines and smugly make conclusions will likely miss out on it."", ""This is a really great article. As always Mark is one of the few writers who can explain how a driver like Lewis can find lap time, and link that to why the current cars don't work for him. \n\nThe section about the medical tests for reaction time is fascinating. You only have to look at Alonso's performance to see that age won't be a factor for Lewis."", ""I always felt the mark of a great driver is their adaptability.\n\nHamilton has driven in F1 since 2007? That's 18 years by now of competition, regulation changes and team changes and he has been mighty competitive in almost all those years\n\nPerhaps his relative decline is really more a function of age and/or motivation since 2021.
