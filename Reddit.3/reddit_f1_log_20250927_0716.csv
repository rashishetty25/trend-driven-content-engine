You'd save a lot of tyres, you'd end up with a more mixed up grid and the track promoters can still have three days of meaningful action.\n\nI prefer the flow of a Sprint weekend than a traditional one (lack of long runs going into a race being a main factor), but at the same time I have to say that the Sprint race itself is utterly pointless.
