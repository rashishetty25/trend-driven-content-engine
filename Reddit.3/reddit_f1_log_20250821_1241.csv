According to reports in the German press, the Argentine will not be staying on at Enstone in 2026, with Sergio Pérez and Valtteri Bottas being named as the main alternatives. However, the list of potential replacements does not seem to be very long.\n\nColapinto joined Alpine on loan from Williams at the start of the year. He began the season as a reserve driver and, after six races, replaced Jack Doohan at Imola.\n\nHowever, the Colapinto who impressed when he first arrived in Formula 1 with Williams is not the same driver we have seen at Alpine so far. It is true that the car has not helped him; he has had to contend with one of the least competitive machines on the grid. It should also be noted that he did not participate in pre-season testing or the first six races of the year.\n\nAlpine have expressed dissatisfaction with Colapinto's performance from Imola to Hungary, prompting them to reconsider the Argentine's future with the team. According to the German website AMuS, Franco is in serious danger of losing his seat for 2026.\n\nThe publication states that Colapinto's time at Alpine will end at the end of the season, but he still has ten races left to change the team's mind. They don't have many alternatives, and the names of Pérez and Bottas have been mentioned again.\n\nIn Bottas' case, the Dutch press reported yesterday that he had signed with Cadillac to return to Formula 1 in 2026, meaning he would not be an option. Pérez is also well positioned to drive for the American firm, although there is currently no agreement in place.\n\nThis could make him a real option for Alpine to replace Colapinto, although the French team does not seem to have many alternatives. They have Paul Aron, their current reserve driver, but he would be a similar gamble to the Argentine driver. According to the test times at Monza in March, Franco was consistently faster than Aron.\n\nWith just a week to go until the return of Formula 1, the Silly Season is heating up once again after Max Verstappen confirmed that he will be staying at Red Bull until 2026. What remains to be decided are perhaps the less competitive seats on the grid.
