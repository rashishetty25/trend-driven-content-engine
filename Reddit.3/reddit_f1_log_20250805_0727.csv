McLaren are so far ahead it doesn’t matter.\xa0', 'I mean he was 2 tenths behind Charles when he went out of Q2. Charles himself was on the cusp and admitted that getting out of Q1 and Q2 was a struggle and that by the time Q3 came around it was a very different track… \n\nAnd his average deficit to Charles in qualy is only 0.146 seconds this year. One of, if not the fastest guy on the grid over one lap in a team and car he’s very familiar with, half way into a season with a new car and importantly very different braking characteristics. \n\nIf Perez last year had been 0.146 on average behind Max, can you imagine all the good things people would have been saying about him? The short memories and double standards of people ignoring facts to suit their narrative is ridiculous. \n\nGiven that this regulation set massively reduced the effect of one of the main things that gave Lewis the edge regarding raw speed most of his career so far….. Is he actually doing that badly?\n\nI don’t think Lewis helps the narrative that so many people want to spin with interviews like the last few days but it also points to his headspace and still for him being 0.146 off Leclerc isn’t good enough.', 'One off season?', ""Can you imagine if Charles said 'oh he's rubbish. I'm just way better than him. I would have beaten Rosberg as well. And Verstappen in 2021. Its all down here for lewis from here.'\n\nHe can't really say anything else.

It might not be the wild race we are expecting from a sly fox like him, but it is the race he needed to maximise the points that he could for the weekend\n\nStroll, as well put in some really fine laps during qualifying.

The situation that has played out yesterday was incredibly reminiscent to Spa 2024, where the driver with nothing to lose, given the circumstances of his race up until that point, chooses to go onto a lesser-suggested strategy and manages to make it work. What is believed to be the better strategy eventually did not unravel in the way that is expected. Stuff like that happens in Formula One, similarly to the weight of luck in races and well-timed strategies. It happens. And some folks should be open into accepting that it is a thing, rather than drum up baseless conspiracy theories of their own. \n\nFor the record, this race was a blast to watch for myself. Both of them had me on the edge of my seat as they maximised their points and took home the good haul to set up a fantastic final stretch for the season between their fight. I have seen some folks moan about the fact that there was no clear dominance this season between the two because *""they should be, in the fastest car""* yet in the same breath, condemn dominance streaks of guys like Verstappen and Hamilton in their prime. The sports discourse demonstrated throughout the course of this season will never fail to stun me for how cheap and off-putting things have gotten.', ""I think the accusation slinging of Mclaren favouring one driver over another is getting very silly. Been at it all season, but especially the last two races have been ridiculous. F1 Twitter never saw the days of Multi 21, or even the Rosberg-Hamilton gamesmanship of 2016. The fight between Norris and Piastri has been very clean so far and entertaining to watch, to want your fav to just run away with it and replicate Max Verstappen's 2023 title shows you're not interested in a healthy sport and competition and you're just in it for the tribalism."", 'Who would have thought that a simple rear axle can make the diverence between almost losing to the Williams and being in Podium contention. \n\nHappy to See George getting another Podium and to See Antonelli being relieved about finally scoring points. \n\nThe Astons/saubers are absolutely in the Right for 5th in the constructors Right know. \n\nFerrari maybe where able to finally break Hamilton completely and I would be not surprised if Leclerc leaves at the end of the Next year, if they cant get their Shit together. \n\nAnd finally who would have thought that the best way of closing the gap between Max and yuki is just to make the car a real midfielder?']",54,296,0.91,54,2588,2588,6,2,0.010000000000000009,6

1mhyrn9,How do this season's constructors compare now that we're half way through?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mhyrn9/how_do_this_seasons_constructors_compare_now_that/,2025-08-05, Discussion,"Obviously McLaren have the best car this year, but it seems so hard to judge outside of that. The Aston Martin seemed like a tractor and then suddenly had both in the top 7. The Red Bull appears to (have) been capable of winning races for the first third of the season, while the second car can't get inside the top 15. The Merc also seemed competitive for the first third of the season.

The RB has been consistently able to be just inside the top 10 with three different drivers. The Sauber is a tractor that both of its driver's have been able to drive into the top 6. The Ferrari seems all over the show, the only vehicle that seems consistently shit is the Alpine, but even then Gasly has had it inside the top 10 a few times. 

So, given all that, how are we ranking them? I guess taking an average across the first half of the season I'd say:

1. McLaren 

2. Mercedes? This felt like an easy pick up until the last three races

3. Ferrari? Again, so all-over the place that it's hard to assess this car

4. Red Bull - It has been competitive at times in the hands of a generational talent, but worst on the grid while Yuki/LL have been piloting

5. Aston Martin - Stroll has been in and out of the points all season in the AM, and lately Alonso has been accumulating even more points than Stroll in it. Hungary in particular it was strong

6. Racing Bull - Doesn't have the pace to compete at the top, but is reliable and has been consistently in the 8-12 placings

7. Williams? - Has shown the ability to have pace, but has also been inconsistent despite having two very good drivers

8. Sauber? - Everyone labels it a tractor, but it has been on the podium and has scored points under both drivers

9. Haas - Seems harsh as it has scored points under both drivers hands too

10. Alpine - Gasly has regularly taken it into the points, but both second drivers have struggled to drive it out of the bottom quarter.

  
What are your feelings/rankings so far, I'm interested to see and have something to talk about while I wait for the Netherlands :)","['Tie between Mercedes and Ferrari as there have been races where one has been clearly better than the other.\n\nAnd I would order the middle and lower class of the grid like this: Williams, Aston Martin, Sauber, Haas, Racing Bulls & Alpine', ""I personally believe that a car is only as good as its fastest driver. With that in mind, here’s how I’d rank the teams based on overall pace in the first half of the season:\n\nMcLaren – No notes. \n\nMercedes – It’s been pretty tight between them and Red Bull. They’ve both taken turns being the second or third fastest team, occasionally slipping to fourth if Ferrari shows up. But on average, I’d give Merc the edge.\n\nRed Bull – Pretty much the same story as Merc. I know there’s probably a case for putting them fourth and I get that. I think that argument mainly comes from the gap between Max and Yuki. But like I said earlier, I’m judging based on what the car is capable of, so I’m giving weight to the fastest driver.\n\nFerrari – Similar vibes. Flashes of performance, but just not consistent enough to crack the top three. They've been better in the last couple of races though. So, that could very well change.\n\nWilliams – Reliability’s been a pain, but in terms of raw pace, I think they’ve been ahead of the rest below them.\n\nRacing Bulls – Quietly solid. They've been around the points more often than not, and haven’t had the wild ups and downs that Haas or Sauber have.\n\nAston Martin – They started the season off terribly, but they’ve finally begun to find some form. Curious to see if they keep climbing.\n\nHaas – Bit of a toss-up between them and Sauber, could go either way.\n\nSauber – They’re picking up lately, which is nice to see. Could easily jump a spot or two if they keep it up.\n\nAlpine – Yeah... no comment."", 'Consistently, RB over Aston Martin', 'All teams are very close together overall, especially compared to the past. \n\nWhen it was normal that we saw some cars lapped multiple times and most cars lapped at least once, tier list of the constructors was easy. \n\nNow we have a double situation:\n\nAll teams are relatively close together, we have qualifyings where almost all cars are within 1s during Q1. And we super sensitive tyres that change their performance with just a change of the ambient temperature by few degrees kelvin. \n\nSuddenly Mercedes is the fastest car in Canada, only to go for a spell of mediocre results for Russell and terrible results for Antonelli. Suddenly the Williams finds itself nowhere, only to be somewhere the next race. The drives to P19 and starts from the pitlane only to start P5 next race. \n\nIn the past these up and downs of 0.5s of lap time due to a fitting track did make you jump like 2 or 4 positions maximum. Now you jump halve the field. Hitting the tyres gives you another 0.5s compared to teams that miss it. \n\nMy current order is: McLaren, Ferrari, Mercedes, Red Bull, racing bulls, sauber, Williams, Aston, Haas and Alpine. \n\nThe order 10 races ago might be quite different. With Aston even worse, Williams P5, Sauber worse and a change between Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull', 'The only certains things are Mclaren will finish P1 and Alpine P10 (only team with no upgrades since Barcelona and no upgrades scheduled for the rest of the season, 100% focusing on 2026).', 'As we\'ve seen several times this season, these cars are one upgrade from gaining or dropping several places in the pecking order.

The field is so tight this year and it\'s hard to know which teams will swing which way, which is part of why this season is great. 1st is wrapped up. There\'s pretty much a 2-way battle for 2nd with 4th almost guaranteed.
