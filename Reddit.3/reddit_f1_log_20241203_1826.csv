1h5b012,Sergio Perez should not be remembered for the past two years. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h5b012/sergio_perez_should_not_be_remembered_for_the/,2024-12-03, Discussion,"
Yes, I know it‚Äôs extremely more easy to dunk on Sergio Perez right now, I‚Äôve been extremely guilty of that. The last two seasons (2023 and 2024) have been quite honestly, beyond awful.  But I think people are forgetting just how good Perez was in the midfield for almost a decade before joining Red Bull.

From his debut in 2011 with Sauber, it was clear Checo had talent beyond the normal pay driver. Who can forget his incredible drive to 2nd place in Malaysia 2012, almost beating Fernando Alonso in a vastly inferior car? Or his podiums that season in Canada and Monza? That year put him on the radar of the entire paddock and got him a seat at McLaren in 2013‚Äîa team that, unfortunately, was on the decline.

But after McLaren, he rebuilt his career at Force India/Racing Point, becoming the king of tire management. Perez consistently punched above his weight, dragging those midfield cars to results they had no business achieving. Baku 2016 was absolutely brilliant in my opinion. 

But his victory in Sakhir 2020 was a masterclass in perseverance‚Äîfalling to the back of the grid after an early collision and still winning the race. That win alone cemented his place as one of the most reliable and clever midfield drivers of the 21st century so far.

It‚Äôs sad to see how his time at Red Bull has overshadowed all of that.. But let‚Äôs not forget the Sergio Perez who kept the likes of Force India alive, paid the team members salaries when they went into administration, was renowned for saving tires that not many others could do (Portugal 2021) , and who delivered consistent results year after year when it mattered most.

It feels like people only remember the bad moments and have erased the years of brilliance he brought to F1‚Äôs midfield. Checo deserved his chances in a top team, even if in the end, it hasn‚Äôt worked out the way anyone hoped.

Whatever happens from here, I‚Äôll always respect Sergio Perez for what he achieved before Red Bull. He was the midfield driver of the 2010s, and that‚Äôs a legacy worth remembering.","['Checo and Hulk will always be the two absolute best midfield drivers of the past decade. They were brilliant together at Force India.', ""That's why his decline is so egregiously disappointing to me, really - I remember watching those early seasons at Sauber and thinking he had serious potential, definite race winner and maybe even a WDC. I thought the McLaren move was a season too soon though, he needed another year in the midfield before stepping into the pressure of a major team, and unfortunately not only was that true (in my view at least) but he joined them at the absolute worst possible time.\n\nIf you'd told me back then he'd end up at Red Bull I would've expected it to mean he was fighting for the title, and indeed early '22 it looked like he might have been, even in these recent years he kept a bit of a reputation for his brilliance around street circuits, it just makes it all the more dismal how far he's fallen, and how fast. We talk about drivers falling off the performance cliff but rarely has that cliff been so apparent, and it's largely because he came from very respectable heights."", 'He shouldn‚Äôt be, you‚Äôre correct but it will take a few years for the cream of his career to rise to the top in the fan bases memory', 'It‚Äôs a bit sad really because I don‚Äôt think you can blame an F1 driver for hanging on for as long as they can. It‚Äôs what they dedicate so much of their time and energy to do and I can‚Äôt imagine it is very easy to say, ‚ÄúI am clearly not as good as I used to be so I will leave now,‚Äù instead of them thinking, ‚ÄòI just need to get back in form, there‚Äôs still a chance to win, next year could be different,‚Äô etc. I bet for the bulk of them (as in, drivers who retire after a run of poor form), even when they aren‚Äôt enjoying themselves as much because of the constant poor performances and the endless criticism, they probably still love the sport and would not be able to easily come to terms with the fact that their last win is already behind them.', 'Most of us here know exactly how good Perez is when he\'s at his best. I mean, he didn\'t get the Red Bull seat in the first place because he was slinging it with the backmarkers. Many fans, myself included, were ecstatic when Checo got the seat a few years back because the dude was getting Force India/Racing Point into places it didn\'t belong.\n\nThe problem, however, is precisely that: when he\'s at his best, something he hasn\'t been for a *good* while now.\n\nAnd it has nothing to do with Max, at least not anymore. He\'s fallen into a slump that was partly justified earlier this year when Red Bull just...completely fell off a cliff. At that point it was like ""Oh, so this is what he\'s been dealing with? Max has just been...Alonso\'ing this turd into positions it probably doesn\'t belong in.""\n\nThen, Max continues to etch out performance after performance and Sergio is getting outqualified by Lance fucking Stroll.\n\nNah. \n\nYou have to remember the good and the bad, and unfortunately Sergio is firmly in the ""bad"" phase right now. Does it overshadow his prior performances? I\'d say absolutely not, but it has, at least in my opinion (which counts for naught in the grand scheme of things, let\'s be honest) certainly stained his legacy.', 'I still remember Perez doing some giant killing in 2012 in that sauber. Funnily enough he was not a good qualifier even back then, he‚Äôd qualify behind kobayashi just outside the top 10 which allowed him to do some weird one stop shit which worked more times than it should have and netted him some crazy podiums.', 'Maybe he should have left last year. \n\nI hate to say it...but he will be remembered for the last two years. His time at Sauber and Force India were brilliant. He was good enough for McLaren at one point. When they were still expected to be good. \n\nBut the theatrics of this year has just soured his legacy so bad.', ""I do agree, but when an athlete's decline drags on and on, and they don't retire, it's hard to not remember them for that. If Checo loses his seat and doesn't get another seat, that isn't him retiring because he knows it's time, it's because no one wanted to hire him. Checo would like to keep driving longer and has said that. He signed a two year contract extension that hasn't even started yet, and I believe he's indicated that he wanted to keep driving after that. At some point, the declining years are a significant portion of his legacy."", 'But his performances also shouldn‚Äôt be forgotten, he had his time and now it‚Äôs over, it happens, he was a solid driver at certain times']",7640,766,0.87,7640,15025,15025,148,14,0.0,148

During the Qatari Grand Prix we spoke with Pierre Wache, the technical director behind the car of Max Verstappen. Last year the Frenchman was praised, this year he received a lot of criticism because Red Bull Racing suddenly had a dominant car during the 2024.

He won a number of races in 2016, but in 2021 came the title until 2021, which shows how difficult it is,‚Äù said Wache, who would like to clarify that after all these years in Formula 1 he still realizes how unique it is to win in the premier class of motorsport.\n\n>‚ÄúEvery good thing has to be right to win in Formula 1, everything has to be well tuned to make it possible. You also have to be a bit lucky and you also have to have a good police performance, haha (Wache refers to the stewards as being police, ed.).

The difference between the technical regulations and the sporting regulations is that with the technical regulations you have to prove that you are doing it according to the rules. With the sporting regulations it is the other way around. It is the reverse of, for example, a speed measurement by the police, where they can only estimate your speed at one point, but do not see the rest. With the technical regulations you have to show that you are fits well, because everything visible.""\n\n>*However, isn\'t the gray area also part of the game?*\n\n>""Yes, of course it\'s part of the game, but at the same time there are limits.

It was a premature end to the relationship between the Enstone team and the Frenchman, who contested his final Grand Prix at Losail on Sunday. Although he had only just retired, the rumour was circulating before it was confirmed and then made official: Jack Doohan will take his place from next weekend at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the final race of the 2024 season.\n\nAccording to sources close to the team, everything happened very quickly, just a few hours before the start of the Qatar Grand Prix, when Flavio Briatore called Esteban Ocon into his office. The Alpine chief advisor told him that he would not release him for the season-ending test with Haas unless he gave up his seat early.\n\nHowever, the director of the Frenchman's future team, Ayao Komatsu, had already indicated at Interlagos that an agreement had been reached. However, Alpine never officially confirmed the news, postponing it until Esteban Ocon was presented with the conditions, he would have to accept to ratify it.\n\nWith preparations already underway for those tests, which will take place at Yas Marina next week following the final Grand Prix of the season, the Frenchman decided not to give up, even if it meant missing out on a proper farewell to Alpine, as was a priori planned for the final race of the championship.\n\nEsteban Ocon, for example, had planned to wear a special helmet at this final Grand Prix in honour of the team whose colours he has defended for the past five years. In the end, however, his relationship with the team ended abruptly in Losail on Sunday, in the very first corner, after a collision with Franco Colapinto that he could do nothing about.\n\nEsteban Ocon's early departure means that Alpine will be able to give Jack Doohan his racing debut before next season, against a backdrop of speculation that Flavio Briatore is genuinely interested in Franco Colapinto.\n\nWe know that the Australian rookie was evaluated in more detail a few weeks ago during a test session to which Pierre Gasly was invited to establish a benchmark. Sources in the paddock suggest that he was close to the times set by the Frenchman, who will be the natural leader of the Alpine in 2025.\n\n**‚ÄúThis is not the way I wanted it to end.‚Äù**\n\nThis evening, Esteban Ocon gave his first reaction to the issue, writing on social networks:\n\n>*First of all, I would like to thank the mechanics and engineers working on all the functions at the circuit, at Enstone and at Viry-Ch√¢tillon who have raced alongside me over the last five seasons. We have shared so much together, and I am proud to call many of you, my friends.*\n\n>*I leave Alpine/Renault with great memories and the pride of having been the driver with the team's best results since returning to the sport, taking the top two podium places in Bahrain, Hungary, and Brazil. It was also an honour to contribute to fourth place in the constructors' championship in 2022. I know how much all those moments meant to everyone and it is that sense of achievement and joy alongside the team that I take with me.*\n\n>*It has not been an easy year for the team and the second half of the season was particularly difficult. For various reasons. I have absolutely no regrets, because I gave 100% in every session. As I have always done.*\n\n>*To the hundreds of hard-working men and women at Enstone and Viry, I apologise for not being able to come and see you in person and bid you a proper farewell. As you know, the plan has always been to race one last time this weekend and to say goodbye to you personally next week. I was looking forward to both. It is not the way I wanted things to end. That said, it is a small world in F1 and I am sure I will see many of you again soon.*\n\n>*I'd also like to wish my friend Jack every success as he takes the next step in his career at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix this week.*\n\n  \nPD: Thanks u/RumBlaze to share it in the comments in the previous post about Ocon IG post."", 'If I were Doohan at this point of time, I would be both excited for the opportunity but also scared of the future with this team', 'Just heartbreaking. Finding out only hours before the Qatar GP that he was going to be leaving after the race and not being able to finish the season out with Alpine if he wanted to participate in post-season testing with Haas. Cherry on top was not even being able to complete a lap at the race since he crashed at turn one of lap one.', ""The fact he didn't even get to finish a lap in Qatar, by no mistake of his own, knowing it was his last race with them... ffs."", 'This is pretty typical Briatore bullshit.', 'Man I dislike Ocon as much as the other guy but he definitely deserved a proper goodbye. Fuck Alpine.', 'Things definitely went sour with alpine. They‚Äôve been trying to get rid of him since Monoco, so I‚Äôm not suprised that this was the conclusion of everything.', ""I do think it's odd we don't see more of this, generally speaking. Driver is going elsewhere, team finds it beneficial to continue paying them while their replacement, if available, steps in for the final few races.\n\nThat said, Alpine as always has a way about doing things in the oddest and often worst ways possible.""]",42,26,0.92,42,24,24,42,26,0.92,42

# The Formation Lap

Gather ‚Äòround racing friend, for the latest batch of team updates, driver buzz, technical adventures, and trackside stats is ready and waiting for you‚Ä¶

[*Throttle & Tread‚Äôs*](https://throttleandtread.substack.com/) fifteenth edition of *Last Week in Formula 1* has arrived.

Before leaving the garage, [you can catch up on last week‚Äôs issue here.](https://throttleandtread.substack.com/p/last-week-in-formula-1-november-18-2024)

In the perfection-seeking spirit of F1, *Last Week in Formula 1* and *Throttle & Tread* are in a constant state of development. So any feedback you have on what‚Äôs covered, the format, or anything I missed is welcome in the comments.

And if you, like me, enjoy pretty things‚Ä¶

Now let‚Äôs get down to business‚Ä¶

\~\~\~

# The Qatar Grand Prix



***Sprint Qualifying / Sprint Race:***

P1. Lando Norris / Oscar Piastri

P2. George Russell / Lando Norris

P3. Oscar Piastri / George Russell



**Qualifying / Grand Prix:**

P1. George Russell / Max Verstappen

P2. Max Verstappen / Charles Leclerc

P3. Lando Norris / Oscar Piastri



***Throttle & Tread‚Äôs Reaction:***

When you remove the order-jumbling facilitated by the FIA‚Äôs exceptionally poor handling of Albon‚Äôs discharged mirror into T1 (which could have been swiftly dealt with in a lap or two by a VSC) and the sudden resurgence of drive-through penalties, not much went on in this race. However, who doesn't love a little chaos, albeit controversial? Especially when the end result brings some stakes to Abu Dhabi.

***Personal highlights from Lusail include:***

* Zhou‚Äôs‚Äîand Sauberaudi‚Äôs‚Äîfirst points of the year!
* Valterri Bottas elevating himself from 23rd in the WDC
* Pierre Gasly continuing his strong run of form with a solid P5
* Ferrari keeping their WDC hopes alive (with a little help from Lando)
* Lewis‚Äôs absolute rollercoaster of a race: *He dropped 4 positions at the start, picked up a 5 second penalty, asked if the car was broken, got a puncture, pitted, received a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane, pitted, asked to retire, was told to stay out‚Äîthen told to retire, decided to stay out this time, then closed a 12 second gap, gained 3 positions, and finished in P12.*

\~\~\~

# The Drivers‚Äô Mutterings & Musings

*Welp, I can‚Äôt say I expected this heap of driver rumblings and rumours to hit the airwaves in Qatar:*

Desire for Young Gun Franco Colapinto has been cooled by his recent run of crashes‚Äîmeaning [his shot at a seat in the Red Bull stable is gooone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4plvs/thomas_maher_franco_colapinto_is_off_the_table/)¬†

So assuming there‚Äôs truth to the growing number of [reports that Checo will be let go and/or offered an ambassadorship role](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4uhiz/perez_red_bull_exit_likely_after_abu_dhabi_f1/) a la Danny Ric once the checkered flag waves in Abu Dhabi, Liam or Yuki will get the ride in 2025.

[Estie Besteban Ocon‚Äôs 2024 season came to an unexpected and premature end](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4raqi/alpine_goodbye_esteban_ocon/) in Qatar, [as a condition for him being able to test with his new team‚ÄîHaas‚Äîafter Abu Dhabi.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4bhsq/the_race_ocon_had_to_give_up_final_alpine_race_to/) In his place, [Jack Doohan will make his debut.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4qvmd/alpine_team_statement_jack_doohan_will_race_at/)

And *maybe now* we‚Äôll get an end to the hopeful ‚ÄòMick Schumacher returns to the F1 grid‚Äô articles, [given he‚Äôs chosen to leave his Mercedes role at year's end.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1uhjk/mercedes_amg_f1_we_can_confirm_that_mick/)

Speaking of reserve drivers, [Alpine has signed F2 rookie Paul Aron as their 2025 reserve](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h38p21/bwt_alpine_formula_one_team_paul_aron_signs_as/)‚Äîstepping in for Jack Doohan who is graduating to a race seat.

*However, Jacky D might be holding his breath,* [*as there have been rumours over the past couple weeks that Franco Colapinto could scoop that seat out from under him‚Ä¶*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h3awow/thomas_maher_the_rumours_of_colapinto_switching/) *Which would be absolutely gut wrenching. We‚Äôll see!*

Departing Formula 1 for the second time, everyone‚Äôs favourite viking, [Kevin Magnussesn, seems set to join the BMW M Team WRT in WEC next year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h3algi/enduranceinfo_wec_kevin_magnussen_on_course_to/)

\~\~\~

# The Teams‚Äô Twistings & Turnings

***The F1 grid‚Äôs most recent addition:***

As they‚Äôve asserted all along, ~~Andretti-~~Cadillac‚Äôs preparation for joining the grid in 2026 continues at pace, [with their latest hiring of former Renault engine tech chief, Rob White.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gznb3i/autosport_andretti_lands_former_renault_f1_engine/) But that‚Äôs not even close to all on the matter‚Ä¶

Thanks to some curious combination of Michael Andretti stepping back from the day-to-day operations, potential legal pressure applied by an American DOJ antitrust investigation, and ‚ÄúAndretti‚Äù¬† being dropped from the name‚Ä¶

The General Motors-supported [Cadillac F1 Team *will* join the grid in 2026.](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/gm-cadillac-2026-f1-team-andretti-absent/)

[So far we know that:](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h0ajxt/mario_andretti_reveals_his_plans_for_americas_new/)¬†

1. Their ideal driver lineup consists of a ‚Äúyoung American talent‚Äù (with Colton Herta being the top candidate) and an F1 veteran ([Bottas?](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1yi0n/cadillac_f1_interest_2025_indycar_offer_bottas/)). 
2. The Andretti Global organization is building the chassis and running the race team, with GM being responsible for leading the engine side.  
3. Until said GM engine is ready for 2028, there‚Äôs an interim engine deal with Ferrari in the works for 2026 and 2027.

*Now roll up your sleeves for a few more dashes of drama‚Ä¶*

***Audi‚Äîa project in trouble before rubber meets tarmac:***

Thanks to being blue-balled for years and years‚Ä¶ The F1 fandom at large remains skeptical that Audi will follow through on joining F1, at least until they show up on the grid. And making moves like selling 1/3 of the team to the Qatar Investment Authority won‚Äôt help. However, arrangements like these aren‚Äôt unusual in Formula 1‚Äî*At the very least* Mercedes, Renault, McLaren, Aston Martin, and Cadillac don‚Äôt have full ownership of their teams either.

[More concerning than a partial sale are the rumours that their 2026 engine is behind schedule and they‚Äôre having trouble attracting skilled personnel‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h08try/audi_sells_a_third_of_its_formula_1_team/)

***Hot bananas, the FIA is a roaring dumpster fire right now:***

In yet *another* firing, Race Steward Tim Mayer [warns that the FIA is running out of people to fulfill their responsibilities](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1wax6/andrew_benson_fired_steward_warns_fia_is_running/)‚Äîalso sharing that he was fired because Doodyhead Sulayem was offended by a right of review document.

Further bringing shame upon the FIA and their frustrating leader, Janette Tan‚Äîpromoted to F2 Race Director just one week or so ago to take over for Rui Marques who was elevated to the F1 role‚Äî[has been let go before she could direct even a single race, with Marques now directing both series.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h1uc7o/fresh_fia_upheaval_as_f2_race_director_janette/)

If you want all the details, my hopefully future friends at The Race penned [this article](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/fia-embarrassing-crisis-deepens-ahead-of-f1-qatar-gp/) catching up on ‚Äòthe FIA‚Äôs embarrassing internal crisis.‚Äô

Unfortunately, MBS‚Äôs shenanigans have continued by [removing two top level FIA bankers from office for questioning him on where money was going‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h2gnoo/top_duo_removed_from_office_after_querying_fia/)

More questions of the FIA‚Äôs competency piled up in Qatar after the poor handling of Albon‚Äôs dismembered mirror was left on track, hit and exploded into smithereens by Valterri Bottas, likely contributing to two punctures‚Ä¶

While there‚Äôs no argument about Lando, Lewis, etc deserving penalties for their infractions, the sudden doling out of stop-and-go and drive-through penalties has left teams and drivers frustrated at the lack of consistency.

*Plus* good ‚Äòol [Doodyhead Sulayem thinks that how he runs the FIA is none of the drivers‚Äô business‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h43xey/ben_sulayem_tells_f1_drivers_how_he_runs_fia_is/) Which seems an awfully silly take to this observer.

In closing, [Toto Wolff thinks the FIA could have its own reality show.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h4qtun/wolff_fia_could_have_its_own_reality_show_amid/)
