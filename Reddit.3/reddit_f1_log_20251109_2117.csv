This year hasn't been great, but it's not the absolute worst season of Ferrari. They had worse ones. For example, 2020, when they had the worst result since 40 years. They had worse one in 2014, when alonso had to drive the most unstable car in f1 that had unique ability to understeer and oversteer at the same time. 

I just watched brazilian GP after another double DNF, but it's not like Ferrari is fighting for anything. Their real last chance is gonna be in Las Vegas. 

But there have definitely been a lot more painful moments for Ferrari team than today's race or double dsq in China. 

Like the image from Singapore 2017 or Vettel's crash in Germany 2018 or Leclerc's engine failures in 2022 alongside his crash in France that destroyed his chances for title.

1osgskk,I looked at 800 overtakes from the last 30+ years at Interlagos. Here’s where you actually want to sit,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1osgskk/i_looked_at_800_overtakes_from_the_last_30_years/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"I’ve always heard people say the Senna S is the best place to watch the Brazilian GP, but I wanted to know if that’s actually true. So I went through data from the past 30+ years (roughly 1990–2023) and looked at around **800 on-track overtakes** at Interlagos to see where the action really happens.

**Main Straight / Start–Finish, Best overall**  
About half of all overtakes happen here. The long DRS zone and slipstreaming make it the busiest part of the circuit, and you see cars pull out to pass right in front of you. Plus you get the start, pit stops, and podium. **Grandstand A** is the go-to spot if you want overtakes and atmosphere in one.

**Turn 1 (Senna S), Pure action**  
Roughly a quarter of the overtakes happen here. Cars come flying down the straight and dive under braking. It’s chaotic on lap 1 and great throughout the race.  
**Grandstand M** sits right at the end of the straight with a perfect view into the Senna S, while **Grandstand B** is slightly further back but still sees the braking zone and the start of the corner.

**Turn 4 (Descida do Lago), Underrated gem**  
Around 10 % of the overtakes happen here. It’s the second DRS zone, downhill, and you often get side-by-side moves that carry through the corner. **Grandstand G** looks straight down the hill and gives a great sense of speed.

**Best spot**  
If you combine the main straight and Turn 1, you’re looking at roughly **80 % of all overtakes** over the past three decades, which matches what most F1 analysis sites say about Interlagos’ two DRS braking zones being where nearly everything happens.

**Turn-by-Turn Ranking (top 8)**

| Rank | Location       | Total Overtakes | % of Total | Avg/Race |
|------|----------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| 1    | Main Straight  | 471             | 53.2%      | 14.7     |
| 2    | Turn 1         | 227             | 25.6%      | 7.1      |
| 3    | Turn 4         | 80              | 9.0%       | 2.5      |
| 4    | Turn 2         | 24              | 2.7%       | 0.8      |
| 5    | Turn 6         | 19              | 2.1%       | 0.6      |
| 6    | Turn 3         | 13              | 1.5%       | 0.4      |
| 7    | Turn 10        | 10              | 1.1%       | 0.3      |
| 8    | Turn 12        | 9               | 1.0%       | 0.3      |

**TL;DR:**

* **Main Straight (Grandstand A)** – best all-round experience and most overtakes (~50% of overtakes)
* **Turn 1 (Grandstand M or B)** – most dramatic corner action (~25% of overtakes)
* **Turn 4 (Grandstand G)** – cheaper and still plenty going on (~9% of overtakes)

If you can get a seat that shows both the straight and the Senna S, you’ll catch almost all the overtakes live.

Max Verstappen  is trailing behind with 5. Lando is leading when it comes to podiums at 17(20 including sprint podiums) with Oscar at 14(17) and max at 12(15) respectively. George Russell is now the ONLY driver in the top 10 to have NO DNFs. He shares this with lance stroll who also has no race DNFs😱 sadly George Russell is now OUT OF CONTENTION for the WDC.","['People really not appreciating Landos season overall. 17 podiums aint a joke', 'Max was a beast today!!!', 'Lando wdc is only a formality now. A great talent and well deserved after sticking with mclaren through some dark times', ""Read this nice little breakdown and once again ask myself why it is people think Lando's been shit"", ""Stroll having no dnf's really hurts the stroll storylines lmao"", 'Imagine being the type of fan who looks at these stats and honestly believes that Norris doesn’t deserve or has been gifted the WDC.', 'Since you did the math op what will it take for max to win wdc in terms of position for both lando and max in the remaining 3 races. I dont wanna know about oscar since he is crumbling hard under pressure and also what he did to leclerc', 'Those damage limitation p2s till Monaco are definitely helping right now', 'Beginning of season was not that great. His drives after Baku were great and really showing that he can be clinical in a fast car.', 'Insane drive from Verstappen. I honestly thought he wasn’t even going to make it to points. Never count max out!']",89,24,0.86,89,21,21,89,24,0.86,89
