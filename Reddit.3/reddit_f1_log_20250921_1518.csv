Still, Yuki is either more experienced *or* was rated initially as having a higher ceiling than all of the past decade of drivers for the lead team that never managed a win. (I.e., Rookie and early-career Yuki seemed stronger than Kvyat when accounting for proneness to dumb incidents, and Gasly, Albon, and Lawson never had a real shot). Additionally, the car itself is rarely ever the clear fastest or even challenging for it over a weekend, with Max as an incredible confounding factor in rating performance. Nevertheless, a driver able to consistently stay 2-3 positions behind Max would have them a clear second in the championship, which is better than most years of the team's history. \n\nThe Racing Bulls sit at 7th in the constructors' championship, in the midst of a very tight 6-8 and abnormally close 5-9 when the whole field is incredibly tight. Two mediocre drivers could fly completely under the radar if they only occasionally made it into Q3 as long as they weren't under constant threat of Q1 exits. However, Hadjar has had incredible qualifying form, having made only one Q1 exit and taking 16 races to do so. Lawson bounced back to have strong mid-season form after falling short of optimistic expectations in his shock promotion to Red Bull. \n\nGiven that AlphaTauri finished 7th and 6th in 2020 and 2021 when Gasly was paired respectively with Kvyat and Tsunoda, and Toro Rosso recorded sixth-place finishes in 2008 with the Sebs and 2019 while primarily driven to the points by Gasly and Kvyat--all more experienced pairings than the current duo--I think there's a strong case to be made that Lawson and especially Hadjar are proving to be some of the strongest young drivers the team has had. Now, measuring by peak qualifying result in a rain-affected session is deeply flawed, but this is just one of the many statistics that tell us how impressive the Kiwi and Frenchman are!"", 'If Albon wasn’t out in Q1 it could’ve been huge for former Red Bull drivers too', 'I’m starting to believe in these Horner sabotage conspiracy theories', ""C'mon, we all know how Yuki's race is going to be.\n\nHe's gonna do fine for the first part, keeping his position, maybe gaining one, and then, during the first pit, Red Bull will call him too late or too early, and maybe some satefy car shenanigans will happen while he is in pit, and he's gonna end up in 14th or something.\n\nC'mon, we've seen that happening all year."", 'Simply lovely']",2750,82,0.99,2750,3031,3031,12,1,0.0,12

1nm3x2k,What is up with the flag infractions this weekend?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nm3x2k/what_is_up_with_the_flag_infractions_this_weekend/,2025-09-20, Discussion,"Watching the training and qualifying and seeing all the infractions that get thrown around the flags, and when reading the official FIA documents i'm sitting here like, are you joking? 

""The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 27 (Nico Hulkenberg), team representative and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, telemetry, and in-car video evidence. Car 44 ran off at Turn 1. A yellow flag was waived at Turn 1 as Car 27 approached.  After the turn, Car 27 overtook Car 44, which was travelling at a significantly slower speed than Car 27, prior to the green light displayed between Turns 1 and 2.  This all occurred after the chequered flag had been displayed. The driver of Car 27 advised that he could not see the yellow flag because it was displayed after he began turning into the apex of Turn 1.  He then could not see the green panel because it was obstructed by Car 44 in front so he had no idea until he passed Car 44 that he was in a yellow flag area."" 

So are they supposed to come to an stop during a yellow flag now? Yes i know the flag rules no overtaking and so on, but it has always been a difference between overtaking an car that drives the same speed as you vs overtaking the one who caused the flag in the first place. And the same with the case from yesterday with Piastri, where there was a splitt second momentary yellow but he didn't slowed down while seeing the green light. 

What is the next thing they are going to drag drivers into the office for? Overtaking durin a red light because they drove past the striken car?
