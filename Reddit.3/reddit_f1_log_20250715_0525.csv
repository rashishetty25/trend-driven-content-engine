I don\'t expect you to fully get it, but at least try, please. It was celebrated, because we finally had our freedoms back... and western brands, which F1 most definitely is, played some part in it just as well.\n\nHeck, freaking western music was legally banned at the time. Only state allowed bands and musicians could sell their records there (and it was mostly shit, as you can imagine). All you could do is get some off the shelf contraband stuff that somebody copied in Germany and smuggled it here. That\'s how shit was back then, so when F1 had a race in this part of the world, it really meant a lot.\n\nDisclaimer, because I know that redditors tend to idealize communism here and there... I\'m not Hungarian (I\'m Czech) and I do not support their current government in any way. I am very liberal and they suck ass and can go fuck themselves. But try to read it through optics of a country that was oppressed for years by living behing the Iron Curtain and that had to answer to Moscow for everything, instead of looking at it through the lucky westerner optics of ""anything that celebrates fall of communism is automatically right wing in the Trumpish sense"" of ways. Communism in Europe after WW2 did a lot of terrible shit that many people shrug off as just poor implementation. And fair enough, maybe it could have been titled more as ""Did F1 play the same role as blue jeans and Coca-Cola in ending Soviet influence""?\n\nSeriously many of you don\'t realize how good you had it on the west side of IC. I appreciate that this article is written in English because I sure as hell don\'t speak Hungarian, but yeah... with that title... and seeing that it\'s on conservative site... it won\'t do well in front of people that were born on the better side of the world at the time.\n\nRidiculous title, but a good read.\n\nEDIT: Now that I read my comment again I get that it might come off a bit too agressive and I\'m sorry for that tone, but this matter is very sensitive to me and my family, so sorry about being a bit too brash about it. But I guess it just underlines the point I\'m trying to make. F1 didn\'t cause any political regime to fall, as clearly shown by present F1 racing in very sketchy countries to say the least. But as symbol, it really was a big deal to the common man, we had a taste and look at what people in the west watch and do for their entertainment after decades of listening to propaganda how you guys just eat rubbish and struggle every day (in contrast to our state is taking great care of course), and that\'s what the article is all about.', ""I think the Hungarian GP played a small part in it. Like the [heavy metal show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Music_Peace_Festival) in Moscow. \n\nThey were all small pieces of the same puzzle. People behind the Iron Curtain saw you can, in fact, have nice things. Rock 'n' Roll, freedom of speech, car racing, supermarkets, free press, entertainment, free trade, more than one political party, movies, heavy metal, titty magazines, WWF wrestling, David Hasselhoff, people doing stupid fun things just because they can, or even *gasp* starting up a business of their own. There was no single individual thing that broke the dam, but all the things together, combined with being dirt poor and suffering under communism."", 'That was actually a very well written and informative article, I’d recommend reading if you’ve got ten minutes', ""Of course they won't tell that Hungary was not the first option to become the organizer of F1 Grand Prix in the Second World."", 'Wasn’t there a Top Gear/the Grand Tour segment where they drove a car from the USSR version of F1? I feel like it was super janky but had some clever engineering. Will try to find it.']",0,35,0.31,0,309,309,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
