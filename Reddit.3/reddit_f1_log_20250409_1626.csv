At timestamp 0:25, Jolyon says that it's McLaren's decision whether they can set up their garage at the end of the pit lane or at the start, as they are the Constructors champions.

How does a team decide whether they need it at the start or the end of the pit lane?

What factors are taken into account to make this decision? (time lost during pits, the width of the pit straight, etc)

And there have been instances where a team has gone against the normal scenario (eg, a track which traditionally has Constructors from the pit lane start, decided to be at the pit lane end in a particular year)","[""Yes it's true. Red Bull would pretty much always choose the start of the pit lane when they were WCC, for example."", 'They might prefer an unobstructed exit from the box (end of the pit lane) or an unobstructed entrance to the pit box (beginning of the pit lane)', ""During the Japanese GP, Julien F√©breau, who is the main French commentator for Formula 1 on Canal+, said the order was determined not only by the previous year's WCC, but also depending on where the paddock entrance is."", 'From a tight race perspective, let‚Äôs say Max is 2.5 seconds ahead of Lewis.  He comes in to pit and Lewis follows at that same gap.  Maxs stop takes 2.6s, Lewis comes by and he is held up, however briefly by another car coming in to pit.  \n\nThere are even some circuits which have wider pit exits so you can go almost side by side to eliminate the possibility of having an unsafe release. \n\n\nAs such wouldn‚Äôt it always be better to be at the end of the pit exit?', 'Following is a comment I made in an a thread about three weeks ago:\n\nI couldn\'t find a good answer to how they choose garage order. This whole ""WCC team choosing garage"" thing seems like something that is repeated without any actual evidence ‚Äì and I\'ve just gone along with that without giving it any extra thought. I couldn\'t find anything specific in the rulebook either.\n\nBelow are two sources I found saying something about the order, though nothing about anyone\'s choice.\n\n>The position of each team‚Äôs garage in the pit lane is also determined by its finishing position in the previous season‚Äôs Constructors‚Äô Championship. The champions work out of the space nearest the pit lane entrance, running down the order to the team who finishes last, who have the garages nearest the pit exit.\n\nhttps://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/the-beginners-guide-to-the-f1-constructors-championship.66nTfWSqrUYv3bnbosPkHV\n\n>Garage positions in the pit lane are assigned based on the team finish order in the constructors\' championship from the previous season. Normally, the team with the most points gets the garage closest to pit entry, while the second-place team is next, and so on.\n\nhttps://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-news/1010929/f1-pit-stops/\n\nI went through [all the pit drawings from 2024](https://www.fia.com/documents/championships/fia-formula-one-world-championship-14/season/season-2024-2043) and most of them had Red Bull in the garages closest to pit entry.

Drivers queue up in the pitlane and create gaps between cars and you have to yield if you‚Äôre end of pitlane.

Seeing the teams create Japanese culture themed liveries, helmets, and promotional materials last week I realised I've seen virtually nothing of Tsunoda fandom from a Japanese perspective.  

I might be stereotyping here, but are there manga, anime, magazines, games, technology, food products, endorsements etc that we don't really see outside Japan?

I was a big fan of the Initial D series as it was being produced and there was a lot of hype around Keiichi Tsuchiya and the drift driving on hill climbs etc that seemed to produce a lot of fandom and commercial spin offs.  I'd imagine that there'd be something of that surrounding Yuki Tsunoda in Japan?

Please share anything in the comments!","[""In terms of mass media/sponsor stuff, every now and then there's some Red Bull promo here (like buy two cans, get a pin badge with Yuki's helmet/car on it), and I'll sometimes see someone wearing a VCARB cap, but that's about it in terms of seeing him in the wild here. I haven't seen him on any random endorsement ads or anything.  \nMaybe that'll change now he's in Red Bull, but I'd be surprised unless he sees some success there."", 'I am only speaking based on my experience in Japan over the last 3 weeks‚Ä¶\n\nBefore the Grand Prix, as I met and spoke with Japanese people in Tokyo they were largely unaware the Grand Prix was on, didn‚Äôt know Yuki but were like ‚Äúoh ya, car racing. That‚Äôs cool‚Äù. Couldn‚Äôt find merch or anything in Tokyo, but sugar free red bull has Yuki on it here.\n\nThen, when I went to the Grand Prix, I would say the overwhelming team support I saw was for Red Bull and Racing Bulls and almost even split between Max and Yuki. Some of the Yuki merch the fans were wearing was a few years old, so unlikely driven by the recent news. They were probably supporting throughout his career. Also, obviously, some really cool fan made outfits supporting Yuki. There was also a Yuki themed gachapon in one of the shops. But outside of that, just saw the type of merch you would see at any Grand Prix, I didn‚Äôt see anything uniquely different for Yuki. There was a nice photo ‚Äúalley‚Äù of his journey to F1 showing photos from when he first starting karting and then most of his Grand Prix starts.\n\nI spoke to some younger (than me) Japanese fans on the trains to and from (mostly early to mid twenties) and they were supporting Yuki this year and were fans of some of Hirakawa and Iwasa, but said they were larger fans of other drivers and before this year who would have supporting Ferrari or Aston Martin. \n\nI‚Äôm still in Japan for a couple more weeks, so if there are things I have missed, please let me know as I would LOVE to buy some Yuki merch whilst here, but compare to Melbourne, which I also attended, not close to same level of support Oscar had where he was voicing tram stops, the Grill‚Äôd dedicated burger/meal, murals, he was selling everything in all the OOH ads.', 'I was in Japan last year and Yuki did some kind of popup store, meet and greet thing.

1juilz6,Concept Convergence: The one thing that is not being brought up in the ‚Äúdifficult to overtake‚Äù conversations this season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1juilz6/concept_convergence_the_one_thing_that_is_not/,2025-04-08, Discussion,"In Adrian Newey‚Äôs 2017 autobiography, ‚ÄúHow to build a car‚Äù, Newey brings up how the 2016 grid was almost a monolith, and how the racing became less exciting because ‚Äúall cars looked the same‚Äù. He cites ‚Äúconcept convergence‚Äù as at times inevitable, but also a sign of a bad cycle of regulations. This has been the persistent problem of the post-2023 regs and why overtaking has been so difficult this season. The cars are the most identical they have been, and that‚Äôs a problem.

Some things that I noticed when browsing about discussions as to why the Japanese Grand Prix was a parade, is that people bring up the usual suspects of weight, dirty air by outwash, tyres lasting too long, and the cars just being too large in general. While dirty air will always be a contributor to bad racing, it is important to remember that the first half of 2022 had some of the best racing we‚Äôve ever seen, with cars being the same size they are now, and the heaviest they‚Äôve ever been (the 2022 cars are F1s all time heaviest cars), with tyres lasting much longer than they do now as well.

The reason why the first half of 2022 had exciting racing was plainly and simply, concept divergence. We had three functional concepts: The Red Bull downward sloping sidepod concept, the Merc ‚Äúzero-pod‚Äù or ‚Äúhide-pod‚Äù concept, and the Ferrari Bathtub concept. The Red Bull had great straight-line speed, the Ferrari was great in high-speed corners, the Merc was great in the low-speed corners and in tyre preservation. However, with TD39, and the 2023 floor edge regulations, everything changed.

By mid-2023, Ferrari abandoned the bathtubs, and Merc also joined the Red Bull concept in 2024. The cars more or less look the same now, and while some cars have different qualities than others (McLaren having a high-speed corner advantage last season and a tyre advantage this season), the characteristics of the cars are broadly the same, and the field spread is the lowest it has ever been. This, understandably, makes overtaking difficult, even with DRS. In 2021, while dirty air was still a problem, concept divergence was very strong with three different concepts pioneered by the three major engine manufacturers. Different cars still had different driving characteristics (like the Red Bull high rake concept vs the Merc low rake concept), while having roughly the same pace. This is not the case this season, as the variance in driving characteristics is extremely low.

In conclusion, this regulatory cycle has run its course, and the racing is not going to get any better. Hopefully, the 2026 regs allow for more concept divergence, which in turn will improve the product we see on track. While dirty air, weight, and the size of cars contribute to bad racing, concept convergence is the death knell for a regulatory cycle and what signifies the need for change. I am curious to know if anyone else had any thoughts on this. Thanks for reading.","['>In 2021, while dirty air was still a problem, concept divergence was very strong\n\n...and overtaking was still difficult, so...', 'Spec series literally have identical cars and still far more overtakes than F1. If anything, the smaller the difference between cars is the closer the racing is.', 'Spec series has the best racing though, so all teams being very similar would be ideal.', ""This is a bastardization of what Newey said, and doesn't make much sense from any perspective you look at it. \n\nDo you know what season had better racing than the first half of 2022? 2024. This was because the cars were much closer in performance to each other than at any other times in theses regs. 2022 was more exciting from a car development perspective, because of the concepts being different. In addition, there's something to be said about cars being better in quali or in the race making things more exciting. However, it doesn't make sense to say the racing is not going to get any better this year, after three races, and it really doesn't make sense to blame concept convergence for the poor race in Japan. \n\nIf you looked at the first couple races of 2024, you would have thought we were going to be in for a terrible season. If we followed your hypothesis, it would have been. But we had a genuinely good year of racing overall, with lots of tight battles. \n\nThis year, we've had a fantastic race and a couple of boring ones, what is looking to be a genuine title fight, and four cars within three tenths in both quali and race pace on most circuits. It's very hard to predict, but there is no reason to think this will be a bad year."", 'The issue is mainly the change to the floor edge in 2023. Raising this was done to remove porpoising but ended up forcing teams to try and seal the floor with a bunch of complex structures that created tons of outwash and vorticities.', 'Yeah I don‚Äôt think this is the issue, this wouldn‚Äôt account for 10 car DRS trains when the guy in front is so much slower than the cars behind but he still can‚Äôt be overtaken. The biggest issue is aero wash and the second biggest issue is the size of the cars.', 'I think design convergence and performance convergence can be separately analysed. One thing I really liked about 2022 ground effect regulations is that we had three distinct designs from the top 3 teams - Red Bull Racing, Mercedes, and Ferrari (as you mentioned). With time as teams saw performance benefits in one design over the other (Mercedes abandoning zero sidepods), and teams running into FIA TDs (Ferrari with flexi floor) we eventually see everyone settling into more or less a similar design concept. It just happens to be that McLaren have nailed all the critical parts - suspension geometry as well as sidepods and floor design. It‚Äôs not a coincidence that eventually all cars start to look alike as we get closer to end of current regulations. \n\nNow on the difficulty in overtaking part, it‚Äôs more about teams being closer to one another than ever before (qualifying gaps are a good indicator of just how close the field is) in terms of *performance*, since more or less every team now has a good understanding of current regulations. In Suzuka, Pirelli having an oversight in expected tyre deg due to track resurfacing led them to use same compounds instead of going a step softer which would‚Äôve produced better racing. \n\n2026 regulations are shaping up to be similar to start of turbo-hybrid era in 2014 i.e. [a power unit formula](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/big-chance-f1-2026-is-engine-formula-adrian-newey/). Aero will have little role to play, at least initially, and eventually we will see design as well as performance convergence with time, just like we always do.', 'If the track had been wider with more passing zones then dirty air would be less of a hindrance.', ""Brundle many years ago: the problem is the cars are about 2-3 metres long, and braking distances are usually 100m or less, so you need to be 1-2% better to be halfway alongside.

1jv6inq,2025 Bahrain GP - Build Up Thread,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jv6inq/2025_bahrain_gp_build_up_thread/,2025-04-09, Discussion,"Let's try something new! Let's use this thread to discuss the upcoming race in Bahrain.

**Circuit Information**

The Bahrain International Circuit joined the F1 Calendar in 2004 and was the first country in the Middle East to host a Formula 1 event. In recent years, the circuit has also hosted pre-season testing. The circuit is characterised by many hard braking zones and slow corners, as well as a notoriously abrasive track surface that usually leads to high degradation.

**What happened last year?**

The 2024 Bahrain GP was the season opener and it was a weekend dominated by Red Bull Racing. Many thought the season would be a carbon copy of 2023. Little did we know....

[2024 Race Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y5wMpKXNK4)

**Tyre Selection**

C1 - C2 - C3

This is the same tyre selection as Suzuka however do not expect the same one stopper with zero degradation. The abrasive track surface and long acceleration zones put a lot of stress onto the rear tyres, and the race is typically a two stopper at the very least.

**Weather forecast**

Unlike pre-season testing, which was abnormally cold, we can expect day time temperatures hovering close to 30 degrees celcius. The Bahrain GP is a night race, but with the race being hosted a month later than usual we can still expect track temperatures at lights out to be very high.

**What time is the race?**

Visit the [F1 website](https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2025/bahrain) for timings for all the sessions.

It‚Äôs not as good as the McLaren but let‚Äôs not pretend like it‚Äôs a sauber lol', 'Translation and full article:\n\n\n> Max Verstappen doesn\'t have the best car, but he\'s right in the thick of the World Championship race. Thanks to his class and the right setup changes, he managed to turn things around in Japan. But that won\'t last forever.\n\n> McLaren should really be worried. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have the best car in the field, yet Max Verstappen is breathing down their necks after three races. Norris is one point behind, and Piastri is 13 points ahead. The McLaren drivers should seize the opportunity and build a lead now before Red Bull can turn things around with its car.\n\n> In this way, Max Verstappen won his fourth title in 2024. He used his superior car in the first five races to build a large lead in the World Championship. He then managed the cushion until the end. His advantage is that Red Bull focuses solely on him. His opponents always have to consider both drivers.\n\n> The World Championship will likely come down to a three-way battle between Verstappen and the two McLaren drivers. Mercedes and Ferrari will soon have to find the two to four tenths that separate them from the title contenders. McLaren has a consistent lead. Red Bull will only be able to do so if the engineers finally find the right setting.\n\n> **Off track on Friday.**\nIt was the same pattern at all three Grands Prix this year. On Friday, Red Bull was nowhere to be seen. Just in time for qualifying, the RB21 was competitive with Verstappen at the wheel. In Suzuka, it even made a jump from Saturday to Sunday, even though no further changes to the cars are allowed.\n\n> ""I think the low track temperatures and low tire wear played into our hands. This allowed us to keep the rear tire temperatures under control,"" Verstappen explained. Before qualifying, motor racing director Helmut Marko had set a third-row position as a realistic goal. In the end, it was pole position.\n\n> On Friday, the Red Bull performed so poorly that the driver felt as if something was twisting between the front and rear axles. His car went from understeer to oversteer and back again. Every corner delivered a new surprise. ""Suzuka is a track where you need confidence. And unfortunately, I didn\'t have that,"" the champion apologized.\n\n> **Marko curses Simulator.**\nSporting Director Helmut Marko cursed the simulator work, which had once again produced the wrong setup. ""Whenever the simulator promises us great lap times, things go backwards on the racetrack. That was the case two years ago in Monte Carlo and again this time. I told Max he should rely on his experience rather than what the simulator says.""\n\n> Team principal Christian Horner downplays this: ""The best sensor in the car is the driver. After three practice sessions, we finally managed to get the car into its window. And then, with Max, it was capable of taking pole position and winning."" But Verstappen demands more from Red Bull. He wants a car that no longer requires him to worry about whether the penny will drop in time.\n\n> To be capable of winning at Suzuka, Red Bull had to set up its cars differently in virtually every parameter than the simulation data suggested. One might therefore question the correlation between the tools and reality, but the truth is probably different.\n\n> **Only good in one configuration.**\nThis Red Bull RB21 is a car that only functions in one configuration. And that configuration is different on every track, every day. Therefore, drivers and engineers have no choice but to work towards the perfect setup step by step and hope they achieve it by qualifying.\n\n> The second driver falls behind in this process. He lacks the experience with the car and the class of the lead driver to quickly find his own solution. In the end, he must either follow Verstappen\'s path or insist on his own car setup. Both options cost lap time.\n\n> Technical director Pierre Wach√© admits that the new Red Bull has inherited the problems of the old one. ""The car\'s balance is constantly changing. It takes too long to fix it. And luckily, we have Max in the car to implement it. If we can do it permanently, the car\'s operating window will also expand again.""\n\n> **McLaren improvement in Bahrain?**\nThe Frenchman curses the ground-effect cars that lead many teams into a dead end: ""In the end, it\'s always the same problem: Drive as low and stiffly as possible, make sure the car\'s balance isn\'t lost, and you stay legal with the plank underneath the car."" The previous generation of cars was more frugal. Several solutions led to the goal.\n\n> McLaren is the only racing team that has consistently adjusted its parameters. Team principal Andrea Stella believes he has a trump card in his hand despite the close points standings. ""At the moment, the track layout and conditions still determine the result. That will settle. Then it\'s important to have the best car. You can\'t deliver a masterful performance like Max\'s in Suzuka for 24 races.""\n\n> Many experts expect the McLaren to have an advantage, especially in hotter temperatures. Then the papaya racer can also better exploit its tire advantage. However, it has been quite chilly on each of the three race days so far. That could change in the next two races in Bahrain and Jeddah. McLaren would be well advised to finally convert its pace advantage into points.', ""I'm not an engineer, but from what I can see, the Red Bull really seems to hate any body roll. The car is fast through sharper corners, but it loses out in longer corners with sustained turning. Max lost out marginally to Norris through sector 1 and through spoon despite the McLarens backing off slightly due to having a tricky car at the limit. He made up all the deficit and a little more through the last chicane which can be squared off easily. Also, looking at the last chicane of Max, it was clear the Red Bull's suspension was stiffer than the McLaren's, potentially to reduce body roll through corners, but this would also make kerb riding and traction zones more difficult to nail."", 'In the right hands yes', 'Its definitely blown out of proportion. Or its blowing out of proportion because Lawson just happen to suck the first 2 races. Its not a worst car than Ferrari atm. Media just milking this over and over again. When Mercedes (or atleast George) was qualifying 4th consistently last year, they were not talking about it like they‚Äôre talking about the RB now.', ""so, a car can be either a Mclaren or a Sauber. Based on your logic then every car in between is a 'very good car in the right conditions'. They just don't have Max to show it and win races in a not race winning car, which currently RB21 is."", ""It's actually a good non-sided read holy shit"", '>Norris is one point behind, and Piastri is 13 points ahead\n\nuh what?', 'When has AMUS ever been anything but that lol.

1jv926q,How Max Verstappen takes the next step with Verstappen.com Racing,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jv926q/how_max_verstappen_takes_the_next_step_with/,2025-04-09, News,,"['Jokes aside, proving that sim racing is a pathway comparable to karting for professional racing will be a HUGE thing for the sport. Hope he does well.', 'Translation:\n\nAfter being launched in 2022 as an umbrella for the rally adventure of Jos Verstappen, the GT career of Thierry Vermeulen and the sim race activities of Team Redline, the next step will be taken in 2025 with Verstappen.com Racing by participating in the GT World Challenge Europe (GTWCE) through the support of existing teams. Chris Lulham, who comes from the sim race, will participate in the GTCE Endurance Cup with GTCE drivers Harry King and Thierry Vermeulen in an Aston Martin Vantage AMR GT3 EVO. Next weekend they have their first appointment at Paul Ricard in southern France, where a 6-hour race is scheduled.\n\nOne of Verstappen\'s ambitions is to help talented sim drivers make the step to the real circuit. He wants to prove that sim racing can be a great substitute for a career through karting, which not everyone has the money for. The 22-year-old Lulham is the first sim racer chosen by Verstappen for this. ""Chris has a long track record at Team Redline, Max\'s sim race team,"" Raymond Vermeulen told Motorsport.com. ""Max has a high hat on him, because he always comes with good feedback when adjusting the virtual car. Last year, he once invited Chris for a private test. He got in and had a good speed from the first lap, even though the conditions on the track were very difficult at that time. This made it clear to us that he has a lot of talent and can handle the transition from the sim to the real GT3s. Then we started testing with him more often.‚Äù\n\nThe 24-year-old King has walked a more traditional path. He started in karting before climbing the Ginetta ladder in England. After becoming champion in the Ginetta GT4 Supercup in 2019, titles in the British Porsche Carrera Cup and the Porsche Carrera Cup Benelux followed. Last year he finished second in both the Porsche Supercup and the extremely competitive German Porsche Carrera Cup. ""A fast, experienced boy, a real racer"", describes Vermeulen the Brit. ""After he happened to be available last year due to circumstances, we quickly recorded him for this year."" Vermeulen\'s son Thierry, who has been on the road in motorsport since 2020 and has been part of Verstappen.com Racing since the first hour, completes the driver cast.\n\nVerstappen.com Racing is working with an existing team for the Endurance Cup of the GT World Challenge Europe: 2 Seas Motorsport. ""The relationship with 2 Seas Motorsport has been there for a long time"", Vermeulen explains. ""Nick Cristofaro, who after racing himself has set up his own race team with the Bahraini Isa Al Khalifa, is a good friend of Max."" Since the beginning of 2024, Verstappen has owned an Aston Martin Vantage, which he occasionally takes on the circuit. For these moments, he already called on the team from Silverstone for practical support. Vermeulen: ""It was therefore logical for us to also take this step with them to the Endurance Cup of the GT World Challenge Europe.""\n\n**Despite his busy Formula 1 career, Verstappen is very closely involved in the GT3 project.** For example, he assists the drivers with advice and action during private tests and SIM sessions, but he also interferes with the livery, he has helped find a good basic adjustment for the car and gives his input to the engineers in preparation for the race weekend. ""Of course, he himself made enough meters with that car to be able to make a good contribution to the baseline set-up"", says Vermeulen. **""He also helped develop the sim models of the Aston Martin, so to convert what they tested on the circuit to the sim.""**\n\n**Ambitious goals**\n\nRegarding the goals for the first year of Verstappen.com Racing as a participant in the GT World Challenge Europe, Vermeulen says: ""We are ambitious. We don\'t participate to fill the field, we participate for the marbles. We want to drive at the front regularly."" Vermeulen acknowledges that this will not be an easy task in the extremely competitive GT World Challenge. ""There are big teams with a lot of experience. It will be powered. But we do expect to regularly fight at the front in our class.""\n\nLulham is also participating in the Sprint Cup of the GT World Challenge Europe this year. Together with Thierry Vermeulen, who is starting his third full season in the Sprint Cup, he will drive a Ferrari 296 GT3 from Emil Frey Racing. ""We expect to get podium places,"" said Vermeulen. According to Verstappen\'s agent, the fact that Lulham and Vermeulen are driving two different cars this year is \'only good\'. ""The Ferrari is of course a very different car than the Aston Martin, but that only benefits the development of the driving skills,"" he says. ""They have now tested enough with both cars, so we don\'t expect any problems if they switch from one car to another.""', 'Drop the .com come on.\n\nAlso does anyone else have a vision where Max retires from F1 like 2027/2028 time lile he‚Äôs alluding to and then comes back in five or so years with his new team. Kinda like an irl my team career mode.', 'Lmao the headline made it seem like max proposed to verstappen.com racing', 'Oh dear god, now he‚Äôs training them in a‚Ä¶\n\n*checks notes*\n\nHealthy and supportive way?!??!?\n\nSuck it, Jos.', 'Those moments of ""Max aggression"" you\'ve seen from Max in the past...where he uses the apex, the regulations and every last piece of performance in the car....that\'s essential for a champion F1 driver.', ""The physical side though.  I know there's at least one guy who went from Sim to real life.  I wonder how he found the transition in terms of physical fitness."", '**Live connection**\n\nVerstappen will not be present at the debut of his own GT team next weekend. After all, he has to take action himself at the Bahrain Grand Prix. When Motorsport.com asks Verstappen what he expects from Verstappen.com Racing\'s first performance in the GT World Challenge Europe, he says: ""It\'s always difficult to say something in advance because you\'re dependent on the BoP, but the goal is to be the best Aston Martin anyway."" Laughing: ""No pressure, guys! On the other hand: it\'s only good if there\'s a little pressure on it, right?""\n\n""We\'re in the Gold Cup, but the reference is the top. We have to compare ourselves to that"", says Verstappen, who has every confidence in his driver cast. ""They have tested a lot. It certainly won\'t be because of that. We have tested on all circuits where we are going and gathered a lot of information. Now it\'s up to them and the team to get the most out of it."" Verstappen says he will follow the operations of Lulham, Vermeulen and King closely, even though he drives in Bahrain himself. **""I have a live connection, so I can keep a close eye on everything"", he says. ""There will undoubtedly be something to improve after the first race weekend, but the main thing is that you continue to take steps. I\'m very curious how they\'re going to do it.‚Äù**\n\nVerstappen regularly comes into action during private tests. Could he also start for Verstappen.com Racing? Vermeulen: ""I\'ll see that happen."" To then make it clear that this will not happen in the short term. ""Of course, his main program remains Formula 1. In doing so, we have to take into account all kinds of commercial interests, if Max were to step into a car other than his Red Bull. But maybe they are not negative about that - after all, they are out-of-the-box thinking - we haven\'t asked them yet."" It is known that Verstappen would also like to participate in the 24 hours of Le Mans. Father Jos indicated last year that this will not happen to him again. Maybe it could happen with Chris Lulham and Thierry Vermeulen? Vermeulen senior: ""Who knows. And then you might also need a fourth.‚Äù\n\n**Other pillars**\n\nIn addition to the GT World Challenge Europe, Thierry Vermeulen is participating in the DTM for the third year. Last season there was already a pole position, a few fastest laps and a podium spot. A somewhat clumsy violation at a pit stop meant that he grabbed in the German touring cars in addition to his first victory. Expectations for this year are high.\n\n""Thierry has two fast guys riding next to him this season with Jack Aitken and Ben Green at Emil Frey Racing, where he should be able to pull himself up well. I hope they can help him take the next step"", says Vermeulen senior. ""Hopefully he can smell the podium more often this year. In any case, he must be able to finish in the top ten regularly.""\n\nJos Verstappen has a very busy program this year with the Belgian Rally Championship (BRC) and the European Rally Championship (ERC), among others. ""Formula 1 is of course the top, but after that he thinks rally is the most beautiful thing there is"", says Vermeulen. Does he still have time to attend Max\'s races this year? Vermeulen: ""His agenda is overcrowded. I think he will still be present at a few Formula 1 races. But even if he\'s not there, he doesn\'t miss anything. We have a group app and are in constant contact with each other.""\n\nUnder the leadership of Atze Kerkhof, Team Redline continues to achieve one success after another in sim racing. New in 2025 is Verstappen.com Pro Simulation, which also runs Kerkhof and is actually a continuation of what was previously Adrenaline Control. ""That is a professional simulator that racing teams use and both young talents and experienced drivers come to hone their driving skills. And for us it is an opportunity to scout good guys, who we can then help further.""\n\nThe whole is still supported by Red Bull. ""We have a longer-term contract, which also says something about how loyal we are to Red Bull, despite everything that is said and written,"" Vermeulen said. The collaboration with Red Bull is basically separate from what is happening in Formula 1. Even if Verstappen ever left Red Bull\'s F1 team in the future, the energy drink brand could continue to support Verstappen.com Racing. ""I don\'t see why not. They support a lot of teams and riders.‚Äù Vermeulen also sees the fact that Verstappen.com Racing is very successfully active in sim racing as added value for Red Bull. ""When Max is racing sim, he\'s just in the Red Bull shirt of Team Redline in the simulator.""\nWhether that wide range of activities is still a bit too fad for Verstappen? Vermeulen: ""It\'s relaxation for him. One is going to play football, the other is going to play billiards and Max is going to sim race, get started with set-ups and with Thierry and the other Verstappen.com Racing drivers call about how their tests went. This is Max\'s way of relaxing.""', ""I very much dislike the `.com` as well as it injects this disconnect, abruptly pulling you towards a **digital** thing or service instead of racing.\n\nBut then... It's a simracing ‚ü© racing team. \n\nSo... I guess I  hate that I actually find low key ingenious this thing that I certainly dislike?""]",37,11,0.81,37,10,10,37,11,0.81,37

1jv4trz,Does F1 have a well-known problem with dirty air and low tire wear?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jv4trz/does_f1_have_a_wellknown_problem_with_dirty_air/,2025-04-09, Discussion,"The Suzuka GP was one of the most boring races in recent years. Few overtaking maneuvers or even attempts to overtake among the top teams. On the strategic side, it wasn't exciting either with only one stop.  
I have now heard/read several voices saying that dirty air is again a problem (similar to before 2022), which makes overtaking increasingly difficult. In addition, the enormous size of the current F1 generation can no longer offer good racing on the popular oldschool circuits such as Imola, Monaco or now apparently Suzuka.  
Consequently the leader can set a slow pace to save tires and material as an attack by the opponent can hardly be expected. At the beginning of the race we had lap times of 1:33 at the front, after the stops the times dropped to 1:32 at the end to a low 1:31. I understand that the cars get lighter towards the end of the race but Antonelli's fastest lap of 1:30.9 is still 4 seconds slower than Verstappen's pole time of 1:26.9.  
The overview of the fastest lap times shows what kind of pace the cars still have. Most of the fastest laps were set around 8 laps before the end of the race, but at this point the tires were already 20-30 laps old.  
It almost seems as if nobody wants to attack, as it is almost impossible to overtake. The risk is then far too great that the tires are pushed too hard and you have to pay the high price towards the end of the stint.  
Pirelli is now responding with very soft tire compounds for Miami and Imola, but this does not really solve the problem. There is a risk that we will have another tire chaos like in 2017/2018 with superultrahypersoft tires.

As Vasseur has already said, we will probably have a qualifying world championship this year. It will be exciting, but not because the races are so good, but because the teams are only a few tenths to thousandths apart in the qualifying sessions and qualifying (it seems) is the decisive factor for the race result. The pace on one lap is more important than the race pace over 50 laps or more.  
Will it change with the new regulations from 2026?

*  Bring back refueling. 
   * Shit ton of strategy comes back into play. Fuel heavy and go long with hards? Go light and fast on softs? Lap times could be 4-6 seconds different between the two - it would definitely let some more miracle wins happen IMO put more things up into chance (SC, caught out in the back, etc.)
   * Allows us to have smaller, lighter cars. Smaller fuel cell also allows for a smaller frame overall, so we can get more exciting racing. Won't help Monaco until we give them all spec-super-charged F4 cars.
   * A less than 0.5% chance of fire is small, and if there is a fire, people are in protective suits, are trained, and looks cool and would get world-wide attention. Win-win except for the people who get caught on fire, but they're probably going to be okay.
* Mandatory 2 pit-stops
   * No red flag shenanigans that has happened in the past where we get no pit action.
   * Could require all 3 compounds to be used, or, go like Indy, bring compounds down to 2, and force teams to use at least 1 new tire per compound in the race (effectively making it a mando 2 stop)
   * Gives the pit crew more NIL opportunities with their on-screen-time. The drivers have too much focus right now anyways.
* Points for every position
   * No one gives a shit about Stroll fighting a Sauber/Alpine for 19th, however, if its worth 1 championship point, people would care more. We'd get more chaos as people fight tooth and nail for every point possible.
   * Scale it up obviously, and yes that means we'd have people in the 1000s if they have a great season - that's okay. They are points, they have changed multiple times before - no one cares it doesn't matter that Senna only got X points.
* Weekend format change
   * Friday - FP1, Quali
   * Saturday - Sprint Race (reverse entire grid) at 65% distance of main race
   * Sunday - Main Race
      * Things that change in this format - 
      * This benefits us from a very predictable race if teams are given 3 hours of track time to figure things out. We get more racing instead of practice. Gives fans a better reason to attend the Friday instead of just free practice- some races do not have support races so literally all they have those 2 days is just free practice. 
      * We'll have the best drivers trying to knife throughout the field. They will move up the grid - the slower drivers/cars will fall back. While some might certainly win the sprint race from the front, most will not.
      * Gives more TV time so F1 can make more $ (the reason this would happen)
* Allow teams to enter a 3rd car for 1 race per season.
   * More for lulz but would allow reserve drivers to get some action, or some rookies. Should bring a little more chaos. I am guessing most do at their home GP, so Ferrari would run 3 at Monza, RB 3 at Suzuka (this year) but normally at RBR with VCarb. McL, AM, Merc & Williams all probably run 3 at Silverstone.
