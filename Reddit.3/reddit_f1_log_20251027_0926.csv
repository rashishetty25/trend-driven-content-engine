No one can stop the car at 250kph or even react to human on track if they exist at blind spot. At this point we are just waiting for disasters to happen.

Lando was always the quicker driver in 2023 and 2024 but was struggling earlier in the year - now he’s more comfortable with the car it’s a different story.', 'He certainly knows how to say things to play to his online audience, both in the media and on the radio. Mark Webber has taught him all his tricks with that one.\n\nStella has already explained more than once exactly what the issue has been the last two weeks. He did so again yesterday. He also said they have been working with Oscar on it, so he knows himself exactly what it is.', 'Or because McLaren have sewn up the WCC, there’s no requirement to share setups between the drivers?', 'Papaya rules: Lando had a slump in form early this season, so Oscar must have one too, if he wants one or not. (/s btw)', ""Let's get the conspiracy theories going."", 'I can\'t verify this, but apparently (take thing on the internet with a grain of salt and all that), in the data, hidden by the lock-ups and inconsistency when Lando didn\'t have any feel for the front axle, he was actually 0.2 faster than Piastri. All the time. Ideal Norris lap > ideal Piastri lap. That advantage Lando had never went away, and Oscar didn\'t magically take a step forward. We know it didn\'t play out that way most of the time because Norris\xa0was inconsistent and never put many good corners together on the same lap.\n\nIf true -- again, caveats everywhere, this is the internet -- Oscar is sort of mythologising why he was on top. And I get it. In a competitive situation it\'s probably better to think ""I\'m as good as anyone"" than ""meh I had a good run, I was leading more on The Other Car struggling than my own pace"". \n\nOf course, if Lando continues to wipe the floor with him, maybe being more realistic will be a better and healthier mental space in the long term. We\'ll see.', 'Car still works well, someone managed to win the race by just 30 seconds with it.', 'What’s fascinating to me is that people were so ready to shit on lando and not question how the guy how annihilated Danny Ric and had easily the measure of Oscar suddenly looked so scruffy, and now that he no longer is (which can be explained both from a car and a mental point of view) and we are right back where we were on years past it’s so unfathomable.\n\nMany of you are so allergic to giving lando his flowers it’s really funny']",47,89,0.84,47,86,86,47,89,0.84,47

Incredibly harsh on Lewis to be the only one penalised while Max and Charles don't.\n\nIn addition, he gets floor damage which hampers his pace and thus he's unable to build much of a gap to the cars behind, so when he takes the penalty he drops behind all of Bearman, Oscar and both Mercs."", 'So basically Leclerc helped Verstappen to get rid of his teammate, a strategy have been used by Oscar this season to deal with his teammate.

1oh7gaq,Jenson Button's 2010 'Butterfly Effect' Rewrote F1 History,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oh7gaq/jenson_buttons_2010_butterfly_effect_rewrote_f1/,2025-10-27, Discussion,"A single driver move in 2010 changed the trajectory of multiple champions and the dynamics of the entire grid. When Jenson Button, fresh off his championship win with Brawn GP (the team that became Mercedes), opted for McLaren, he set off a chain of events that defined the next decade of F1.
What if Button had stayed?
Button at Mercedes (the dominant era): Button, with his smooth style and skill, would have had a second golden opportunity. He likely would have won multiple championships in the hybrid era, much like Lewis Hamilton.
Hamilton at McLaren: Without Button, Lewis's story with McLaren would have continued. He might have stayed longer, but it's unlikely he would have tolerated the McLaren-Honda disaster. His frustration would have pushed him to seek another top team, like Ferrari, completely changing his trajectory.
Vettel at Red Bull: Sebastian Vettel's frustration with Mercedes' dominance was the main reason for his departure to Ferrari in 2014. With Button at the wheel of the dominant Mercedes, Vettel might have hung on longer at Red Bull. This would have affected the rise of other drivers, like Sergio Pérez and Max Verstappen.
Verstappen's rise delayed: With Vettel still at Red Bull, the opportunity for Max Verstappen wouldn't have come so quickly. Max's meteoric rise, with his 2016 victory, would likely have been delayed by several years.
Ferrari and other teams: If Pérez had signed with Ferrari (a real possibility in 2013), the team's lineup would have been very different. Also, Nico Rosberg's retirement after the intense rivalry with Hamilton never would have happened, so Bottas wouldn't have arrived at Mercedes in 2017.


Without Jenson Button we would never have seen the dominance of Hamilton or Max Verstappen, nor Alonso in the Honda era, nor even Vettel at Ferrari, nor the retirement of Rosberg and the signing of Bottas at Mercedes.So obviously events from 2010 to 2025 would never have happened but anyway what do you think? 


","['Lot of assumptions in there. Would Button have retained his seat through the hybrid era? Especially if Vettel or Hamilton came knocking. Could Button have seen off the challenge from Rosberg? Verstappen was originally a Mercedes driver - Wolff had no place for him back when he had Hamilton-Rosberg in the team, but what if it was a Rosberg-Button lineup?\n\nFact is, Button had quite a few hiccups even during his 2009 run to the title. He was never as highly rated in the paddock as the likes of Hamilton, Alonso & Vettel - and the elite drivers will usually have a hotline to the best teams and vice versa.', 'A lot of big driver moves honestly do shake things up. If Verstappen moves tomorrow to a different team a lot would change again. If and buts of the sport is what makes the sport so great to me.', 'Yeah well if, if, if. If my mom had balls…', 'You can do that with a lot of big driver moves.', ""and Michael wouldn't have gone on to that ski trip :("", ""If it's that obvious what would've happened, why didn't Button simply stay at McLaren???"", ""Button signed with McLaren because he wasn't wanted by Mercedes. Bear in mind the day he announced he signed with McLaren was the day Mercedes announced a controlling stake in Brawn."", ""The Brawn season was what allowed him to show he can be elite as well. But you are right, it wasn't really a straightforward season. He was brilliant in the McLaren 2010-2012, even beating Lewis on points in 2011."", ""Even if he raced with Mercedes 2010 onwards I don't see them keeping him for the hybrid era, for the exact reason you mention."", ""Yeah I agree. If Button stayed for the hybrid era then I think Rosberg would have had the better of Button. Especially 2014-2016 when Mercedes were a class ahead of everyone else.\n\nWhile Button had areas where I think he was stronger than Rosberg, Nico was comfortably faster in qualifying. In seasons where the two Mercedes only had to worry about each other and you couldn't really win out on strategy against your team mate Button would have been starting on the back foot most of the time.""]",11,15,0.64,11,15,15,3,7,0.010000000000000009,3

1ogkagc,Data Analysis & Prediction for 2025 Mexican GP (Showing the Work This Time!),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ogkagc/data_analysis_prediction_for_2025_mexican_gp/,2025-10-26, Technical,"Hey everyone,

After my last analysis on Sainz's Singapore stint got some (deservedly) critical feedback here about not explaining the ""how"" and using ""voodoo math,"" I wanted to share my prediction attempt for the **2025 Mexican GP** using a more transparent, data-driven approach.

This isn't a fancy ML model, just core data analysis using Python/FastF1 to calculate key performance factors and simulate a prediction based on weighted scores. The goal is to show the data behind the ranking.

**Data & Features Used:**

1. **Adjusted Grid:** Used official Quali results + applied the confirmed **+5 place penalty for Sainz**.

1. **FP2 Long Run Pace:** Calculated average pace from FP2 Medium tyre stints (5-10 laps), making sure to filter out in/out laps (`pick_quicklaps`). 

https://preview.redd.it/4rs1drstegxf1.png?width=1136&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4e6b591ca7189b6d9670b20a1cb40d6e08469bc

1. **FP2 Tyre Degradation:** Calculated the linear degradation slope (s/lap increase) for the same FP2 stints using `numpy.polyfit`*.* 

&#8203;

    Average Tyre Degradation Slope per Driver (s/lap):
    HAM   -0.248982
    ANT    0.101776
    VER    0.155473
    LEC    0.241527
    RUS    0.382383

1. **Track History:** Average finishing position at this track (2021-2024), excluding DNFs.

**The Numbers:**

    NOR                   32.6%  
    HAM                   25.7%  
    LEC                   21.3%  
    RUS                    7.7%  
    VER                    6.7%  

**Why the Simulation Ranks Them This Way:**

* The data simulation points towards **Lando Norris (NOR)** as the favorite (32.6%) mainly because **starting on Pole Position gives him a significant advantage** according to the weights used. While his FP2 long run wasn't long enough to calculate specific pace/degradation, the model imputes competitive median values, which aren't enough to overcome the benefit of starting P1.
* **Lewis Hamilton (HAM)** looks strong (25.7%) primarily due to **showing the potentially fastest average long-run pace in FP2**. However, the simulation slightly penalizes him for starting further back (P5) compared to Norris. *(Note: His FP2 degradation data also looked unusual with very short stints, adding some uncertainty).*
* **Charles Leclerc (LEC)** is predicted third (21.3%), benefiting from a **strong P3 start**. His main limiting factor in the simulation is his **higher expected tyre degradation** based on the FP2 analysis, potentially forcing a less optimal strategy compared to the leaders.
* **Worth noting:** **Carlos Sainz (SAI)** put in a solid qualifying effort (P7), but his **+5 grid place penalty** significantly impacts his starting position (P12) and therefore heavily lowers his predicted win probability in this simulation, despite potentially decent underlying pace metrics.

Crucially, this ranking explains the ""how"" the prediction was reached: it's the result of **combining these specific, calculated metrics** (Adjusted Grid Position, FP2 Avg Pace, FP2 Avg Degradation, Historical Finish) using the described weighted simulation. Different weights or models would yield different results, but this shows the logic based on *this* analysis.

**Limitations:** Obviously, this doesn't account for the start, strategy genius/blunders, safety cars, reliability, etc. It's purely based on the performance data we have *before* the race.

Let me know what you think of the data and the approach this time! Did I miss anything obvious? Who's your pick? Suggest any platforms for publishing blogs/ advices welcome on how to write blogs since I didn't do very well last time.

You've grabbed the qualifying positions and some FP data, made up a few weights, and calculated win probabilities? That doesn't show anything -- I can add up whatever values I want and predict a winner.\xa0\n\n\nWhere's the work to show that there's any efficacy in this approach to begin with?\xa0Surely the first step would be to take these same parameters, and then apply the model to every completed race in the season and then compare your prediction versus the actual result.\xa0"", 'Cool stuff. Any reason to use Pip instead of uv? uv is superior these days imo. I took a quick look at the code, looks good. Bit of AI agent code going on here? few things looked odd. Teams ran race pace on softs and mediums btw. I edited it to include both and did a [Box plot](https://imgur.com/zkMMEFJ) and a [violin](https://imgur.com/FjwDjYR). might make sense to do something like this and it might let you display runs on each compound for the same driver. see a bit more.
