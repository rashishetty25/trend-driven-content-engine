1l7stmd,"[OT] Interested in watching the 24H of Le Mans this weekend, but not sure where to start?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l7stmd/ot_interested_in_watching_the_24h_of_le_mans_this/,2025-06-10, Featured,"#Overview

You can start with having a look at the Le Mans [entry list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_24_Hours_of_Le_Mans#Entry_list) and lending me an ear for a few minutes. The 24 Hours of Le Mans is the biggest endurance race every year, and is **this Saturday to Sunday**, 4PM local time around the clock, in Le Mans, France. It is the feature race of the World Endurance Championship, referred to as WEC for short. 

Hypercar cars compete in the top class in the WEC and at Le Mans gunning for overall victory honours. This weekend they number 21 cars, from 8 well known car manufacturers, 19 of which are entered by fully factory WEC or IMSA teams. They are the headline act of the 62 car grid. 

The Hypercar manufacturers are Ferrari, Porsche, Toyota, Alpine, BMW, Peugeot, Cadillac and Aston Martin.

Teams of three drivers in each car compete in all Le Mans categories for victory, either overall or in class. 

Le Mans is a highly historic race. Coming about in the early days of motorsport, being held almost every year since 1923, with this being the 93rd running of the race. It has been the premier endurance race since the 50's, with strong and historically important periods throughout the decades after until today - Ford Vs Ferrari in the 60s, and the original ""Golden Era"", the Group C era of the 80's amongst them. It is one of the triple crown of motorsport races, the others being the Indy 500 and the Monaco Grand Prix.

The full 13.6km/8.47mi Le Mans circuit, known formally as Circuit de la Sarthe, is a classic of worldwide motorsport. Largely unchanged for decades. It features the famous 6km/3.7mi Mulsanne straight, in the modern era interrupted by two chicanes. This circuit rewards cars with high top speed, but has some epic high speed turns to keep drivers on their toes on long stints as well. At the start and after safety cars (rare in Le Mans, as the circuit uses Slow Zones for repairs and cleanup primarily) the massive train of Hypercars flying down the straights is truly something to behold - even if just on TV, it's still a standout in motorsport. The battling in Hypercar is top notch at Le Mans as well, thanks to the long straights.

All 8 WEC Hypercar manufacturers have 2 cars apiece full time in the series. But, for Le Mans, there are 3 additional factory entered cars coming from IMSA - 2 Cadillacs, and a Porsche. The AF Corse Ferrari 499P is a full WEC season entry ""factory satellite"" effort (with AF Corse being the Ferrari factory team and this operating alongside but not entirely separately), and is highly competitive. The Proton Porsche 963 is a fully stand-alone ""privateer"" team run full season WEC entry, rounding out our count of 21 Hypercars. Proton also operate the full WEC season Mustang LMGT3 effort.

There is a second tier but very fast LMP2 category, and a road based car LMGT3 category which is 99% the same as normal GT3 sportscar racing cars - the kind that should you pass the sniff test you can order at the dealership for track use. This is the class where the Porsche 911 GT3 road car got it's name from.

Having had a look at the entry list and this infodump I would then recommend checking out some sportscar racing action - you don't need to get too bogged down in the nitty gritty right away. Enjoy these Detroit Sportscar Classic IMSA highlights from a week ago!

This race features GTP, which is the same as Hypercar but using a historic IMSA class name, and GTD-Pro, which is a GT3 class with all pro drivers. It's nowhere near as long as Le Mans and on a very different circuit but this was a good race and I think it gives you a good taste of what to expect with sportscar racing. IMSA is basically the US version of WEC ala F1 and Indycar, but the cars are now the same across WEC and IMSA.

#How to watch Le Mans

If you are interested in watching Le Mans, you will have to figure out how you're going to watch. In the US [Max](https://www.max.com/us/en) is the exclusive broadcaster. In the UK it is available on TNT Sports 4 (I believe this is where the Eurosport team are now), Discovery+, or the FIAWECtv app/website. The rest of the world can watch either on FIAWECtv app or their local broadcast - info linked below, I found a better local broadcaster info page in PDF.

It is possible to purchase the ability to watch just Le Mans on FIAWECtv if you want to dip a toe in that way (18 Euro), or to purchase Le Mans and the rest of the WEC season as a package (50 Euro).

A quick side note edit: The Canadian Grand Prix runs after Le Mans Sunday night France time, so you won't miss a minute of either race, should you want to watch both, like me!

#Extra Information

Hypercars are the feature of Le Mans in the modern era, but they are backed up by some strong supporting acts. LMP2 only features in WEC at Le Mans - full season these cars and teams are seen in the European Le Mans Series, and many in the Asian Le Mans Series during winter. It is a second tier ""Le Mans Prototype"" with a focus on ""value for money"" >!(for multimillionaires)!< but is so fast it has to be slowed down for Hypercars to be able to get by more easily. LMGT3 is at every race in the WEC season, as is Hypercar. LMGT3 is essentially the same as your standard GT3, with perhaps a modification here or there and with torque sensors to measure performance - which do not feature on a regular GT3.

LMP2 and LMGT3 are not all-pro classes. Drivers in sportscar racing get graded from Platinum down to Bronze. LMGT3 is limited to one unlimited class driver, one Silver driver, and one Bronze driver. LMP2 is required to have either a Bronze or Silver driver, with the Bronze LMP2 drivers getting their own LMP2 Pro/Am subclass. This is as factory efforts in WEC are focused on the Hypercar category, and funding for the cars has to come from somewhere, so Bronze ""gentleman"" drivers and Silver drivers bring funding to the race team.

It's standard procedure to get the Bronze driver time out of the way early. This is as drivers have various rules requiring minimum and maximum time, as well as maximum stint length. The result is that you often later on in the race get the top drivers in all cars, meaning you see top quality driving and battling up and down the field. And even though some drivers are rated Bronze, I bet they would show up all but very few of those reading this on track! The level required for Le Mans competition and success is no joke and LMGT3 and the LMP2 classes have fantastic drivers.

The lower classes also present opportunities for the upper classes in their own battles. Say you have caught up to your competitor in Hypercar, slashing a 10 second gap down to one or two. There is still dirty air in WEC, but it's not so bad that we need artificial aids like DRS - every pass and inch of track position in sportscar racing is earned, none are granted. Your competitor could get held up through a series of corners by a lower class LMP2, and you close in. But you don't get held up, so you're right on him, or perhaps you even blast by.

These sorts of situations are part of the magic and joy of watching sportscar racing. As well as multiple races going on on track to follow, the multiclass nature itself adds an extra element that you don't get in a series like Formula 1.

There is a Balance of Performance measure for Le Mans competing cars in Hypercar and LMGT3. This is an attempt at making the playing field more level for the competitors in the series. This is both for a limiting measure on teams spending money on development, as any benefit will be accounted for, and also to lessen the chassis advantage across the field, so that strategy, driving, and pitlane execution are more important. Give the best team the opportunity to shine, not the one that bankrolled nine figures of development last winter. 

BoP is done with power, weight and fuel allowance. Power is done in two stages, below 250kph and above 250kph. Fuel allowance is to make strategy across the grid more fair by giving each team a very similar stint length to work with.

There is no BoP in LMP2. Due to it's initial strong performance the Oreca 07 emerged the choice of the grid after a few years, with few teams even attempting to use the other LMP2 chassis that were designed to the LMP2 formula. It is coming up on 10 years in competition, and we will be very sad to see the Oreca 07 and it's legendary LMP2 standard N/A Gibson V8 engine depart at the end of  2027, as we get new LMP2's in '28 . LMP2 battles are hair raising as they too are passing LMGT3 traffic but they don't have the big speed boost over the GT's with lower power than Hypercar. Leads to some inventive solutions to overtaking!

Le Mans can be overwhelming with 62 different cars competing. What can be really handy is a Spotters guide. Thankfully our friends over at https://spotters.guide/ have us covered! Getting this printed out before the race can be really, really useful - even us seasoned fans use the spotters guides because LMP2 and the extra LMGT3 cars can be hard to keep on top of. The spotters guide will get a couple updates as inevitably there will be a few errors, so maybe hold off on printing until Thursday or Friday. But good to have a look at what the cars look like and who's who.

It‚Äôs the most important factor in how the race will play out. How come F1 hasn‚Äôt made an effort to present those figures like temperatures and pressures on the feed?

I‚Äôm convinced that if the information were publicly available, it would a) be super cool to know more about components of the car, and b) add an intriguing instrument to race tactics.

1l84n4d,How good is Rafael Camara?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l84n4d/how_good_is_rafael_camara/,2025-06-10, Discussion,"Kid is dominating F3 right now. 4 poles in 5 races and 3 wins in 5 feature races. And I feel like there isn‚Äôt a lot of buzz around him. He is 20 years old so is that why people are less excited about this? Maybe I‚Äôm just not in the loop and there is some hype for this guy? I really have no idea and have never heard of him before this f3 season. 

What are your thoughts? Will this kid get a real shot at formula 1? ","['He looks really good tbh. I think age is less of an issue than the relative skill of the other drivers in the category at the same moment - it matters who you beat, more than anything. That‚Äôs my impression. And he‚Äôs doing an okay job. I really rated Gabrielle Mini last year and this year the kid‚Äôs all of nowhere in F2. Maybe that‚Äôs not a pace issue but a team issue, I don‚Äôt know.', ""Somewhere between Verstappen and Mazepin I'd say"", ""He's a Ferrari junior driver, so I wouldn't say he doesn't have hype.\n\nIt's pretty well believed that Trident is the best team in F3. They did win the last two years with Bortoleto and then Fornoroli... who didn't win a race and people don't seem that impressed with, because no F1 team has picked him up as a junior.\n\nNow, there is a new car in F3, so you'd think there might be a toss up of teams, and there definitely is for some teams (Prema is now terrible), but Trident definitely seems on top. \n\nIf you haven't heard of him before this season, I assume it's because you don't watch series below F3. He literally won FRECA last year, so clearly you didn't watch that. (Though, to be fair, FRECA is one of my least favorite junior series.)\n\nHe spent his F4 and first year of FRECA pretty consistently being behind Prema teammate Kimi Antonelli- who he is older than. But Kimi is the more unusual age one. Rafa's a bit older than ideal, but his age isn't a problem.\n\nHis Ferrari rival in F3 is Tuukka, who is on a worse team. We'll know more of what Ferrari thinks when they are ready for FP1s."", ""Unless it's someone like Antonelli or Slater, it's too early for serious hype if a driver isn't in F2 yet.\n\nJust look at the top 5 from 2020: Piastri, Pourchaire, Sargeant, Vesti and Lawson. They were all fighting for the championship, but each of their careers turned out completely different. Piastri and Pourchaire were considered the biggest talents. One of them is currently leading the championship in F1, and the other is in LMP2.\n\nCamera is probably good, but not exceptional. Who knows what will happen to him in F2."", 'Quality pace, unbelievable in qualifying, but racecraft has room for improvement. Wheel to wheel can leave him being found wanted, now whether that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs got one eye on the title and is being cautious or not.\n\nHowever, you can‚Äôt teach pace. You can teach racecraft. So he‚Äôs in a good position', ""He's doing great, but he kinda seems like next Valtteri Bottas to me. Extremely fast in quali and clean air, but lacks ability to cut through the field. Things are playing in his favour though, with Hamilton being close to retirement and Bearman being next in line he has good chance for Haas seat in couple of years. Age isn't really that much of a problem for him if he keeps performing like this, being as old as Bearman is rather indication of Bearman being rushed into F1 than Camara being too old."", ""He was in FRECA at the same time as Antonelli and only just progressed to F3. As much as I think giving drivers time to learn their craft is a good idea, it doesn't seem to be what F1 teams are looking for."", ""He got quite comprehensively beaten by Antonelli when they were teammates across multiple series\n\nAlso it's f3, give it time"", ""I think age is definitely an issue that dampens the hype. He is older than Bearman, while he is a rookie in F3. And in FRECA Antonelli was quite a bit more impressive. He might get a shot in F1, but the Ferrari Academy also has Taponen in F3, who is younger, but is in a worse team, so it's hard to compare them.""]",120,74,0.86,120,71,71,18,13,0.020000000000000018,18

And then a top team like Red Bull potentially being confined to the midfield for years because of an underpowered PU would be a disaster for the sport since Max could retire and a Maxless Red Bull would fall apart completely.\n\nIf everyone who doesn't have a Merc PU is screwed until the 2030s then the whole DTS boom will quickly end."", 'TL:DW It seems that there was a lot of politics involved during Seidl/Hoffman\'s time and Binotto and Wheatley have had to fix that first.
