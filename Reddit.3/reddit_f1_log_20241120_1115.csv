1guz22f,Why is George beating or matching Lewis for 2 seasons out of 3 so overlooked?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1guz22f/why_is_george_beating_or_matching_lewis_for_2/,2024-11-19, Discussion,"Seriously, unless we agree that Lewis is basically nowhere near his prime level, then why is Russell not getting any credit for what he’s doing.

Yet people act like he’s merely a top midfield driver, worse than the likes of Leclerc, Sainz, or Norris. But then people like to think Lewis will go on to suddenly be super competitive with supposedly a superior driver to George next year, Leclerc.

I think George is the most underrated driver on the grid right now because people do not like him. Lewis is a top 3 driver of all time at worst, so where does that put George talent wise? 

Sure, people always go about “experimental setups” or “Lewis is just unmotivated”, but, I’m sorry, that’s just a cop-out. Then we can just argue endlessly that basically no driver is worse than another driver, since there could always be intangibles like that, “oh, he just doesn’t care about driving in midfield cars”. really? 


I think George is at least Leclerc level. Leclerc got a lot more credit for beating Vettel in 2019, and Vettel is not close to Lewis in driving skill. So why the discrepancy? I think it’s just that people overlook George because they don’t like him on a personal level","[""I think people notice it, but it's hard put value on it with the merc being so all over the place with its performance. It's hard to compare when we have no real baseline when it comes to the car."", 'personally i’m curious to see how george and lewis do next year to grasp where they actually are because this merc is a very confusing car. Even if lewis is past his prime imo he is way too good of a driver to be struggling to get into the points.

Otherwise you wouldn't stop hearing about it."", '> Leclerc got a lot more credit for beating Vettel in 2019\n\nIt was Charles 2nd season in F1 against a driver who was competing for a title the season before. \n\nIn general I do agree Russell has been underrated but don’t agree with all the arguments you’ve put forward.', 'Is it a hot take to say that George is better than Norris?\nI mean this was literally the result in F2, and people seem to forget that.', 'I mean it’s actually about set up issues and a horrible car as a whole.

They’re 2 points apart this year and last year Lewis ended third, while George ended up in 8th place.', 'It’s hard to actually value the performances seeing as both drivers and team are so hit and miss. \n\nOver the 3 years though George has done a great job and I’d be surprised if Redbull don’t ask for him in a swap should Merc sign Max', 'The only people who genuinely think Russell is ""only a top midfielder"" are the type of \'fans\' who are far too comfortable in spouting their ignorance in general about the sport. He\'s clearly comfortably in the Leclerc & Norris (and potentially Piastri in the future) bracket, and those who try and argue otherwise are just trying to fuel a narrative that fits whatever agenda they have.\n\nThat said, you\'re also making some statements in there regarding Lewis & Vettel that really don\'t make you look too much better.', 'George is in a quagmire. If he never beat Lewis at all, they’d say he’s the second coming of kovalainen and a burn out. If he beat Lewis three out of three seasons, it’s because Lewis is “past his prime” and “not all there anymore”. \n\nIn reality, he’s acquainted himself well under the toughest of circumstances, going up against the veritable goat in struggling cars. He’s taken it right to Lewis from the start and came out on top in 2022. Lewis crushed him in 23, but they’ve both made the best where possible of this year’s car. For all intents and purposes, this pairing is exactly what we expected to be but without the championship contending cars we expected to be underneath them.\n\nNow that Lewis is leaving, George has a narrow window to really stake his claim to the throne before the Antonelli tidal wave becomes overwhelming. He has to crush Kimi utterly and make him look like he never deserved to be here in the first place.']",3030,1227,0.82,3030,14925,14925,47,4,0.009999999999999898,47

I’m not even going to talk about him winning the F3 and F2 championship, but more so his last year in F1, in arguably one of the worst cars of the decade. 
I don’t think his season next to Mazepin needs to be mentioned, due to how bad Nikki was. 

But in his last year in F1, while he did have a very poor start, and a lot of expensive crashes, he had brillant 2nd half of the season. He beat Magnussen 6-4 in races, 12-10 in points, on his own merit. 
He also took the Haas to Q3 in his second year in F1, something that took 3 seasons for Russell (still a better driver, don’t get me wrong) in a still bad but somewhat better Williams. 

These stats are not incredible, I get that. But considering the fact that his rookie season in F1 was in Haas’ worst year in terms of performance and inner-politics, many times many seconds of the pace of the next team, it’s hard to fault him for having a hard time to adjust to F1. I think many drivers that we consider to be the best, would have had a horrid time in those two seasons at Haas as well, trying to maximize capacity from the terrible car, while juggling with the politics and bad relationships inside the F1 team.

He beat his team mate consistently (outside of a pitstop issue not fault of his own in Zandvoort) in the last 10 races of 2022. 
Half the grid can’t beat their better team mate with that much consistency after a slow start of the season, or have that clear of a progression in performance. There’s usually always a main contender, a number 1 driver, across an entire season, with the 2nd driver usually struggling all year to catch the level of the 1st one, only to sometimes match it. 

And for that reason, I believe he deserves a spot in F1 more so than many drivers on this grid. (Some are already leaving us next year, though.)

He doesn't lack the money, his family's net worth is in the 9 figures and he definitely doesn't lack sponsors as just his name is a big attraction plus all the connections he has through his father. The thing is, he just isn't good enough.\n\nMagnussen was better than him in 2022. Sure Mick was a little bit better in the second half of the season but he also crashed way more. And not like Magnussen is some a top driver. Realistically he's in the bottom half of the grid. Hulk has been consistently faster and better in the last two years while himself not being in the same league as the top drivers. The grid today is arguably the most talented in history.\n\nBut the final nail in the coffin for Mick's F1 career is that both Mercedes and Williams have his data and he isn't being considered by either Toto or Vowels and they can see his level better than us. So no, he doesn't deserve to be on the grid but will make a good WEC driver.""]",0,81,0.26,0,74,74,0,81,0.26,0
