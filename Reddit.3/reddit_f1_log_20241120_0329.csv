1guz22f,Why is George beating or matching Lewis for 2 seasons out of 3 so overlooked?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1guz22f/why_is_george_beating_or_matching_lewis_for_2/,2024-11-19, Discussion,"Seriously, unless we agree that Lewis is basically nowhere near his prime level, then why is Russell not getting any credit for what he’s doing.

Yet people act like he’s merely a top midfield driver, worse than the likes of Leclerc, Sainz, or Norris. But then people like to think Lewis will go on to suddenly be super competitive with supposedly a superior driver to George next year, Leclerc.

I think George is the most underrated driver on the grid right now because people do not like him. Lewis is a top 3 driver of all time at worst, so where does that put George talent wise? 

Sure, people always go about “experimental setups” or “Lewis is just unmotivated”, but, I’m sorry, that’s just a cop-out. Then we can just argue endlessly that basically no driver is worse than another driver, since there could always be intangibles like that, “oh, he just doesn’t care about driving in midfield cars”. really? 


I think George is at least Leclerc level. Leclerc got a lot more credit for beating Vettel in 2019, and Vettel is not close to Lewis in driving skill. So why the discrepancy? I think it’s just that people overlook George because they don’t like him on a personal level","[""I think people notice it, but it's hard put value on it with the merc being so all over the place with its performance.

Good to hear that they are also considering to raise the weight limit to accommodate the cooling system into the adjustments.

Lewis Hamilton\'s successor will have a big challenge ahead of him in 2025, in which he must prove that he is one of the great future promises of motorsport.\n\nAfter an undeniable success in lower categories, with the exception of Formula 2, Antonelli will land in the Grand Circus in 2025 in a top-level seat at Mercedes. Although the brand of the star is not going through its best sporting moment, it is clear that they are betting heavily on him by choosing him as Hamilton\'s successor.\n\nAt 18 years old and in his first Formula 1 season, they will have to be patient with the young Italian, but Antonelli wants to make noise from the beginning. For 2025, he knows that his head-to-head with Russell will be very important and for that very reason, he arrives with a clear objective, which is to beat his teammate.\n\n""That great speed, I had it from the beginning. I struggled a bit at the start with the pace, but after a test at Spa they saw a clear step forward and they were convinced. I have a good relationship with George, he hasn\'t given me much advice, but for now, it\'s all good. Next year, I want to beat him,"" said Antonelli in an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport.\n\nAntonelli and Russell will enter 2025 with some doubts about what might happen at Mercedes in the medium to long term. Toto Wolff continues to make no secret of his desire to sign Max Verstappen and despite his repeated assurances that he has confidence in his two talents, the weight of an arguably four-time world champion may tip the balance in his favour.\n\nAlthough in the event of Verstappen\'s arrival Antonelli\'s future is less in jeopardy, the Italian cannot afford to fall too far behind Russell in order to avoid sowing uncertainty about his prospects. It will be an important year for him, in which he will have the pressure of racing a top level car and at the same time, the pressure of facing a tremendously fast teammate without a contract for 2026.\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)', ""Just in: Antonelli's second f1 goal is beating everyone else"", 'first goal: complete a session without crashing', 'Good goal.\n\nI mean, that’s pretty standard for every new teammate that comes into a team.', 'Need bro to turn into Mercedes Ocon 🗿', 'I like antonelli lets see how long it lasts']",185,71,0.88,185,64,64,8,0,0.0,8

1gv408r,Should penalties consider consequences?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gv408r/should_penalties_consider_consequences/,2024-11-19, Discussion,"It's often argued that F1 penalties are applied based on the bahavior but not the consequences. But that makes no sense. 

A very minor collision can have catastrophic consequences, or very minor ones. A deliberate lunge at a hairpin can miss another car or skewer it. Moving several times under braking might have no impact but might cause another car to slide off into the barriers. 

Sometimes actions are premeditated e.g. ""I'll knock him off at the first corner to win the championship"" but the punishment is only for the collision, not the loss of a championship.

If you have a driving offence on the road, the actions and the consequences are considered. Drinking and driving crimes and sentences are different if you just wobble in your lane or if you kill 3 people. Murder is different if premeditated or in the heat of the moment or even in self defence.

It's not enough that they punish for the simple action and nothing else, intent and outcome should be considered too.","[""The intent of penalties is to dissuade driving in a way that the sport (thru the rules) has agreed is unwanted/unsafe. Whether or not the action kills someone, causes minor damage, or has literally no impact at all doesn't change the fact that the sport wants to discourage those actions, because they COULD cause injury/damage in other instances. If there are niche stipulations for each rule you'd never have consistency in stewarding (I know I know, we already don't) and you'd make penalties become perceived as more personal than procedural. \n\nI get the intent of your question but I think we're better off with cut-and-dry flat penalties based on the actions, not the consequences. The flip side is something like the penalty on Bearman in Brazil when he tapped the back of Colapinto, Colapinto was fine and had no (evident) damage but Bearman spun and went to the back, then still got a penalty for causing a collision. But no solution will ever be perfect."", ""It will promote more reckless behaviour. Someone might try a lunge with the mentality that if they manage to miss, they will they'll be clear of a penalty, even if the move was dangerous."", 'Because penalties are supposed to be quick. If we start evaluating intent and outcome you need a whole court case every time. \n\nOutcome should not be considered. It’s the right way. Intent is always established as you are only allowed to drive in a controlled manner. Intent to crash can be provided after and result in a race ban. Very hard to prove though.', ""I mean, it's a tough one, even for the FIA. Even if they say they don't, they already give out penalties based on the consequences. There are so many examples. Ideally every incident should be treated in isolation, but drivers don't drive that way. Drivers know the consequences of their actions, whether it's a championship battle or a fight for P16, and maybe there is some merit in considering that."", '>But that makes no sense.\n\nNo. What makes no sense is to wait and see what the consequences are to be able to mete out a proper penalty. If you cause a collision, like Alonso did in Austria, he needs to get a penalty that causing a collision entails, which is 10 seconds, which he got. That it made no difference for either driver is completely irrelevant if causing a collision is not allowed.', ""Yes.\n\nIf a championship is on the line, the penalty factors in consequences, as they stated before Abu Dhabi 2021.\n\nIf you need to throw the old rules out the window when things get serious, it's a clear indication that the old rules are terrible and not fit for purpose.\n\nThe entire point of penalties is to have consequences, if they don't have meaningful consequences and don't change behaviour and drivers would rather take penalties than not do what they did, then clearly the rules have failed."", 'Penalties should balance actions and consequences. Ignoring outcomes feels unfair when a minor mistake ruins someone’s race, but over-focusing on them could discourage fair racing. Intent and impact both matter.', 'Are there penalties which result in a points deduction?', 'I like some aspects of how it\'s handled in hockey... if I hit you in the face with a high stick, I get a penalty. If I draw blood, the penalty is doubled. I would expect that there could be some ""impact driven factors"" that could play into what penalty is assessed in F1, too.']",0,17,0.41,0,16,16,0,0,0.009999999999999953,0
