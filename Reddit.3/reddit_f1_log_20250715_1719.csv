How do **you** pronounce rawe ceek? Is ""rawe""

* raw (silent e)
* RAH-we / rah-WE (long e)
* RAH-way / rah-WAY (italian e)
* RAW-eh (thanks u/WussssPoppinJimbo )
* RAW-uh (thanks u/AintNoUniqueUsername )
* rave (thanks u/Witchdemigoddess )
* reyw (thanks u/ln4thegreat and u/abraxasnl )
* RAY-weh (thanks u/achterkant )

Is ""ceek""

* seek (soft c)
* keek (hard c)
* cheek (italian ce)
* creek (thanks u/TheKennyAlmighty )
* chick (thanks u/PaddyTheMedic )
* sheek (thanks u/uucchhiihhaa )

As a native English speaker I've always only said ""raw seek"" but now that I think about it ""RAH-way cheek"" sounds more authentic.

Interesting podcast with Tim Mayer whose standing for the presidency of the FIA. Really interesting to hear his opinions on so many elements of our sport as he sets out his pitch for president. ","['>he sets out his pitch for president\n\nAnd that is really what this is all about: marketing. This is all about Mayer making a pitch to the public about his candidacy, and the interviewer does not challenge on anything or ask any follow-up questions. For instance, Mayer says ""there was the World Councils, World Motorsport Council, the World Mobility Council and those two have been seriously impacted by the current administration"" -- but he does not explain *how* those councils have been affected or what he will do to address that problem. He just says that they have been, and then immediately contradicts himself by talking about how ben Sulayem has been supporting smaller federations and how he himself agrees with this policy.\n\nThen Mayer goes on to talk about the non-disclosure agreements. He says that anyone who breaks it can be fined 50,000 Euros and the FIA do not need to prove that you broke the agreement to issue the fine. So how do they know how to fine? It seems that the implication here is that the FIA will go around fining people left, right and centre, but there has been no evidence of that and the interviewer does not ask him to explain this statement. The only way they could fine you is if you made public statements about the thing you agreed not to discuss, which would make it a slam dunk.\n\nFinally, the interviewer does not challenge Mayer over his actions in Austin where he was advising the event organisers on how to appeal their penalty for the track invasion. Since he was in a senior role in the FIA at the time, this was a massive conflict of interests -- and worse, his actions put the FIA in legal jeopardy. If civil or criminal action was brought in the aftermath of the invasion, and Mayer successfully got the penalty reworded to exonerate the organisers for their failings in a key area of responsibility, then it would effectively say that the FIA allowed the invasion to happen.\n\nThis is not an interview, This is propaganda. Mayer screwed up and lost his job, and is pissed about it so he is running for FIA President. And because ben Sulayem is unpopular, he has found a platform where he is allowed to make broad, sweeping statements that are completely shallow, and he allowed to make them without any critical questioning of his policies.', ""F1's dedicated down-under fact checker is back on the case!"", ""I am not sure if you are being sarcastic. I will choose to believe that you are not.\n\nMy objection to this stems from the way everyone is so dissatisfied at ben Sulayem's leadership that they are taking any opportunity to convince themselves that his days are numbered -- but there are so many problems with Mayer as a candidate that those same people are just setting themselves up for disappointment."", 'Between Hitler and Bush, if you had to choose one, you would probably choose Bush, no?

Gerhard Berger sees Red Bull\'s priorities elsewhere than in the World Championship battle.***\n\nThe dismissal of Christian Horner after 20 years at the helm of Red Bull Racing has not only surprised Formula 1. There is also unrest within the team – after all, despite all the internal power struggles, the Briton was the face of the success story. What does his departure mean for the future of superstar Max Verstappen?\n\nFormer Formula 1 driver Gerhard Berger has a clear opinion on this. In an interview with the Kronen Zeitung, the Austrian gives Red Bull surprisingly clear advice on how to keep the Dutch world champion happy.\n\n**Verstappen loyal – but not at any price**\n\nRumours of a possible move by Verstappen have been rife in recent weeks, especially after his yacht was spotted by chance in Sardinia next to that of Mercedes boss Toto Wolff.\n\nBerger dismisses this: ‘That was a coincidence. Max has always emphasised that he wants to remain loyal to Red Bull – and I think he will continue to do so even after Horner\'s dismissal.’\n\nAt the same time, however, the Tyrolean also believes that Horner was never a close confidant of Verstappen: ‘The relationship between the Verstappens and Horner was not the best, as is well known. His departure could even be a decisive factor in Max\'s decision to stay.’\n\n**Red Bull in crisis: ‘Take your foot off the gas!’**\n\nBerger is not surprised that Horner himself was apparently taken aback by the harshness of the decision: ‘You could see that things were heading in this direction. If Horner didn\'t recognise that, it\'s not a good sign.’\n\nThis makes it all the more important for Red Bull not to set the wrong priorities now. Berger warns: ""The focus must not be on winning the world championship again immediately. The most important thing is to stabilise the team and reintegrate Verstappen properly. Red Bull is clearly in a downward spiral – it\'s now a matter of rebuilding effectively.""\n\nOne thing is clear: with new boss Laurent Mekies, a new era is beginning at Red Bull. Whether Verstappen and Red Bull will shape it together depends, according to Berger, on how well the team manages to regroup after the power struggle.\n\n*Translated with* [*DeepL.com*](https://www.deepl.com/?utm_campaign=product&utm_source=web_translator&utm_medium=web&utm_content=copy_free_translation) *(free version)*', ""How reliable is this?

And I am inclined to believe that timeline.\n\nedit: after checking with the original [source ](https://archive.is/y2gKs)(Bild in german), they did not mean the Tuesday before the British gp, they meant the Tuesday after. So they fucked up the copy paste.\n\n>It was reported that Horner’s previously stellar relationship with Yoovidhya had soured after Horner had shown a lack of interest in overseeing additional areas of the organisation, including its marketing and technical operations departments, as well as its powertrains department.\n\nNot sure exactly how to read that, if anything, Horners' interest in concentrating power on himself may have been a factor. But maybe that is what they mean.\n\nEdit: similar here, original source says Yoovidhya had to pressure Horner into conceding at least some of the power, not that Horner showed a lack of interest in overseeing these things."", 'Just fyi, you don’t actually have to repost every click bait article you run across', 'Well I want my five minutes back.

Auch beim Schwester-Team, den Racing Bulls, hatte er bei letzterem den Vorsitz. Horner gab den Posten aber vor Kurzem auf – allerdings nicht freiwillig.\nNach Informationen von BILD wollte der Brite – trotz der Bitte seiner Vorgesetzten – das Marketing weiterführen.
