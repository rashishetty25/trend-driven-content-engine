Managing Director Peter Bayer reveals that the pilot was not entirely innocent at the hanging part.*\n\n\n*That a driver has to leave a team in the middle of the season is not everyday history in Formula 1. If it is also a driver who has 257 Grands Prix under his belt and was able to celebrate eight victories, then the excitement is especially great. And so, of course, those responsible for Toro Rosso had to answer a lot of questions when the first rumors about an imminent expulsion of Daniel Ricciardo surfaced in Singapore.*\n\n\n*But no one from the leadership officially wanted to confirm the farewell. Even the driver himself did not want to know that it could be his last appearance in the premier class. Instead, an attempt was made to make the race weekend quite normal. But the longer the hanging part dragged on with the evasive statements of the participants, the clearer it became to everyone in the paddock that a great career is coming to an end here.*\n\n\n*When the separation was finally made official with a week’s delay, a lot of criticism hit the team. Ricciardo had been denied the chance to celebrate a proper farewell to Formula 1 and the fans, was the accusation. The secrecy was not worthy of a pilot like Ricciardo.*\n\n\n*Team boss Laurent Mekies admitted at the next race in Austin that they were not happy with how the weekend went: “We could have handled it differently, or maybe even should have done it.” In the meantime, it was known that everyone involved knew about the impending separation before the Singapore weekend. But Mekies did not want to go into more detail about why they did not play with open cards.*\n\n\n\n*Only Peter Bayer brings some light into the dark. When asked by auto motor and sport, the managing director revealed that it was not the team’s idea to delay the announcement for so long: “We had agreed with Daniel that we would not communicate it. We knew we’d look a bit old as a team. But we also did this to protect the driver. It was his wish.”*\n\n\n*According to Bayer, Ricciardo had hoped until the end that another miracle would happen. “He believed until the end that he would drive in the front of the qualifying and show it to everyone. I have never seen such a mental strength that this person has in an athlete. And I’ve been to many sports.”*\n\n\n*But the miracle unfortunately did not take place. Ricciardo could no longer pull the rudder. His fate was sealed. “That was a terrible moment, as he was eliminated in Q1. You already heard on the radio that a world has collapsed for him,” Bayer recalls. “We then talked to him again on Saturday. We sat together in our office at two o’clock in the morning and asked him how we were supposed to do it now. He then told us to just let him do the race. He just didn’t want a fuss.”*\n\n\n*In the end, Ricciardo was allowed to finish the Formula 1 chapter with the fastest race lap. But there were no world championship points. And also not a solemn farewell. Bayer regrets this, but also sees no alternative way: “We have stood in front of him as a team. If Daniel had driven to Abu Dhabi, then of course the farewell would have been celebrated with fireworks and photo on the grid, just like with Räikkönen back then. That’s what everyone would have liked.”*\n\n\n*According to Bayer, however, one should not forget that Ricciardo’s career would have ended before without Red Bull. “We gave him another chance that no one thought possible.” The relationship between the ex-driver and the team is still good. According to Bayer, there is still regular contact between Ricciardo and team boss Mekies. “It was important for us that at the end of the day we could look in the mirror and say that we did it right. Even if the whole world and its nine million Instagram fans are beating us up.”*', 'A lot more respect for the team with this information now, that he chose this and they took the heat to honor his choice.

I keep hearing about 2026 being the year in which new regulations will apply, and this appears to mean fundamentally redesigned cars? 

My question is: Given that, this year, it’s been quite competitive between a few teams in terms of car performance, will next year’s 2025 season be likely to be similar? That is, if next year’s regulations are similar, then presumably the teams (focussing on 2026), will be applying moderate improvements to the existing cars for 2025, rather than entirely new designs?

Additionally, does anyone know yet how different the cars might have to be under the new, upcoming regulations?

I’m curious because I’ve found the last few months really exciting with all the different teams/drivers that have been able to win and I’d like that to continue!","['2025 will likely carry on being super close - unless one team would decide to do the opposite and instead sacrifice 2026 a bit to go for a better car this year. However they wouldn’t necessarily even succeed these cars are so tricky to develop. So in all likelihood 2025 will look similar to this year. However 2026 will have so many changes to Aero and Power units that there’s a good chance one team will get it way better than the rest and lead the way. However we really have no idea what 2026 will look like.', 'Big change for 2026 is moveabe aerodynamics, both the front and rear wings will be able to move between 2 modes for top speed and grip.\n\nMuch more power coming from the electrical energy with a 50/50 split between fuel and battery power.\n\nCars slightly smaller, 8 inches shorter, 4 inches narrower, 30kg lighter.\n\nRear wings will have traditional endplates rather than the current curved single profile.\n\n30% less downforce and 55% less drag. \n\nMove away from ground effect to over body aero.\n\nAs regards 2025, as you get to a mature set of regulations things usually close up as teams converge on the best solutions and the rule of diminishing returns means there is less time to be found.\n\nSo expect it to be even closer than this season with potentially more teams joining the battle at the front.', "">presumably the teams (focussing on 2026), will be applying moderate improvements to the existing cars for 2025, rather than entirely new designs?\n\nNo, you can expect each team to design a completely new car for next year. There are certain changes that the teams cannot apply to an existing car, such as the cooling layout and homologated parts like impact structures, so it's better to start from a clean sheet. \n\nAlso, teams can only start working on the 2026 car from the 1st of January onward, so they don't have to compromise on either year's car.
