However, the four-ringed manufacturer, which is preparing for its F1 debut in 2026, is playing an underdog role in the sport.\n\nMattia Binotto, Head of Audi F1 Project, has launched a five-year plan aimed at winning in 2030. In an interesting interview with Autosprint, the former Ferrari engineer outlined an intriguing scenario: “F1 is the most complex sport, and not just in motorsport. This is due to its size and technology. History teaches us that all winning cycles are based on a preparation period of five to seven years. We want to do it in five years: three to build and two to consolidate.”\n\nThe picture is clear, but it's fair to say that Sauber's transformation into Audi has been underway for some time, and the Ingolstadt brand isn't approaching Grand Prix racing like Cadillac, which is building its team from scratch. The Swiss team has abandoned last place in the Constructors' Championship, putting itself in a position to score points with both drivers, so there's an objective perception of growth. Meanwhile, no one talks about the Audi Motorsport Competence Center, which has been based in Neuburg an der Donau, Germany, since 2014.\n\nFour Rings have developed their engine department: Neuburg an der Donau is where the Audi R18 e-tron for the WEC was born, the Audi RS Q e-tron that raced and won the Dakar, not to mention the Audi RS 5 DTM or the management of the Formula E single-seater. We're talking, therefore, about a center of excellence that has had to adapt to the needs of F1. The facility has been expanded, and the staff has multiplied, drawn from Mercedes and Ferrari where there is more experience and knowledge.\n\nAccording to paddock rumors, the most likely power unit at this stage is the Mercedes one, which will power the Brackley-based factory team, along with McLaren, Williams, and Alpine. There are high expectations for Ferrari, which boasts a great engine tradition, and there's anticipation for Honda's partnership with Aston Martin, but almost no one knows anything about Audi and Red Bull Powertrains by Ford.\n\nFerrari, after abandoning a highly innovative steel cylinder head proposed by Zimmermann because it failed to meet the expected reliability standards, settled on an aluminum alloy solution featuring a revolutionary and highly secretive intake system. The lost time, of course, took its toll, and the engineers led by Enrico Gualtieri found themselves somewhat trailing Mercedes, with Honda not far behind.\n\nAnd, in any case, Audi, at least initially, will struggle to bring together the two souls of the team (Hinwil and Neuburg), but it is reasonable to think that the starting point for becoming a truly top team will be higher than what we can imagine in simply transposing Sauber into an official team."", 'I was here for the hulkenpodium']",781,167,0.98,781,157,157,357,53,-0.010000000000000009,357

There were issues then (different tyre companies that could practically determine who could win and who could not in some years or races) there are other issues now (dirty air with the development of aerodynamics), there was fuel strategy before there's active aerodynamics now.\n\nThe grid is much closer today, there aren't teams who actually risk of not making the 107% at least.\n\nWhat F1 had until like a decade ago that is declining is more frequent mechanical failures, which could shake up the grid or the championship battle.\n\nThe sources are F1TV if available where you are from what I've heard (I don't personally have it), internet archives too.\n\n\nSome favourite races off the top of my head:\n\n* Monaco 1961 - Moss' greatest drive, one of the best editions of the Monaco GP (there are highlights, not the full race)\n* Italy 1976 (Monza) - one of the greatest sports comebacks\n* Sweden 1978 (Anderstorp) - one-off for the fan car\n* France 1979 (Dijon) - best battle ever?\n* Monaco 1982 - the race nobody wanted to win\n* Monaco 1984 - rookie's masterclass in the rain\n* Europe 1993 (Donington Park) - lap of gods\n* Monaco 1996 - chaos start on wet track\n* Spain 1996 (Catalunya) - one of the Kaiser's best\xa0\n* Europe 1999 (Nürburgring GP) - chaos GP\xa0\n* France 2004 (Magny-Cours) - for the strategy\xa0\n* Japan 2005 (Suzuka) - one of the greatest comebacks ever\n* Europe 2012 (Valencia) - a masterclass in starting and driving\xa0\n* Austria 2019 (Red Bull Ring) - nice fight for the victory\xa0\n* Germany 2019 (Hockenheimring) - one of the best wet races to date\n* Sakhir 2020 (Sakhir) - one of the greatest comebacks in recent years\n* Hungary 2021 (Hungaroring) - the weirdest start ever (even more than Indy 2005)\n\n\nNot strictly racing, but I'd also advice to watch archive footage of testing too, there's one of Fangio driving the 250F around the Modena Autodrome or there's one where Castellotti is driving the D50 in Spa."", ""Different is my answer, they are different to how they used to be. Some things more exciting and some things less exciting.\n\n* Reliability - races in the 90s were punctuated by wildly unrpedicatable relaibility, cars could and would break down at any moment, no race result was ever safe until you crossed the line\n* Lack of on track action - races in the 90s often were decided in the pitlane, particularly once refueling came in, it was easier to pass in the pits than on track... so cars did\n* Field Spread - the field spread in the 90s was huge, the gaps between the front few cars and even the lower end of the top 6 could be over a second a lap, cars were being lapped within the first 10 laps and would be lapped 4 times a race, F1 now is closer than it has ever been in it's history\n* Points down to 6th place - Points only being given to 6th palce made it a real achievement to score any, but this is somewhat balanced out by the unreliability meaning it was possible for any team to score points on a given day if luck is on their side\n* Driving Standards - The drivers generally are much much better today through the field. Not saying Verstappen is better than Senna or anything, but the midfield and backmarkers are leagues above what we had in the 90s. Meaning less silly collisions and drivers chucking it at the scenery\n* Difficulty of driving the cars - 90s cars were more 'alive' and more difficult to drive at the pace required in races, this would result in more mistakes from drivers\n* Less 'management' - Races now involve a lot of tire management, in the 90s this was less of a thing and races were more flat out sprints punctuated by pit stops\n* Professionalism - F1 now is far far more professional which results in less unpredicatability as less just plain amateur hour stuff happens"", 'Closer gaps between cars, much better reliability, but also more predictable in many ways.\n\nThe tech guys are really maximizing things, getting the cars close on performance and running optimal strategies.', ""In my opinion, the biggest misconception is that Formula 1 races have become boring in recent years.  \nFrom a racing perspective alone, it's arguably the worst series around.   \nIt has always been more like a game of chess at 300 kph.  \nPast races perhaps felt more exciting because an element that has now been minimised was more prevalent: Reliability and technical failures.   \nThese failures added an extra element of unpredictability — I still haven't got over Michael's engine failure at Suzuka in 2006.  \nIf you don't believe me, watch a race from the '90s or '00s.   \nSome seasons were so dull that, in 2005, the FIA introduced tyres that needed to last the whole race in an attempt to end Ferrari's domination.  \nIf you have F1 TV, the archive is a great source."", ""I'd say that it's more engaging as a whole since we have a larger scope of media coverage,both on and off track.\n\nSome races are boring as heck. Some are wonderful.\n\nBot the whole thing is wonderful."", ""I think there's probably more overtaking and the grid is closer, but I loved the variety we used to get in the 90s vs today's tightly specified cars, and the number of races made each one feel much more important."", ""Depends on what you value. The era you're talking about cars were widely divergent performance wise, was mired in unreliability and it genuinely caused tension all the way to the end, like Damon Hill's arrows shitting itself in 1997 at the Hungaroring, Panis winning Monaco where only 3 cars finished the race etc. I enjoyed this era most but it's personal preferences ofcourse. Where to watch? Not sure if the F1 app would have it, but personally I have like every race since the 80s recorded in on way or another. My dad taped most of this stuff and I digitized the stuff i cared about."", ""they're just very different, on average I wouldn't say they're any more fun or more boring than in the 90s"", 'Boring is the wrong word, but I think races have become very predictable. Teams are too good at what they do, cars are too reliable and DRS is too much of an equalizer imo.']",0,56,0.29,0,55,55,0,6,0.0,0
