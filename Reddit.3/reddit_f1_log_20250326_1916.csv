Hulkenberg completely lost the rear on seemingly normal acceleration on the exit of T3/4, having to save multiple severe oversteer moments that put him into the gravel, damaging his floor and effectively ending his race. Later on in the lap, Bortoleto was in a battle with Bearman, and turned in relatively normally into T8 and instantly lost the rear in a basically unsavable moment that put him into the gravel, taking him out of race contention as well.

Both of these moments can be viewed here: [https://youtu.be/xY2yw7z\_2yk?si=SVezDkAevbN8oQeH&t=68](https://youtu.be/xY2yw7z_2yk?si=SVezDkAevbN8oQeH&t=68)

If one of these drivers had experienced this alone, it would be easy to put it down to driver error. However, the appearance of a similar issue on both cars in the first lap in seemingly innocuous moments when the drivers weren't even trying to make a move, leads me to believe that there was potentially some sort of issue on the car, or more specifically, the tyre preparation plan that the team had in place during the formation lap (ie number of burnouts, target tyre temp).

I have read that Tsunodas driving style is sharp and quick preferring a pointy front end and loose rear. he is also very late and aggressive on breaking. The main difference is being that he lacks the smoothness and a robotic precision that Verstappen has but he has good reflexes. 

From what Ive seen, it seems like Yuki’s driving style is a more ""staccato"" version of of Verstappen. With that being said is Yuki not more well placed to develop into a better teammate?

That makes it difficult to wrangle into some good pace. Max has reported the car oversteers and understeers basically from corner to corner.

1jk395q,Could Leclerc go Down as One of the Best Drivers to Never Win a WDC?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jk395q/could_leclerc_go_down_as_one_of_the_best_drivers/,2025-03-26, Discussion,"Given the last decade or two have felt like f1's ""dominance era"" so many great drivers have started, ended, and driven most of their careers in a car that can barely win a race, let alone a championship.

Some big names with great primes that come to mind for me are Ricciardo and Massa. Granted, I haven't been watching as far back as their primes so I wouldn't know, but it truly feels like we have another uncrowned Champion in the making. 

Charles might have had mistakes earlier in his career but it really feels like he ironed them out last season and performs every race week. It's only early in his career but its possible we'll never see him lift the WDC Trophy despite being apparently more deserving than other names like Russel, Norris, or Piastri.

What are your thoughts? Could Charles go down as one of the best to never do it?

David Coulthard was memed quite a lot but he was very good. Kubica had the talent and could've have a very realistic chance if not for the accident... Rubens Barrichello could've been another one if it wasn't for him having to live next to The Michael.\n\nI'd like to also say Martin Brundle who was incredibly fast but never even won a race... dude was always at the wrong place at the wrong time. \n\nAlso worth noting Alonso could've had a few more titles in his name if it wasn't, again, for being in the wrong place at the wrong time."", 'I still believe he’ll win it eventually, he’s only 27 and he’ll stick around as long as possible for a chance at a title.

1jkijpw,Why can't the RB car be adjusted to fit Liam Lawson?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jkijpw/why_cant_the_rb_car_be_adjusted_to_fit_liam_lawson/,2025-03-26, Discussion,"So this might be a dumb question, and I will admit right off the bat that I don't know a lot about the rules and regulations. But I keep hearing that the RB car is designed to fit Max's driving style which is a super pointy and sensitive front end, fair enough.

But why isn't this adjustable? Is it because both cars have to be exactly the same?

Follow up question: What actually makes the car more ""front end pointy""?","['an F1 car isnt something you can play with. They are high precision tools. A car is design is fundamental to the chassis. The car is designed around aero load on the front of the chassis. There is no setup that can make that not true. Anything you do will just be making it a worse version of what it was designed to do. This is why you often hear teams like Mercedes say they cant make larger changes until they can get a new chassis. The actual car is simply designed to operate in one way. Then you build in as much room to alter things within that actual design.', 'One thing we have to remember is Red Bull is privy to a lot more data than we are.', 'Way to hard to build two different cars.', ""I wouldn't get my technical insight from reddit.  That's probably a question for RB engineers.\n\nThere are definitely adjustments they can make on the cars to adjust the balance in the direction of more or less oversteer, but since car dynamics are a complex beast that's going to have implications on what a driver can get out of the car.  As Albon said in that interview, Max can handle a setup that's both edgier and makes him go faster."", 'Because the car is made to be the quickest it can be at the factory and then it’s up to the drivers to achieve that.

Red Bull puts their juniors up in the same block of flats in Milton Keynes, so you’d see them on stream together (same with Vips before his gamer moment). \n\nI think a lot of the shit talk is media saying half of a quote to them mixed in with the obvious conflict over both wanting that seat. \n\nTsunoda was asked whether he’s ready to take the seat. He said 100%. Reasonable question, reasonable answer. He was asked if he’d do better than Lawson in the RB21 in China, he said he didn’t drive in it in China so he doesn’t know but he didn’t feel he was too far off Max in his Abu Dhabi test.\n\nLawson was told ‘Yuki is saying he’s ready to take your seat’ and Lawson has hit back saying ‘Well actually I beat him in juniors and F1 so he can say what I want’. Lawson was probably a bit sensitive considering everyone was talking about him coming P20 twice and clearly struggling and the reporters have used the exact thing that would provoke him.\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see how they go.

Lawson’s been more defensive in his recent comments about deserving the seat “he’s had his time, now it’s my time” and saying he beat Yuki in the junior series, he has no sympathy for Yuki getting passed over but I think that’s just due to the pressure and him trying to be all like i’m not here to feel bad for others/make friends i’m here to win etc.', ""Both competing for the same competitive seat and a little bit of history from their junior days.
