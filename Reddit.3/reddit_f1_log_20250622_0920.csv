1lhierk,Go to F1 podcasts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lhierk/go_to_f1_podcasts/,2025-06-22, Discussion,"I have watched formula 1 since around 94, and in the last few years have discovered podcasts, initially it was WTF1, as I liked Matt and Tommys bants, and have followed them over to P1. I know theyâ€™re not professional journalists by any stretch but theyâ€™re clearly fans, like myself, who donâ€™t take it too seriously.

My next one is MissedApex, though this one has a fluctuating panel, so depending on whoâ€™s on Iâ€™ll be honest depends if I listen to that episode or not, some of the panel I just canâ€™t take to and are sometimes a little too biased towards their favourite drivers, but thatâ€™s to be expected really.

I used to listen to the Race, but I feel it was maybe too serious for myself, felt more like professional journalists rather than fans having the bants, but my question is, does anyone have any they canâ€™t miss and would recommend?","['Beyond the grid is great, they do episodes with drivers, TPs, engineers and ex drivers and really have great insight.
