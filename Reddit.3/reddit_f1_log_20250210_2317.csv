It has been a very long time, almost 4 years, since our last round of moderator recruitment. Back then we were only at 1.5 million members. Since then not only has the subreddit tripled in size, but after the 2023 Reddit Blackout multiple members of the mod team had left and since then the rest of us had also come close to being burnt out. So with all that and with an exciting 2025 season on the horizon it's time for a new round of moderator recruitment.

The qualifications to become a moderator are very simple:

* be a motorsports fan
* use reddit

The expectations for the new moderators are to be transparent, to be communicative and to be reasonably active. We have a guideline of 300 mod actions per month, but don't let this stop you from applying. **Real life always comes before Reddit** and just let the rest of the team know if you need a break.

After the form is closed we will evaluate the applications, compile a shortlist and invite those candidates to an interview. The interview will be conducted as an audio or video call. After the interview we will make the final selection of moderators and we hope to be able to onboard them by the Japanese GP at the start of April.

The applications will close on the 22nd of February at 23:00 UTC

[**Link to the application form**](https://forms.gle/gHS5HKHDWNbpJzXs8)

If you have any questions or doubts feel free to ask in the comments.

# FAQ

* **What timezones are you looking for mods from?**
   * We're looking for mods from all timezones
* **What do you use for communication between the team?**
   * Slack
* **Should I apply if I applied in previous rounds?**
   * Yes. It has been 4 years!
* **Do you need to have moderation experience?**
   * No, it's not an issue if you don't have moderator experience yet.
* **What are the tasks of a moderator exactly?**
   * Obviously the primary task is going through the modqueue and removing comments and posts that go against the subreddit rules. But there are other aspects like configuring automoderator, working on graphics and flairs, maintaining source ratings, external relations (Teams & Journalists for AMAs, etc), social media and so on.

&#x200B;

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

&#x200B;

GOOD LUCK AND MAY THE TRASH TALK BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOUR.

With the launch of Reiss Season 2 Mclaren release (Some stuff looks really cool) one of the jackets has a couple of clear kiwi's on the front.  
Another Jacket I am really keen on. I was talking to my friend about it. Not an F1 fan as long as myself but big fan for over a decade himself.

I said ""Its nice to have the clear representation, the kiwi in the logo is to simple.""   
And he was like ""whaaaat?""  
While he knew Mclaren origins were New Zealand he did not know the shape in the logo was a kiwi. I had to show him the older logo's for him to get it.

So it got me thinking, how many people do not know what that shape was?
