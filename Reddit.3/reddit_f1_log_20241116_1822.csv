No. Brocedes has already proved it to us.', 'Norris gets in his own head. \n\nHe says he respects Max but is unsure if Max respects him. lol \n\nYou can perfectly respect a driver and still be ruthless. The fact Norris sees the way Max races him as a compliment says a lot. Max raced Hamilton like his racing life depended on it because that’s what it took.\n\nMax doesn’t need to be driving on the edge because he doesn’t have anyone pushing him. It’s a back handed compliment, Norris. 😭', 'Could it be that the only thing that really changed is that now Lando knows having the fastest car is not the only reason why max was better in the previous years? It is easy to be friends with someone when you feel you are on the same level. Gets harder when you start realising that the other guy is just plain better than you.', ""As Lando himself said, time will tell.   \n  \nPeople like to point to Hamilton vs. Rosberg but I think that was a more complex situation. They were both at the same team, which already raises a slew of additional questions regarding strategies, updates, preferential treatment, etc. They also competed against each other for decades, which created this dynamic where Rosberg was desperate to finally get one over on Hamilton even if it meant the end of their friendship.\n\nLando is also a bit of a unique personality in the sport. At times he appears to be very emotional, sometimes to the point of self-detriment. So the Lando we hear and see on a Sunday does not necessarily hold the same views as the Lando who gets interviewed a few days after the race. Austria was a great example of that. I suspect that, after this season is done and dusted, he'll gain some perspective and have peace with whatever happens.  \n  \nThen next season, the story will start anew, but if McLaren has the faster car from the start, it will also create a different dynamic, as it might mean that Lando will be the one who can afford to risk it all with his defensive driving once he's leading the WDC."", 'It’s kind of funny. For Verstappen it did not really change that much. There has always been a fight mode and a relax mode. He changes state when the helmet is on. That’s the state separation.
