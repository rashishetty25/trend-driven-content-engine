1m0da20,pronouncing rawe ceek?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m0da20/pronouncing_rawe_ceek/,2025-07-15, Discussion,"I looked at my calendar this morning and thought ""still not a rawe ceek"". Then I started wondering how other people pronounce it.

How do **you** pronounce rawe ceek? Is ""rawe""

* raw (silent e)
* RAH-we / rah-WE (long e)
* RAH-way / rah-WAY (italian e)
* RAW-eh (thanks u/WussssPoppinJimbo )
* RAW-uh (thanks u/AintNoUniqueUsername )
* rave (thanks u/Witchdemigoddess )
* reyw (thanks u/ln4thegreat and u/abraxasnl )
* RAY-weh (thanks u/achterkant )

Is ""ceek""

* seek (soft c)
* keek (hard c)
* cheek (italian ce)
* creek (thanks u/TheKennyAlmighty )
* chick (thanks u/PaddyTheMedic )
* sheek (thanks u/uucchhiihhaa )

As a native English speaker I've always only said ""raw seek"" but now that I think about it ""RAH-way cheek"" sounds more authentic.

I only started watching Formula 1 a few seasons ago because of the show. I still get excited and binge it as soon as it premiers.



That said, you need to take the show with a grain of salt. Some of the story lines are churched up for TV excitement. The biggest example that comes to mind from last season is Lando's first win at Miami. The show showed a frustrated Max, but in reality he was excited for Lando and gave us his famous ""If my mom had balls"" quote.","['I am looking forward to the Christian Horner episode.', ""Redbull drama, Hulkenberg's podium, Ferrari doing Ferrari things, and manufactured McLaren driver squabbling. Maybe a rookie ep that ends up focusing on Antonelli mostly."", ""Nico's 1st podium will be mentioned, but the episode won't make any note of his driving skill or Sauber's upgrade packages. It will be dressed up as Lewis' move to Ferrari was bad for business"", 'Hadjar redemption arc from Australia.

Episode ends with Hamilton‚Äôs win in the sprint in China which DTS disguises as the main race in China.\n\nEpisode 2- Crash Course -\xa0\n\n\xa0Obligatory Red Bull second seat episode. Lawson is doing badly and gets kicked out. Squeeze in a bit of Horner and Geri where she recommends he promote Yuki. Yuki is promoted and while we watch Verstappen winning in Japan. Then we have a montage of races and arrive in Imola where they replay Tsunoda‚Äôs Quali crash 63,827,382,882,821 times. Silence falls on a race track etc etc before we close up the episode focusing on his comeback to points in Imola.\n\nEpisode 3- Hot and Cold -\n\n\xa0Episode focusing on the two McLaren drivers battle for the championship. Montage of Norris‚Äôs mistakes from China-Imola (squeeze in some more Tsunoda Imola crash replays) as we arrive in Canada. It tries to paint Norris as James Hunt and Piastri as Niki Lauda. Ends with Norris‚Äôs crash in Canada and paints their battle as the battle for the win. Then we go to Austria where Norris redeemes himself.\n\nEpisode 4- Backstreet Boy -\xa0\n\nObligatory Leclerc Monaco episode. It‚Äôs painted as Leclerc is having a terrible season and Hamilton‚Äôs being great, and Leclerc needs to get out of Lewis‚Äôs shadow.\xa0\n\nEpisode 5 - Sinking Ship -\xa0\n\nHorners sacking from Red Bull plus lots of his home life. Maybe squeeze in some Horner+wife on speedboat or may as well a yacht because why not? Second half of the episode focuses on stuff yet to come\xa0\n\nEpisode 6 - Abandon Ship -\xa0\n\nVerstappen, Russell and Antonelli battle for the Mercedes seats in 2026. Depends on what happens in the future but might include Aston if that‚Äôs where George goes.\xa0\n\nEpisode 7 - You sure Vasseur? -\xa0\n\nObligatory Ferrari at Monza episode.\n\nEpisode 8 - Heights of the Nights out of the Spotlights.\n\nThe heat of Singapore and Williams vs Haas in the midfield. Brings in Gunther as a talking head. Overdramatises the race.\n\nEpisode 9 - Hola Amigo -\xa0\n\nThe epic battle for P14 between South Americans Bortoleto and Colapinto in Brazil. Thats if Colapinto has not been fired by Alpine. If he‚Äôs not the episode will start with his firing before switching to Bortoleto as he navigates how hard it is to be a South American in Formula 1 with flashback scenes to Senna.\xa0\n\nEpisode 10- Civil or War? -\xa0\n\nMcLaren championship battle finale in Las Vegas and Abu Dhabi.\xa0', ""They won't even mention Horner leaving, they will focus on Oscar and the penalty then move to the max drama.
