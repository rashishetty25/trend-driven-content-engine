How do **you** pronounce rawe ceek? Is ""rawe""

* raw (silent e)
* RAH-we / rah-WE (long e)
* RAH-way / rah-WAY (italian e)
* RAW-eh (thanks u/WussssPoppinJimbo )
* RAW-uh (thanks u/AintNoUniqueUsername )
* rave (thanks u/Witchdemigoddess )
* reyw (thanks u/ln4thegreat and u/abraxasnl )
* RAY-weh (thanks u/achterkant )

Is ""ceek""

* seek (soft c)
* keek (hard c)
* cheek (italian ce)
* creek (thanks u/TheKennyAlmighty )
* chick (thanks u/PaddyTheMedic )
* sheek (thanks u/uucchhiihhaa )

As a native English speaker I've always only said ""raw seek"" but now that I think about it ""RAH-way cheek"" sounds more authentic.

The biggest example that comes to mind from last season is Lando's first win at Miami. The show showed a frustrated Max, but in reality he was excited for Lando and gave us his famous ""If my mom had balls"" quote.","['I am looking forward to the Christian Horner episode.', ""Redbull drama, Hulkenberg's podium, Ferrari doing Ferrari things, and manufactured McLaren driver squabbling.

Episode ends with Hamilton’s win in the sprint in China which DTS disguises as the main race in China.\n\nEpisode 2- Crash Course -\xa0\n\n\xa0Obligatory Red Bull second seat episode. Lawson is doing badly and gets kicked out. Squeeze in a bit of Horner and Geri where she recommends he promote Yuki. Yuki is promoted and while we watch Verstappen winning in Japan. Then we have a montage of races and arrive in Imola where they replay Tsunoda’s Quali crash 63,827,382,882,821 times. Silence falls on a race track etc etc before we close up the episode focusing on his comeback to points in Imola.\n\nEpisode 3- Hot and Cold -\n\n\xa0Episode focusing on the two McLaren drivers battle for the championship. Montage of Norris’s mistakes from China-Imola (squeeze in some more Tsunoda Imola crash replays) as we arrive in Canada. It tries to paint Norris as James Hunt and Piastri as Niki Lauda. Ends with Norris’s crash in Canada and paints their battle as the battle for the win. Then we go to Austria where Norris redeemes himself.\n\nEpisode 4- Backstreet Boy -\xa0\n\nObligatory Leclerc Monaco episode. It’s painted as Leclerc is having a terrible season and Hamilton’s being great, and Leclerc needs to get out of Lewis’s shadow.\xa0\n\nEpisode 5 - Sinking Ship -\xa0\n\nHorners sacking from Red Bull plus lots of his home life. Maybe squeeze in some Horner+wife on speedboat or may as well a yacht because why not? Second half of the episode focuses on stuff yet to come\xa0\n\nEpisode 6 - Abandon Ship -\xa0\n\nVerstappen, Russell and Antonelli battle for the Mercedes seats in 2026.

Brings in Gunther as a talking head. Overdramatises the race.\n\nEpisode 9 - Hola Amigo -\xa0\n\nThe epic battle for P14 between South Americans Bortoleto and Colapinto in Brazil. Thats if Colapinto has not been fired by Alpine. If he’s not the episode will start with his firing before switching to Bortoleto as he navigates how hard it is to be a South American in Formula 1 with flashback scenes to Senna.\xa0\n\nEpisode 10- Civil or War? -\xa0\n\nMcLaren championship battle finale in Las Vegas and Abu Dhabi.\xa0', ""They won't even mention Horner leaving, they will focus on Oscar and the penalty then move to the max drama.

And I am inclined to believe that timeline.\n\nedit: after checking with the original [source ](https://archive.is/y2gKs)(Bild in german), they did not mean the Tuesday before the British gp, they meant the Tuesday after.
