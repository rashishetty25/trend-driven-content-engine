1lcgk2t,"Overtaking under a Safety Car, after the race: SC in early, but warnings given?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lcgk2t/overtaking_under_a_safety_car_after_the_race_sc/,2025-06-16, Discussion,"Apparently, per FIA decision, a bunch of F1 drivers are either as liable to autopiloting due to force-of-habit as the rest of us, or were unaware that (per infringement Document 66 through 71 inclusive):

>""While¬†the¬†drivers¬†were¬†aware¬†of¬†where¬†the¬†incident¬†was,¬†they¬†could not¬†have¬†known¬†if¬†emergency¬†equipment¬†or¬†marshals¬†were¬†being¬†dispatched¬†onto¬†the track,¬†and¬†so¬†have¬†to¬†proceed¬†with¬†caution.""

The drivers were pretty much a cross section of abilities and experience levels across the grid, and all got a warning:

* Antonelli
* Piastri
* Ocon
* Leclerc
* Sainz
* Gasly

Clearly, this only goes to show that at the end of an exhausting and hard fought race, tired athlete drivers at the pinnacle of motorsport are every bit as human as the rest of us.

Still, the FIA is correct about what the rules around overtaking under yellows/VSC/SC are  (even after the chequered flag), and why they exist.

Yet, this does make me wonder whether some of the drivers had simply released themselves from the rules of the track in their minds because they simply flipped that mental switch that says that the race is over? After all, the yellows were still waving, and the big electronic flag boards were reading ""SC"".

I also find myself wondering if it was wise to bring in the safety car just before they crossed for the chequered flag? It was clearly brought in earlier than it would have been had there been racing laps left to go, as there were back markers that hadn't been released from the queue yet; though I'm not clear about *why* it was brought in early. In the international commentary, Martin Brundle gave a possible reason when he pointed out:

>""... the safety car will pull in \[at the end of the final lap\], I would assume, because you don't like to see it in front of the cars for the big photo...""

If that *really is* the reason for it, despite the Safety Car still officially being out after the end of the race, I can't help wondering whether that was a good enough reason to bring it in.

Surely, if the drivers overtaking on the slow-speed post-race lap as they return to the pits was ruled sufficiently dangerous to issue them all a warning for overtaking under SC conditions, you've also got to wonder if pulling in the safety car early for a photo is a 'safety-first' approach? I can only imagine that it would only add to the impression that the race was over and encourage the tired drivers to flip that ""job done, now chill"" switch in the back of their minds as per normal?

So, what would others here think?  If a race is ending under a safety car, should the SC stay out though the chequered flag, and the reality of it is as the photos will show, SC and all... or can the drivers really be blamed if they let their minds skip a beat at low speed after a full race distance of being sharp and quick?","['FIA stupidity at it‚Äôs finest. If it‚Äôs all safety first and cars passing at reduced speeds AFTER the race is such a big safety issue, then you shouldn‚Äôt pull in the safety car for a photo op.', 'Wth??!\nYuki got 10grid penalty PLUS Two penalty points in Practice for almost the same thing.', 'This was just dumb overall. If the safety car is still in effect, don‚Äôt pull it into the pit lane ffs. Just finish behind it like we have always done in these situations.', 'If the race ends under a safety car it seems like the post chequered flag process should be like the red flag process (which also says no overtaking as Yuki found out) but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs spelled out like that in the rules', ""I think the drivers probably relaxed because they knew where the dangerous area was, and they were past that area when those overtake happened. There could have been a second incident during the last lap and so they couldn't 100% know there wasn't something else, but I get how they could think that way.

I‚Äôm willing to bet it‚Äôs because they didn‚Äôt want to strip Antonelli off his podium and give Piastri a penalty because they don‚Äôt want to interfere the championship.\n\n(Also the reason why Norris got a random 5s to his time and not a grid drop). Just to re emphasize it, they gave a 5 seconds penalty to a car that was a 5 laps down. That‚Äôs how dumb the penalty was.\xa0', 'I said when the investigation was announced that too many Drivers had been summoned for it to be anything more than a warning - Whether people agree with that decision is a different case entirely, but it shows that the Stewards do have consistency.', 'Great post. I\'ve thought about this every single time a race ends under the safety car. They do this absolutely insane practice of bringing the safety car in on the final lap no matter what in F2 and F3 as well. All the drivers speed up and approach/pass the start finish line, even though it\'s illegal to overtake (cant pass before the start finish line after the SC pulls in). A massive pile up is eventually going to happen when some drivers think ""no need to speed up because there\'s no overtaking"" and some drivers just floor it because the car ahead of them has done so. It\'s an incredibly dangerous practice, especially considering situations where the incident causing the safety car to come out in the first place is near the start/finish straight like what just happened in Canada. \n\nIn fact, you also get even more chances for cars doing different speeds as they head for the start/finish line if any of them have time penalties at the end of the race, as they try to manipulate the gap behind them to make it as big as possible. \n\nI think the 2012 Brazilian GP was the worst offender of this. Paul di Resta crashed on the final run up to the start/finish line in extremely wet conditions on the penultimate lap. The safety car came out for one lap before race control immediately sent the message ""safety car in this lap"" with di Resta and his mangled car, as well as a ton of debris, were still on the track. I mean... wtf! It doesnt get any more dangerous than that! Take it out of the drivers hands and just have the Safety Car slowly lead everyone over the line! On commentary that day, even Martin Brundle was confused when he said ""You CAN overtake after the safety car line, but presumably there will be waved yellow flags there"". This was even after the FIA clarified the rules about what\'s allowed when races end under safety car (due to the controversial ending of the 2010 Monaco grand prix where Michael Schumacher overtook Alonso after the safety car line on the last lap ""restart"").', 'Where is the control line in Canada? Is it because stopping in the pits at the end of the lap would mean some cars never finished? Is it because Jean Alesi needed to wave his special extra flag so they could sell it?']",83,39,0.81,83,35,35,-2,0,0.0,-2

1lbzwpu,What time to arrive at Montreal F1 race with General admission tickets,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lbzwpu/what_time_to_arrive_at_montreal_f1_race_with/,2025-06-15, Discussion,"So I found myself asking myself this very question yesterday: ¬´¬†What time should I arrive at the F1 race at Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve for the Montreal Grand Prix of formula 1?¬†¬ª

My short answer: earlier than 6:30-7:00 am for sure, take the first metro train at 5:30 am if you really want good tickets and be ready to run in any case.

Long answer

The details:
- General admission spots are generally poor visibility unless you are right up against the fence in a few spots on the track.
- I won‚Äôt give all the details of the General Admission experience here because others have explained that well
- The metro opens at 5:30 am.
- The gate opens at 8:30 am according to the official app
- The gate opens at 8:00 am according to the official tickets

What we did:
- Showed up on the Saturday to watch the Saturday races, wander and visit the track. We basically scoped out the grounds Saturday. We did not bring lawn chairs Saturday because it would have been useless while walking around.
On the Sunday:
-Arrived at the metro parking at 6:50
- Arrived at the metro at 6:58
- Arrived on the St Helen‚Äôs island at around 7:05
- Got to the queue at around 7:10 am

At this point, there were about 2000-3000 people in line in front of us. It‚Äôs hard to estimate crowd sizes but I counted about 100 people and then extrapolated from how much space 100 people took. It was definitely more than 1500. We got to sit in our lawn chairs which was fine.

They opened the gates at 8:17 am. They were ready for 7:55 though, and the bag searchers seemed to be waiting for the green light to open the gates from higher up.

Notes: the weekend attendance for three days is normally about 350000 people, and the Sunday attendance is normally above 150000 if I remember correctly.

Some people show with the first metro at around 5:35 and camp in line, so you definitely want to be there super early.

Our experience:
We have got a team of 4 people, two running ahead with 4 lawn chairs and two not running carrying backpacks with supplies for the day. When we ran, we maybe managed to pass about 400 people. We hugged the left right after the ticket scan and then left again after getting onto the circuit to go to the hairpin. We found a spot between grandstand 46 and lance stroll in the shade for about 50% of the day.
We were in the third row of chairs (behind two rows of lawn chairs up against the fence). We had a good view of the exit of the hairpin but no view of the hairpin itself and a poor view of the trackside TV as it was East-Northeast for the track from our point of view (looking straight at the track) and it was two rows of chainwire fence so it was hard to actually see the TV. Pictures attached.

Anyhow, I would recommend getting there even earlier than we did, much earlier than 7 am, but I don‚Äôt think you can get front row seats up against the fence without taking the first train at 5:30 am sharp and running as fast as you can. I would recommend to repeat the same as what we did just show up earlier. If you‚Äôre really near the front of the line and a fast runner, I would have probably picked the spot between the Lance Stroll grandstand and grandstand 15, but there‚Äôs really limited spots there.

Our experience was good, but overall I would suggest you pay more to get grandstand tickets in the hairpin. The issue we faced though was that they were fully sold out except for 1 grandstand and we bought them day 1, so we settled for general admission. I assume this is because they offer last year‚Äôs ticket holders to buy tickets before the official ticket sales and resellers and ticket selling companies buy tickets.

The pictures provided are basically from our POV","['This is a great post.\n\nI‚Äôm a bit sad that general admission is now so poor in terms of viewing - I am sure it was better a few years ago when I did it a couple of times.

Canada is not the first time we have seen teams exploit the engine change rules after a bad qualifying.

Qualify near the back, take eveyr new component you can, cop a ridiculous grid penalty which actually costs you next to nothing and then have an additional fresh engine for the rest of the season.

There is no fairness to this and completely goes against the spirit of the rules which was cost savings, usually it is smaller teams that have less budget that are exploiting these rules.

**What I Propose:**

* Grid Penalties carry forwards, so if you take a 50 place grid penalty but qualified 19th, then next race you still carry a 49 place grid penalty
* To stop these being overly punitive (some teams could take all season to serve a 50 place grid penalty) I suggest a maximum of 3 races to carry a penalty, so the penalty is 50 grid places or 3 races, whichever is over first
* This way even if teams qualify right at the back they ahve to think carefully if taking additional engine components is actually required or just something they would like to do

I see teams taking 'free' engine changes as effectively 'cheating' and gaining an advantage for multiple races, so why not penalise them for multiple races?","['>Grid Penalties carry forwards, so if you take a 50 place grid penalty but qualified 19th, then next race you still carry a 49 place grid penalty\n\nThis was the pre-2015 system and got canned as ridiculous and confusing.\n\n\n\n>‚Ä¶and then have an additional fresh engine for the rest of the season\n\nNope. You can only run the new components going forward (they closed the stockpile loophole in 2017), so there are no ""additional"" engines. This means changing components early, or out of sequence will inevitably mean running components later and longer as the season progresses, so there is little cumulative advantage to be had.', ""Oh yeah, the joy of a major technical failure giving you racing penalties for multiple races. Fans and drivers alike will love it! Is it even worth pointing out this will disproportionately punish the slower teams? Why not just let the rules as they are act as an equaliser?

1lbyxoq,George Russel‚Äôs late contract extension is probably the result of the Hamilton/Rosberg Silver War of the mid-2010s,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lbyxoq/george_russels_late_contract_extension_is/,2025-06-15, Discussion,"I'm tired of people saying Toto is holding out to get Max, who would be terrible for Mercedes and their long term plans. Yes, Max is the best driver on the grid right now, but there's more to winning either championship than having the best driver. Alex Albon has a great interview about how Max always (apparently unintentionally) ends up making the car worse for the team with his own unique preferences. Putting their investment in Kimi at risk in that way would not be good for his development as a future star.

Toto himself has said that George is one of the top 3 drivers, which may mean he's top 2. Even if he is #3 in Toto's eyes, would it be worth trading a driver in his prime in terms of reaction time and experience for an uncertain #2 who you have never personally worked with? (Maybe Leclerc) Why introduce new variables when your team is already in a rebuilding phase on more than one front? From all accounts, George is an excellent strategist and leader, and he and Bottas are doing a good job of encouraging Kimi and getting him up to speed (no pun intended). George is nowhere near the point of his life where he needs to hand the reigns over, and since his days at Williams has been known to get the most out of a car.

I think the delayed contract is likely due to Toto trying to motivate George by creating a false sense of competition. Mercedes drivers Hamilton and Rosberg were absolutely pushing the limits of their talent when they were motivated by competition against one another, with Rosberg going all in mentally and personal-life-wise to get his title. Toto can't really create that tension right now while having George be a mentor to the next star. He can artificially create tension though by having George think he needs to fight for his seat or have Leclerc or Verstapoeb take over. Toto already has both George and Kimi follow Rosberg's eating habits during 2016, so I don't think this is too conspiratorial. It's either this mind game or money or easing pressure off himself from shareholders who think Verstappen is the best thing for Mercedes when he really, really isn't, at least not long term. 

And why would Toto risk losing organisational authority to Verstappen Senior and Verstappen Junior? That's not Toto's style at all.

They wouldnt be able to manipulate as much Merc is run much more like a machine."", '‚ÄúA driver in his prime in terms of reaction time‚Äù\n\n??? What?', 'I think the answer is really simple.\n\nGeorge and Mercedes have likely agreed to get negotiations underway either around the midseason break or the one before the final stretch of the season. As a driver jetting around the world to race, you probably don\'t want to be distracted by negotiations when you need to focus on beating McLaren, Red Bull and Ferrari. Let alone in your first season as undisputed #1 driver. Plus, you can probably ask for a better deal once you perform -- note how George keeps mentioning his performance being his main currency and all that. Lewis, a multiple WDC was signed really late during his contract extension as well, so I think this is just the norm for how Mercedes operate (that goes unnoticed because well, their previous #1 lasted 12 years with them).\n\nThe reason there is furore is because of three things. One, people *really* want the drama of Max leaving Red Bull. Two, people want more Max/George drama because there\'s almost no vitriol on the grid. Three, Toto (unsurprisingly) is an admirer of Max, which is like saying ""humans are the biggest fans of oxygen"". Throw in F1 sports journalism that\'s often starved of content (due to how F1 is often secretive and just not full of news to cover, unlike say football or basketball), and you can see how the journalists and fans themselves create this narrative that ""Max is going to replace George at Mercedes"". It\'s a tantalizing story, even if it\'s not really sensible -- Max leaving ahead of the new regs is a gamble he\'s unlikely to take. \n\nTL;DR -- It\'s probably an agreement by both parties to leave it for later, and several plausible-but-unlikely points are being strung up to create a narrative because a lot of F1 fans care about drama over actual racing.', 'Discontinue the lithium', ""Yeah saying that 'Max will be bad at Mercedes' is for sure a clear sign to a bad take.\n\nI get that letting Russell leave after a solid season looks bad but sorry Max is not gonna flop at Mercedes if he goes there, cause a few controversies with his aggressive driving? Sure, but there is no way any team will say no to Max if he leaves RB after this season (which I think is likely with all the Drama overthere). Especially Toto with how much he has been linked with the Dutchman.\n\nHe would fire Russell in a heartbeat if he could get Max.\n\nAlso I guessing Toto do not want another Rosberg/Hamilton Rivalry that causes a lot of tension in the team (just look how many times the two collided with each other). Toto would rather drive the car himself for a season than go insane having to deal with a Rosberg/Hamilton Rivalry: 2.0. Good for drama, not so much for results, especially going into 2026 where there are a whole new regulations and you want as less friction as possible.\n\nAnd saying max makes the car worse is such a bad take: Without Max Red Bull would be a midfield team at best with how the others performed and Max had to carry them."", ""Toto never signed Hamilton until the last minute when he was clearly the best driver still after each contract ended. \n\nHe's always done this.""]",0,44,0.18,0,309,309,0,0,0.03,0
