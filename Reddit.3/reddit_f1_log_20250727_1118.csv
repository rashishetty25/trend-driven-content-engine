1ma0s2k,How much risk is involved with upgrading anything now compared to just focusing on next season?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ma0s2k/how_much_risk_is_involved_with_upgrading_anything/,2025-07-26, Technical,"I genuinely thought that after a few races in we would not be seeing any more upgrades at all and only tweaks to previous components as well as the upgrades from the first few races. The only explanation I can think of related to the longevity of a teams perfomance is that these are upgrades that  let teams collect info for next year's car already and therefore act as testing for development, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to know if any components from this year's car can be reused/repurposed for next year to such a degree that it's worth it. It feels like it should be new concepts and cars like with the last regs but I'm not sure. 

It seems crazy to me to invest into this year's car unless you're red bull trying to get verstappen a title(since the constructors is decided anyway), and we have teams still slapping on new parts and spending budget on parts that won't even get to see a whole season instead of preparing for a whole new set of regulations. 

Is the squeeze of one extra constructors worth it perhaps? Since it's a few millions difference between constructors points maybe it's just worth it to spend a million or two in trying to secure another placement no matter what (or many if you're sauber squeezing out a few extra positions)? Is it to appease drivers or sponsors to not make them feel 'abandoned' for the season? 

It just feels like every dollar spent on the new reg is exponentially more valuable than the current one to me, and I'd love to see some discussion on what could make this strategy actually seem reasonable and effective rather than desperate which is how I feel about most of these upgrades right now.

Williams could just as easily finish P9 as P6 given how close everything is.  A million dollar investment in parts upgrades this season could pay out multiple times over if you can boost your WCC standings."", ""At this point I think a lot of the upgrades still coming are things they knew they needed from the start (wings made for certain types of tracks that aren't as represented in the early season as an example like most teams will have a monza wing) or things that carry over to next time that you are testing (ferrari's suspension upgrade). I don't think there are a lot of upgrades if any made purely to optimize performance this year that don't also fit one of the two categories I mentioned."", ""How do you know that every dollar spent on next year's regs will pay off?\n\n\nEvery team wants to do as well as they can every year.

Piastri has been running some older spec parts than Norris because he, and his side of the garage prefer them for example.\n\nDrivers will however often differ on their setup according to their preferences. This can have quite a significant effect on how the car handles. Verstappen likes a relatively pointy sharp car, which a lot of drivers can't deal with.

1m9tspb,Suggestion for Changes to the Points System,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m9tspb/suggestion_for_changes_to_the_points_system/,2025-07-26, Discussion,"Hey everyone,

I'm a long time F1 fan, have been watching the sport as my main interest since the 1996 season. Before this, I watched the odd race when my dad had it on, but I was just too young to appreciate it.

We've gone through a number of format revisions and points systems in my time watching the sport and, whilst I thought the 10-6-4-3-2-1 system that ran from 1991 to 2002 worked well in making points feel like a big deal, being so few points paying positions, it also meant that most drivers were racing for no reward most weekends.

  
The 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 system that came in at the start of 2003 was an attempt to stop one dominant driver running away with the championship and winning it extra early, which is what happened the previous season when Michael Schumacher picked up his fifth world title with still a third of the season left to go. It also added two more points paying positions at the same not increasing the points for winning the race. Personally I did not like this system, for me winning a race should have more weight in terms of the championship. The difference between 1st and 2nd in this system in my opinion was too small, a 2nd and a 6th should not be worth more than a 1st, although it did achieve it's primary purpose of keeping championships close.

The biggest change to points scoring since, at least the 1991 season in which finally all race results counted towards the championship, came in 2010, to what we have now. This took in to consideration modern day F1 reliability and a larger grid (3 new teams came for the 2010 season), whilst increasing the gap between 1st and 2nd place again. Whilst I like that there are more points paying positions than any other system we have ever had, I still don't think this is enough. Consider that we have a clear top 4 teams at the moment that monopolise the top 8 points in a clean race, all that needs to happen is Aston Martin to step back up to  make it a big 5 and the other teams won't have a look in. Therefore, I believe that the points system should be changed again and **all** drivers that finish a race within 2 laps of the winner should be rewarded with points, except last position.

The suggested points payout runs from the winner with the top 3 at 75-50-40, all the way down to 1 point for 21st place. This means the points tables will be a lot higher than what we have now, but they increased massively with the change in 2010 and other increase doesn't really change things in this regard. This system means that every driver has something to fight for, as long as the car/driver package is fast enough to stay close to the front-running pace. This prevents the situation we saw in 2010 when the three new teams were so ridiculously slow getting rewarded with points, it also prevents drivers/cars that DNF getting points, ever moreso putting extra importance on consistency. This means that, should only 15 drivers finish within 2 laps of the lead driver, points will only be paid down to 15th place. For example, in the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix won by Olivier Panis, with only 3 drivers finishing the race on the lead lap and one more a lap behind, these would be the only drivers to receive points that race.

I really do not see any negatives to the point system I suggested. As I mentioned, it will inflate the points tables, but they are already inflated anyway, but it puts extra importance on the race win with a large points difference between 1st and 2nd, with a massive points difference between 1st and, say 11th and below. This still means that, despite having points to fight for in the lower positions, compared to what the front runners are going to get it is still night and day difference. Sure, I would be open to suggestions for the actual points payouts but the biggest thing for me is that all drivers, within reason, have something to fight for whilst ensuring the importance of winning the race over 2nd place.

What do you think? Do you think the points system needs a revision, if so what do you think of my suggestion?","[""Personally, I like the Moto GP points system. First 15 get points, thus making sure each team gets points for the teams classification and it is a lower chance that a back marker team won't score in a season."", 'No, a driver finishing in like 18th place does not deserve points.\n\nAdditionally, the lower points you are introducing are way more about how many retirements there are, and not quality of performance.
