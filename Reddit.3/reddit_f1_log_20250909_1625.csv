I think the top teams besides McLaren seem to have drivers that are the clear favorite. Russel at Mercedes, Max at Red Bull, Charles in Ferrari. I think you could maybe argue Kimi next year and Hamilton might improve but that’s an interesting if.

Towards the midfield the Williams pair I think are a clear favorite. Albon and Sainz in a battle would be intense. I think it’s clear to say Albon has proved he is good enough to match and beat Carlos, now if in a title battle Albon might fall to pressure more than Carlos? I think that’s a question that still means a fight would go long between the two.

Probable Result: Lando P2, Oscar P3. Oscar does an extra lap, Lando gets a 1 lap undercut on Piastri. Oscar \~4 seconds behind Lando after the stops.

Scenario 2) Lando pits first, Oscar pits second, Oscar gets the slow stop. Was it an operator issue, or was it a gun issue. If a gun issue then stop 2 would've been slower i.e. Oscar's stop.  
Probable result: Lando P2, Oscar P4 behind Leclerc and Lando after the stops or \~8 seconds behind Lando (would've been close).

Scenario 3) Oscar pits first, Lando pits second, both pit stops go as expected.  
Probable Result: Lando P2, Oscar P3. Lando does an extra lap, Oscar gets a 1 lap undercut on Lando. Oscar \~3 seconds behind Lando after the stops.

Secnario 4) Oscar pits first, Lando pits second, Lando gets the slow stop.  
Actual result: Oscar P2, Lando P3. Team asks Oscar to let Lando by and they are free to race.  
Oscar is < 1 second behind Lando after letting him by.

In terms of fighting for P2, Oscar was still given an advantage over Lando than all other scenarios with what Mclaren did by asking them to swap.

Lando and Oscar did the right thing by the team. Which consists of hundreds of people at the fatcory not just themselves. Including the poor wheel gunner who either had bad equipment or a bad day at the office, we don't know.

Oscar ended up closer to Lando in this scenario than any other. And it is possible that Oscar would've finished behind Leclerc if the stops were the other way around.
