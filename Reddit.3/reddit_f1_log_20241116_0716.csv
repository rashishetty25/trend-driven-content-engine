1gru00i,[Tobi Gr√ºner] Formula 1 is working on a rule change for 2026 to make life harder for customer teams like RB or Haas.

We as a team have overtaken them, Ferrari have overtaken them. They‚Äôre doing their best, we‚Äôre doing our best, and the more pressure we can put them under the more of these kinds of mistakes they‚Äôll probably do.‚Äù\n\nAnd I find this kind of annoying considering Max has gone out of his way to publicly defend and praise Lando and talk about how important their friendship is to him, while Lando has repeatedly taken swipes at him in the media and said they‚Äôre not really friends. \n\n>‚ÄùIt‚Äôs my first time being in this situation, and time will tell how that changes.

I don\'t think Lando ever thought he had the WDC title within reach, the media circus just kept pressuring him to make comments on it. And Max, while he did feel the pressure (more from how shitty the car was than Lando\'s actual skill, tbf), didn\'t seem to let the media-inflated ""title fight"" affect him and had even given tips to Lando in the cooldown room. And no matter how hard the media tried to bait him, he never let it slip that it would change his friendship with Norris in anyway.\n\nThings might be different if it was an actual title fight though.']",51,28,0.94,51,23,23,51,28,0.94,51
