1k61fmk,[AMuS] Mercedes made a mistake with the setup,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k61fmk/amus_mercedes_made_a_mistake_with_the_setup/,2025-04-23, News,,"['Translation:\n\n> **The Saudi Arabian GP was, from Mercedes\' perspective, the worst race of the year. After the race, the engineers explained why fifth and sixth places were the best they could hope for.**\n\n> McLaren is slowly disappearing on the horizon. In the chasing pack, however, Mercedes remains the benchmark. Although the Silver Arrows had their weakest weekend of the year so far in Jeddah, George Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli scored the same number of points as Red Bull and only three points less than Ferrari. Russell summarizes: ""If we still finish fifth on a bad day, I can accept that.""\n\n> On Saturday, everything still looked good. George Russell missed pole position by just 0.113 seconds. Andrea Kimi Antonelli placed the Mercedes in fifth place on one of the most difficult tracks. This seemed to indicate that the Silver Arrows were also on top of the game on the high-speed track.\n\n> But the tide turned in the race. In the very discipline in which Mercedes had been so consistent up to that point, Russell had finished on the podium in three of the four races. This time, he began to lose sight of the champagne positions after just 15 laps, even though he was still running in third place.\n\n> **Early pit stop takes its toll.**\nBut suddenly, the gap between Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri widened, and Charles Leclerc slowly made up ground behind him. The pit lane called Russell into the pits on lap 20 because the medium tires were showing clear signs of wear and there were fears that Ferrari might attempt an undercut with Leclerc.\n\n> Leclerc actually drove an extra nine laps, gaining more and more speed on the worn-out medium tires. It dawned on Mercedes that a podium finish might be difficult this time. Even though Leclerc was still 3.6 seconds behind Russell after his pit stop.\n\n> In the second stint, Russell quickly ran into tire problems as well. They overheated: ""I tried to keep up with Max, but it didn\'t work. After that, I wanted to save the tires, but they were much older than Charles and Lando\'s. When they passed me, my tires completely collapsed. I was losing a second per lap to them.""\n\n> **Weak point front tire.**\nThe engineers could see from the data why their chief pilot had his back against the wall. The front tires on the Mercedes were blistering, a sign of overheating. It was unusual, however, that the Mercedes was the one to take the lead. The engineers explained: ""Jeddah is a track where you can choose whether the front or rear tire is subjected to more stress. We chose the front tire and probably overshot the target. We were also surprised by how fast the race pace was.""\n\n> Russell doesn\'t believe the result would have changed if he had approached the stints more cautiously: ""If I had taken more care of the tires, I probably would have still finished fifth. Ferrari was simply faster. We had a greater temperature increase than the other teams. In Bahrain, the tires also got hot, but very differently than here. We need to understand that better.""\n\n> Andrea Kimi Antonelli only felt rapid degradation of the front tires in the first stint. In the second stint, he was spared his teammate\'s extreme tire problem, although he had to deal with Isack Hadjar for six laps immediately after the pit stop. After that, the Mercedes rookie was able to give his tires a rest. The next car in front of him was twelve seconds behind. In the end, Antonelli had enough reserves to keep the closing Hamilton at bay.\n\n> **No chance of a podium finish.**\nMercedes sent both drivers into the race with a medium-hard tire sequence. Lando Norris\'s hard-medium tactic wasn\'t a viable alternative for the strategists. ""If we give Kimi the hard tires at the start, there\'s a risk of Hamilton undercutting. He would then have had to overtake Lewis at the back of the track. We didn\'t want to risk that.""\n\n> Team principal Toto Wolff summed up with a slight frustration: ""We entered the race hoping to fight for a podium finish, but with the limitations of the tires, fifth and sixth places were the maximum for us."" Chief engineer Andrew Shovlin demanded: ""We need to improve our tire management.""', 'knew something had to be wrong when russell was not third.', 'Yeah it was clear they had messed something up there. I’d also argue though that Leclerc was simply faster. Ferrari found something in race pace, whether it was aided by track temps or characteristics or they managed to unlock something on the car, that put them a step ahead in the race. With all the dirty air etc taken into account, Norris was the fastest driver during the race and Leclerc was only fractionally behind him on pace. Ferrari definitely had a step forward last weekend.', 'Well, they still have a problem with hot tracks but it isn’t like last year fortunately. Also, if Jeddah problem was because the setup it isn’t a huge or a big one imho', "">If I had taken more care of the tyres, I probably would have still finished fifth. Ferrari was simply faster\n\nIt tracks. The drop-off in their pace was significant, and Ferrari genuinely look like they had a leg up in the game. I don't deny that the SF-25's weaknesses are prominent, but in this race alone, they had the upper hand\n\nA little bit of a hot take on my end, but aside from McLaren, I still cannot put a definitive finger on the 2nd or the 3rd fastest car among the grid, between Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes. To say that Ferrari is the slowest amongst the pack will be understandable, but difficult to affirm in sheer confidence. They clearly have strong aspects to capitalize on advantages that perhaps certain teams couldn't, similarly to Red Bull.\n\nAll it takes is for a DNF or two on McLaren's end, or any of their drivers dropping into the no-points zone for Mercedes to pounce on them. It is genuinely nowhere near over just yet. It sounds like copium on my end but if teams and drivers are still in the midst of pulling off great highs, then it is all game so far"", 'So is it a damping problem or general spring softness? Or is it an aero thing? They obviously never say, but I never know how to be fast and save tires in Forza while setting up my own car.', 'I’m no rocket biologist or anything but it feels like it was pretty clear', ""People are so quick nowadays to overreact. In the first four races (including Bahrain) the tire management was perfectly fine and much better than last season, but now after one bad race they all know that Mercedes will be struggeling on every circuit going forward. \n\nThe other way around with Ferrari. After the first four races people were dismissing them entirely, but after one good race, they are suddenly seen as force to reckon with. If anything, we have seen the Top 4 will mix through depending on the track likely till the end of season. Anybody making predictions at this point can't be taken seriously."", 'Imo  , Mercedes is the most balanced car at the moment , even more balanced than Mclaren .

Top takeaways:

1. While on average, everyone is finishing lower than their quali (DNS, Ret etc. skewing the results), those starting P12 are frequently finishing P11 (probably due to the P11 ret curse). 
2. Exactly 50% of races were won from P1, really showing that clean air advantage. 
3. With the exception of Max's killer 2024 Sao Paulo Grand Prix (P17 to P1) all wins were from individuals starting P1-P5. Shout out also to Charles on his P19 to P3 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. 
4. Also of note, no one in 2024 started AND finished P17, 19 or 20.

[FIA Deputy President Robert Reids Resignation Statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jvtyw4/robertreidwrc_fia_deputy_president_robert_reids/)

In [today's post on his Substack](https://robertreidwrc.substack.com/p/time-on-my-hands) he makes some comments that jumped out to me:

>(...)

>In motorsport, we could do more here. We have legends, incredible figures whose stories shaped the sport. But too often, we focus only on the now. We race forward, literally and figuratively, without stopping to look back.

>Imagine a formal way to recognise past champions at key events. A way to connect generations. A way to remind everyone, drivers, fans, organisers, that what we do stands on the shoulders of those who came before. That history isn’t a weight, it’s a foundation.

>(...)

>Motorsport has always faced the challenge of governance, across series, regions, and levels. That’s a conversation for another time (and one I plan to return to). But it’s worth noting that strong leadership doesn’t have to mean rigidity. It means purpose. And when that purpose is clear, whether you’re running a golf club or a world championship, the sport benefits.

>(...)

>Motorsport can feel global but disconnected. Fans don’t always feel close to the sport, even when they’re passionate about it. The sense of intimacy is sometimes lost in the noise of the big show. If we could make events feel more felt, more human, I think we’d find new ways to build loyalty, storytelling, and belonging. That’s not about making everything smaller. It’s about making everything matter more.

>Stepping back from day-to-day responsibility has allowed me to reflect more freely on the sport I’ve loved for a lifetime. Watching the Masters this year reminded me of what great sport can feel like when it’s confident in itself, quiet, precise, meaningful.

>Motorsport has so much going for it. Incredible talent. Iconic events. A truly global reach. But sometimes, to move forward, it helps to look sideways. To see how other sports create meaning and how we might do the same.

>

It's too soon to assume he will be a FIA presidential contender in December, but when reading all this, I still hold out some hope.

The new US racing team will replace Ferrari\'s customer engines with its own powertrain starting in 2029. We reveal how far the project has progressed.**\n\n> Things are moving fast at General Motors. On March 7, the new US racing team, operating under the Cadillac flag, received FIA approval to compete as the eleventh team in the Formula 1 World Championship starting in 2026. Exactly 47 days later, the International Automobile Federation gave the project a second green light. General Motors Performance Power Units will be allowed to compete with its own engine starting in 2029.\n\n> This gives the American dream a face. For the first three years, Cadillac will still be using Ferrari customer engines. Then, the heart of a US engine will beat in the two factory cars. It\'s an ambitious project that will be built in a newly built factory in Charlotte over the next three years. The factory is scheduled for completion this year and will be equipped with ten state-of-the-art test benches from the Austrian specialist AVL.\n\n> FIA President Mohammed bin Sulayem takes pride in the success story: ""Over two years ago, the FIA \u200b\u200bapproved the addition of an eleventh team to the Formula 1 World Championship, guided by my vision to expand the field with new talent. While the process has been challenging at times, the progress we have made demonstrates that it has been worth the journey. It is another step in the sport\'s global expansion and underscores the growing interest from world-class automakers like General Motors.""\n\n> **Greatest possible challenge.**\nGeneral Motors has set itself the most difficult task imaginable for its entry into the engine market. Instead of waiting for the next regulatory cycle starting in 2031, the Americans are investing heavily in an engine concept that may only last for two years. The technical challenge of the drive system has never been greater than with the regulations that will take effect in 2026 and remain in effect until 2030.\n\n> Manufacturers are faced with a V6 turbo that must run on climate-neutral fuel and a significantly higher proportion of electrification. Whether the planned 55:45 power split between combustion engine and electric power will be maintained will be discussed at a meeting of the Formula 1 Commission on Thursday (April 24).\n\n> The mere fact that Ferrari and RB Powertrains, two of the five engine manufacturers currently in the field, are pushing to reduce the electric component, at least in racing, demonstrates how difficult the task is. With General Motors\' approval, the rebel club gains another member. Anything that reduces the complexity of the drivetrain helps a newcomer.\n\n> **First engine to run in summer.**\nThe team led by engine boss Russ O\'Blenes has ambitious plans. They must first focus on designing a powertrain that meets the current rulebook. They can\'t rely on backroom politics for success. Just as the attempt to switch to a ten-cylinder naturally aspirated engine by 2029 at the latest has already failed. Mercedes, Audi, and Honda reject this.\n\n> General Motors had already been preparing to build its own engine before final approval. Single-cylinder tests have been underway for some time. The first prototype of a six-cylinder turbocharged engine is scheduled for completion this summer. The project is now subject to the budget cap for engine manufacturers.\n\n> Each newcomer is granted three years of development time. GM is subject to the same limits as Audi between 2023 and 2025. In the first two years, GM is allowed to invest $105 million each in the development of the powertrain. In 2028, this will be reduced to $100 million, but in total, $25 million more than the established manufacturers such as Mercedes, Ferrari, and Honda were granted.
