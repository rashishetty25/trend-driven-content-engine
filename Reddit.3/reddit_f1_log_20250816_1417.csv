1mrbvtp,Ry≈ç Hirakawa's Lap Of Fuji Speedway,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mrbvtp/ry≈ç_hirakawas_lap_of_fuji_speedway/,2025-08-15, Video,,"[""Was lucky enough to visit this track on my last Japan trip. Super formula was racing here and the schedules lined up perfectly to make a day trip out of it from Tokyo. What an incredible experience, from arriving at the track with Fuji looming over the whole place, to the random ramen contest they had on race day where famous ramen shops set up stalls, the $2 cold beer, the go kart track that is a mini version of Fuji that we got to zip around on for $20 bucks. Besides that the actual racing and seeing/hearing Super Formula cars flying down the home straight was an experience I'll never forget. All for like $60 CAD."", ""Fuji should be brought back as the Pacific GP. It's a crying shame that a country that loves F1 as much as Japan doesn't have two races on the calendar."", 'It is a much better circuit than I remember it being. But that recollection may have been tarnished by the reception to the revised layout. A lot of people bemoaned the loss of the long final corner and its replacement with the switchback, but that just would have been completely counter-productive to modern Formula 1 cars. There was no real understanding that Fuji was not redesigned purely for Formula 1 cars, either -- other series race there, too.\n\nI remember the redesign being compared to Hockenheim: a classic circuit being butchered by an ape with no understanding of what the fans wanted. It might be an unpopular opinion, but I think the original Hockenheim was overrated. It was great in the 1980s when engines were varied, but the modern regulations meant that it soon became pretty dull. The redesign kept the spirit of the original while improving overtaking opportunities and I do not think it deserves the criticism it gets. The same applies to Fuji. I know the switchback maybe is not terribly interesting, but I can see what Tilke was going for -- it is easy to get off-line when attacking or defending, and since that leads into a gargantuan straight, any mistake is really going to be felt going down to the first corner. I cannot fault him for trying to improve the racing when the original design did nothing for it.', 'I still say Fuji is a WAY better track than Suzuka. Maybe less fun to drive but man it would put on such a better show with all the corners that invite you up the inside.', 'I didnt know i needed this today.
