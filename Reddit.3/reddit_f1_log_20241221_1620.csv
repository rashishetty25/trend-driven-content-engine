I'm doing this by assigning scores to things such as number of overtakes, number of safety cars, number of DNFs etc. and ranking them based on these scores. 

So my question to the F1 community is: What do you feel makes for an exciting, interesting race?

I.e if different people win, it\'s automatically more interesting.\n\nAlso an easy one to statistically generate I\'d assume, is one I\'d recommend adding: total time the difference on track between 1st and 2nd is under 2s.\n\nId also add something like ""is 1st currently not the fastest on track"", as that ""hunt"" from someone behind is often exciting.\n\nAlso, I did a project very similar to this (just a different sport and obiective) back when I was at uni, so if you want any help feel free to DM me.

1hirou1,Rwanda‚Äôs F1 Bid: Should the plans go ahead?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hirou1/rwandas_f1_bid_should_the_plans_go_ahead/,2024-12-20, Discussion,"On paper, the Rwandan proposals sound fantastic: a state-of-the-art circuit in a stunning location, with a fast, flowing nature. It would be a refreshing contrast to some of the lifeless, run-off-laden tracks we see today.

But as exciting as this sounds, I can‚Äôt help but feel sceptical. Rwanda would have to build everything from scratch‚Äînot just the track but also grandstands, transport links, and all the infrastructure required to host an F1 event. This is a hugely expensive undertaking, and F1‚Äôs track record with new venues (think India and South Korea) doesn‚Äôt inspire confidence. Both countries invested heavily in new tracks, only for the races to disappear from the calendar after just a few years.

There‚Äôs also the sustainability angle. F1 has ambitious net-zero goals, but building a new circuit in Rwanda, when options like upgrading Kyalami in South Africa exist, raises questions about how serious the sport is about its environmental commitments. Wouldn‚Äôt working with an existing venue be a more responsible choice?

At the end of the day, Rwanda‚Äôs decision to pursue this project is their call. But F1 has a responsibility too. If the sport greenlights this project, it needs to ensure the plans are viable in the long term‚Äînot just a flashy but short-lived investment.

What do you think? Should F1 prioritise a return to Africa no matter what, or should it focus on sustainability and long-term viability?","["">There‚Äôs also the sustainability angle.

Wouldn‚Äôt working with an existing venue be a more responsible choice?\n\nF1 added two more tracks in America when COTA is *in use* for a decade. I don't understand why they should hesitate letting Rwanda build its own one on the basis of a defunct venue. Plus, I didn't realise construction is bad for the environment."", 'no reason the sustainability angle would apply more here than anywhere else, and just because some venues failed to be successful or long-lasting doesnt mean new ones shouldnt be built. plenty of successful venues built in the modern times as well. so your points to me are largely moot.\n\nthe real questions about it to me are the humanitarian and funding questions. i am not familiar enough with the country to know much about it, but on a glance looks like a country with great amounts of poverty among other issues. so that seems like where some potential actual moral questions lie.\n\nthen again, how much does F1 care for all that?', "">Wouldn‚Äôt working with an existing venue be a more responsible choice?\n\nThat's assuming that the existing venue is being responsible. There have been multiple attempts to get Formula 1 to return to South Africa over the years, and all of them have failed. There have been problems with funding, with the ownership, with local politics; at every possible roadblock, they have run into a problem that they cannot resolve.\n\n>F1‚Äôs track record with new venues (think India and South Korea) doesn‚Äôt inspire confidence. Both countries invested heavily in new tracks, only for the races to disappear from the calendar after just a few years.\n\nThat's a bit of a misrepresentation. The Korean Grand Prix fell apart because of the Global Financial Crisis. Formula 1 was trying to lure Hyundai into the sport, but the recession his Hyundai hard. The decision to build the circuit in Yeongam was based on the expectation that there would be more investment in the region -- compare the Shanghai circuit in 2004 to the circuit today and you'll get a sense of what they were aiming for -- but with the economic downturn, the investment never materialised.\n\nAs for the Indian Grand Prix, the sport got caught up in a taxation dispute between the Delhi and Uttar Pradesh governments. The circuit is technically in Uttar Pradesh, but it was sold to audiences as being in Delhi because the circuit is practically on the boundary between the two regions. The Uttar Pradesh government felt that they were on the hook for all of the expenses, but Delhi was the one getting all of the benefits. They reclassified the race as entertainment rather than sport because that would allow them to tax the teams directly, although they never actually intended to do that -- they were just trying to force the Delhi government to back down."", ""A return to Africa would be great but I just don't see Rwanda as being close to the best option.\n\nThis is a country that's 33rd in GDP in Africa. They have other things they need to spend money on rather than this."", ""No because I don't care for F1 going to Africa when it contributes nothing to F1. If they wanna throw money at it to make it happen then let them, but it doesn't deserve to get a place for any other reason."", 'Construction is definitely bad for the environment. Anything that relies on fuels and materials that hurt the environment is bad for it.', "">on a glance looks like a country with great amounts of poverty among other issues. so that seems like where some potential actual moral questions lie\n\nI always find this argument to be deeply flawed. The implication is that Rwanda should not have a Grand Prix until such time as they address the issue of poverty. How, exactly, are they supposed to do that? There is only a finite amount of money circulating in the Rwandan economy, and programs to eradicate poverty are expensive and take lots of time to begin with. There is a very good chance that if they poured every single Rwanda franc that they have into a poverty eradication program, then they'll still come up short. So this becomes less a question of the ethics of hosting a race in a developing country and more about making sure fans and competitors are comfortable with where the sport is going.\n\nConsider this: it will likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars to build the circuit. Where do you think that money is going to go? Sure, some will be spent on hiring the architects who design the layout of the circuit and the facilities, but most of the money is going to be spent on acquiring materials, renting equipment and hiring workers to actually build the venue. That's money that's being injected directly into the local economy as well as creating jobs. When the Rwandan Grand Prix takes place, people will likely be flying into the country to see it, which means that they're going to be spending money on food and accommodation and injecting more money into the economy. And when the race is broadcast to the rest of the world, the government is no doubt hoping that investors will see that this tiny African nation has a modern developing economy, is able to complete a major infrastructure project and organise a global sporting event, and that that will be enough to convince foreigners to invest in Rwanda.\n\nBut no, we're so hung up on the ethics of having a race in a developing nation that we're apparently not willing to have a race there."", ""Rwanda is most well-known for its genocide, but it's made great strides in the 30 years since then. They don't have any worse human rights issues than any other country at the moment."", "">They have other things they need to spend money on rather than this.\n\nWhere are they going to get that money from?\n\nActually, now that I think on it, here's something that they could do: they could host a major international sporting event and use that to attract foreign direct investment -- the kind of sums that they will need to address these issues -- by showing their country to be a modern economy. This will be especially helpful because, judging by a lot of the comments in various threads on a race in Rwanda, most people only really know that it's a small, somewhat impoverished country in Africa that went through a genocide thirty years ago.\n\nAnd do you know who else had this idea?\n\nThe Rwandans!"", 'What do you think the other tracks contribute to the sport that the continent of Africa would not?
