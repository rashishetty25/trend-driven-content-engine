Max is going to be Max, and the Mercedes is one good update away from neck and neck with them.', 'McLaren is looking for the trick: How does Max impede three drivers in one SQ session and not have any of them reviewed?', ""Here's a translation by DeepL\n\n\n**How does McLaren cool its tyres?**\n\nMcLaren has the fastest car so far this year. Also because the Papaya racer controls the tyre temperatures better than the competition. Red Bull is desperately trying to find out what trick is behind this.\n\nFour of this year's five Grands Prix went to a McLaren driver. The success of the Papaya racers has a name. Almost perfect tyre management. No other car in the field manages to get the tyres up to temperature quickly and then keep them in the magic window so reliably. No matter what the tarmac temperature, no matter what the track,\n\nThis quality helps the McLaren drivers on a fast qualifying lap and even more so in the race. On a lap, because the tyres deliver consistent grip from the first to the last lap. The sector times in Miami underline this. In the first sector, Max Verstappen takes a tenth of a second off the fastest McLaren. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri are ahead in the second and third.\n\nIn the race, the advantage is even more striking. Once the McLaren drivers are ahead, they are unstoppable. Oscar Piastri has always been merciful in defeating his pursuers. But only because he matched the pace of his pursuers. In Jeddah, the Australian set his personal fastest lap right at the end. To show the competition: I had them all under control.\n\n**Lots of blue, little red and orange**\n\nSince the start of the season, opponents have been puzzling over how McLaren manages to control tyre temperatures so well even under the most difficult conditions. Red Bull is making the greatest effort to unravel the mystery. Thermal imaging cameras are used to determine the temperature at the tyre cooling ducts during the pit stops.\n\nThere is a particular focus on the rear tyres because they generally overheat more quickly than the front tyres. And the thermal images, especially at the heat races in Bahrain and Jeddah, showed that there were many blue areas around the brake vents on the McLaren tyres, while all the other cars showed a lot of orange and red. Conclusion at Red Bull: ‘It's impossible that you can cool so well with air alone.’\n\n**McLaren mocks Red Bull suspicion**\n\nRecently, the old suspicion that McLaren uses water in the tyres to keep the rubber rollers cool came up again. McLaren boss Zak Brown considers the allegation to be ‘ridiculous’. He provocatively had his drinks bottle labelled ‘Tire water’ at the command post.\n\nAccording to McLaren, the amazing capabilities of the MCL39 are a combination of plenty of downforce, good vehicle balance and innovation. Whatever that means. It could be particularly clever airflow within the brake ducts, the use of materials that keep the circulating air within a certain temperature window, or some other clever trick to cool the air.\n\nOpponents regularly bombard the FIA with requests to solve the mystery by process of elimination from the response of the world governing body's technicians. Red Bull and its sister team Toro Rosso stand out in particular. Whatever it is, it appears to be legal. The actionism of the opponents has led to the FIA taking a particularly close look."", ""I think it's pretty clear they found some sort of trick, to suddenly have found their way from the middle of the grid to dominating the field in no time at all isn't just by improving the car I would assume."", ""Red Bull suspects McLaren has found a clever way to bring their tires into the ideal temperature window more quickly, especially in qualifying. Some believe McLaren might be optimizing brake duct design or using advanced thermal coatings or suspension geometry tweaks to manage tire temps more effectively.

In the end, the clock stopped at 1:26.482 minutes – no one had ever been that fast in Miami before. ""That was an intense qualifying session,"" the rookie breathed a sigh of relief after the daring ride. ""I already felt good in practice. Then on the last lap, I pulled everything together. It\'s nice to start from the front. It\'s a completely new feeling. Let\'s see how it goes.""\n\n> Had it been a normal qualifying session, Antonelli would have beaten Sebastian Vettel\'s pole record by a full two and a half years. However, because it wasn\'t the right qualifying session, the Heppenheim native retains the age record. If Antonelli\'s learning curve continues to climb steeply, it\'s only a matter of time before the teenager starts from the front of the field in a proper Grand Prix.\n\n> With his lap, Antonelli even managed to keep the two more highly rated McLarens behind. Oscar Piastri, in the faster of the Papaya racers, ended up 45 thousandths of a second short of pole. Lando Norris couldn\'t beat Antonelli\'s time either. A tenth of a second behind means third place on the grid. Alongside the vice world champion, champion Max Verstappen will start the sprint from fourth place.\n\n> **Hülkenberg narrowly misses top ten.**\nThe two Ferraris were unable to compete for the top spots in Miami. Ultimately, the Scuderia drivers had to settle for sixth and seventh place. Charles Leclerc once again won the internal battle against Lewis Hamilton. Alex Albon, Isack Hadjar, and Fernando Alonso were at the bottom of the top ten.\n\n> Nico Hülkenberg narrowly missed the top ten finale, finishing 11th. Still, in a Sauber, that must be considered a success. The road to points in the sprint is long. In Saturday\'s 100-kilometer race, points are awarded only to the eight fastest drivers.', 'I thought that said ""sensual pole by Antonelli"" for a a sec...', 'Andrea Kimi Antonelli aKa The GOAT', 'YEAHHHHH KIMI!!!!!', 'Toto made the right call this time', 'Anyone have a video of the actual lap?']",93,13,0.85,93,57,57,4,0,0.0,4

One driver is unbeatable on his day and has been in the team for years. However he is prone to making mistakes particularly at starts and when the pressure gets high. The other younger driver looks like he may have a higher ceiling.\xa0\n\nThen there is another team where one driver is getting everything out of his car. He is a multiple time world champion and overall regarded as the best driver on the grid. He is nearly always in the fight even when the car isn’t and is keeping himself in the championship race.\xa0\n\nThen there is another team based in Britain whose lead driver is British. He is performing very well and is staying in touch with the leaders. This team seems second fastest overall. His new team mate has so far got the team’s only first place in a competitive session and is performing very well but overall a step behind the lead British driver.\xa0\n\nThen we have a team with a famous name in cars who seem to have fallen off a bit from last season and can only collect the odd podium rather than the wins it got the previous year. Their new 7 time world champion signing has shown flashes of pace but is not doing as well as the younger driver who grew up in Monaco and it is that driver who is getting the best out of his car to bring it to the odd P3 or P4 finish.\xa0\n\nOvertaking is not that easy unfortunately but the races are still filled with stories and drama and we have a very tight championship race.\n\nNow obviously there are some differences but overall I think it’s an interesting comparison.\xa0', 'Congratulations Kimi 🎊   \nAnd Congratulations Max on the new arrival 👏  👶', ""Other than a few comments here is everyone just ignoring Verstappen impeding in SQ2? It was pretty blatant but it's been crickets from the stewards and teams."", 'When actually was the last time that someone got a penalty for impeding?\n\nIf it’s not penalised it is allowed and if it is allowed then impeding others becomes a tactical play.', 'Feel like if it was anyone else but Max they would have got a penalty yesterday.\n\nHe really seems to get treated differently from other imho.', 'Did nothing come out of Max impeding in qualifying yesterday? First on Lando in the first sector and then being really slow on the racing line into the final corner for Stroll? Did nobody bother to report it or are the stewards ignoring it?', 'This thread can really be useful and in a few hours time I am expecting it to get flooded with comments', 'How in the world did Antonelli put half a second on Russell? Surely Russell made a mistake?', 'I thought he might get a penalty but he didn’t.

1kdq4f4,[AMuS] The child prodigy creates the miracle,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kdq4f4/amus_the_child_prodigy_creates_the_miracle/,2025-05-03, News,,"['I wonder how quali and Sunday will go. They looked pretty low to the ground.', ""Although it's just a sprint pole, Mercedes look proper fast this weekend so he could very well get pole too"", ""Ok it's a sprint pole guys let's not get too carried away"", 'Translation:\n\n\n> **It\'s only Andrea Kimi Antonelli\'s sixth GP weekend, and yet the prodigy placed his Mercedes on the ""small"" pole position. Despite not knowing the track, he had the confidence to take more risks than usual.**\n\n> The second sprint qualifying session of the year ended with a massive sensation. A Mercedes is at the front. No, it\'s not George Russell. Andrea Kimi Antonelli surprised friend and foe with pole position for the sprint. The 18-year-old Italian is driving in Miami for just his sixth Grand Prix.\n\n> Antonelli only knew the 5.412-kilometer Miami Autodrome from the virtual world. ""I did 70 laps in the simulator during preparation,"" said the hairy-haired driver from Bologna, who now lives in San Marino. The start to his first Formula 1 season was promising. After five Grands Prix, Antonelli is in sixth place with 38 points. You couldn\'t expect more from a rookie.\n\n> The team had prepared its rookie well for the big adventure. ""The speed was always there, whether in karting or the junior series. We told him to take it easy this season, gain some mileage and experience. Kimi stuck to that and managed the risk well,"" praised team principal Toto Wolff in retrospect.\n\n> **Antonelli deliberately waits until the end.**\nBut with steadily improving results, his confidence grew, too. This paid off in Miami. Antonelli immediately fell in love with the track. The fact that he had never driven on it before dampened his expectations. And he now dared to take more risks.\n> In both SQ1 and SQ2, the prodigy qualified in the top five with exhilarating ease. This gave him the confidence to wait for a final attempt in the top ten. His much more experienced teammate, George Russell, insisted on going out on track right at the beginning, thus guaranteeing a clear path.\n\n> Russell underestimated that the track would accelerate again within five minutes. Mercedes also decided not to give Russell\'s Mercedes four laps of fuel, allowing them two attempts with two cool-down laps in between, like Max Verstappen. ""We thought the tires would only provide optimal grip on the first lap,"" apologized chief engineer Andrew Shovlin.\n\n> **Tire temperatures in the green zone.**\nWrong thought. Verstappen improved again on his second attempt. It wasn\'t enough for Antonelli. The Mercedes driver was two and a half tenths faster. Red Bull blamed it on the new engines that all Mercedes teams received in Miami. ""Max lost four tenths on the straights. He had an old engine,"" lamented motorsport director Helmut Marko.\n\n> Antonelli himself was surprised that he ended up at the top of the rankings. ""It felt like a good round. I could have maybe done a little better in a few areas. But I\'m happy that I was on the music in all three sectors.""\n\n> Wolff believes Antonelli can maintain the lead if he gets off to a good start. Even though Verstappen, Norris, and Piastri had better long runs in the first practice session, if Antonelli takes the lead, everyone behind him will have to swallow the turbulent air.\n\n> The tire drama from Jeddah will not be repeated. Mercedes deliberately sent Russell and Antonelli on longer runs of 16 and 13 laps in free practice to ensure tire temperatures didn\'t skyrocket again. The result was positive.', 'I really hope he does well, the italian anthem is too beautiful to not be a regular haha', 'Mercedes looked on one in that session, what a lap from Kimi. Max 4th on used aint half bad either. What a sprint this could be.', 'To stirr shit again: this could well be the beginning of the end of Russells Merc carreer.', 'Just like how Ferrari got pole in Ch.. oh wait.', 'Also Russell’s SQ3 was fucked by the team’s strategy, sent him out way too soon without enough fuel for another cooldown lap + hotlap combo.']",0,13,0.4,0,11,11,0,13,0.4,0
