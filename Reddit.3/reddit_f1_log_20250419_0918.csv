""What does seem proven is that Milton-Keynes is encountering enormous integration problems between the combustion engine and the electrical system. They can't quite get the hang of making them work together. The two elements work fine separately, but they're struggling to get them to share their energy in unison.""

""Given this situation, in coffee shop chats and hallway discussions, what's being discussed internally is that someone has floated a possibility: continue using the Honda engine next year. In doing so, use Racing Bulls as a guinea pig, with whatever Red Bull Powertrains is capable of creating, regardless of its current state.""

And the million-dollar question arises: can this be possible? The answer is yes, it can. Apparently, Ford has a contract with Red Bull Austria to govern the designs of its two teams. When considering this possibility, everything suggests that the contract states that they must use their engines, or propellants associated with their name, but it doesn't stipulate which specific team or how many they must use . This detail is discussed within the blue team, and it's something that, without being able to see the contract, is impossible to verify.

Will it be this week? I don't know. Too much depends on how other people do. I don't think people should overreact to practice times though."", 'Translation and full article:\n\n> **McLaren is the team to beat, even on the second-fastest track on the calendar. Red Bull is back within one lap, Ferrari is better than its lap times suggest, and Mercedes is still searching for its form. The practice analysis.**\n\n> McLaren is playing with the competition in Jeddah. The lead of the day\'s fastest driver, Lando Norris, over Max Verstappen isn\'t huge at 0.280 seconds, but you always get the impression that the McLaren drivers still have something up their sleeve. Both drivers eased off the throttle shortly before the finish line. And neither had optimal laps.\n\n> But who had that in the evening hours of the first day of practice? The Ferrari drivers had to repeatedly abort their attempts. They\'re better than fourth and 13th place for Leclerc and Hamilton, respectively. George Russell in the Mercedes also didn\'t navigate the traffic optimally. Andrea Kimi Antonelli was slowed by a wall kiss. Pierre Gasly surprised everyone with a fastest time in the first practice session and lacked some grip in the second. In the long runs, however, the Alpine was the second strongest driver in the field.\n\n> Traffic on the Jeddah Corniche Circuit is just as big a problem as it is in Monte Carlo. The difference is that the cars are traveling much faster. Time and again, there were hair-raising evasive maneuvers. The section between Turns 4 and 8 is particularly dangerous. All blind corners, with hardly any room to maneuver. Q1, with 20 cars on the track, will be a challenge for everyone. Even one of the big drivers could get caught out, especially since warming up the tires is causing major problems for everyone.\n\n> Yuki Tsunoda\'s accident ended the long runs eight minutes before the checkered flag, leaving only short runs. Max Verstappen completed the longest distance with seven consecutive laps.\n\n> This was frustrating for the teams. The endurance runs in the afternoon heat were irrelevant, and the evening race simulations were too short to draw any definitive conclusions about tire durability. Since Pirelli supplied a level of softer tires this year, the teams are missing important information for their race strategy. McLaren boss Zak Brown, however, could still envision a one-stop race with medium tires at the start and hard tires at the finish.\n\n> **Who beats McLaren?**\nThe answer must be: none. Neither McLaren driver had optimal laps and were still in the lead. Lando Norris had to overtake two drivers in Turn 13 and managed to gain a tenth on his second attempt. By then, his tires had already lost grip. Oscar Piastri clipped the wall.\n\n> The two-time season winner demonstrated with his four-lap long run that McLaren will be in a class of its own in the race, even more so than in qualifying. His average time of 1:33.949 minutes remained unmatched.\n\n> Next best was Pierre Gasly with a time of 1:34.539 minutes. Even though Gasly only finished eighth in the second practice session, the Alpine driver could give McLaren\'s rivals Red Bull, Ferrari, and Mercedes a run for their money. And not just because of his strong long run. In the first practice session, with track temperatures reaching 50 degrees Celsius, Gasly set the fastest time. ""We were lacking a bit of grip in the evening,"" explained the Frenchman.\n\n> **Is Red Bull back on track?**\nThe track suits Red Bull, even though Max Verstappen again complained of understeer in slow corners and oversteer in fast corners in the first practice session. However, on the smooth asphalt, the tires don\'t suffer as much as they did in Bahrain. In the cool evening hours, the Red Bulls were almost back to normal. Verstappen lost almost three-tenths of a second on the fastest time and was best of the rest. Only in the race simulation does the situation continue to look bleak. McLaren is an average of 1.1 seconds faster.\n\n> Sporting Director Helmut Marko reveals: ""We made significant changes to the car between practice sessions and tried out a new setup. It worked very well on a single lap, even though we still lost two to three tenths to the McLarens. We were too slow in the long runs. That\'s where our old problem caught up with us: the tires overheat. We now have to find a compromise between maintaining the speed on a single lap and better protecting the tires in the race.""\n\n> Yuki Tsunoda is getting better and better at the Red Bull, finishing sixth, only four-tenths behind his team captain. His positive impression was dampened eight minutes before the finish line. Tsunoda\'s left front wheel touched the wall on the inside of the final corner and slid into the concrete wall on the opposite side. Marko nevertheless praised his number two: ""The speed is good, and the gap to Max is absolutely pleasing.""\n\n(1/2)', 'Is the answer to a headline that ends with a question mark typically ""no""?', 'Norris did say at the start of the year that at the rate these regs have closed the pack up, the midfield will be joining the top teams by the end of this year.\xa0', 'If the favorites are Haas or Sauber.', 'Sauber upgrades are doing something. Please just get a clean quali, Nico', 'Absolutely not.\n\nIs this season already so boring that journalists try to spin a narrative out of an FP2 session? That’s really rough', ""They have a good chassis for sure, they were matching the McLarens in some corners in Bahrain.\n\nI'm more interested to see what they can do in Monaco."", 'No']",128,43,0.85,128,572,572,3,0,0.0,3

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

1k2s19y,F1 going back to V10 engines would actually make a lot of sense.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k2s19y/f1_going_back_to_v10_engines_would_actually_make/,2025-04-19, Discussion,"V10 engines make sense for a lot of reasons you’ve already heard:
- they’re cheaper, so more engine manufacturers could come in.
- they’re lighter, so the cars would be more nimble and agile (better late braking, etc).
- the sound adds much more spectacle.
- they’re far more reliable, because of no complex electronics.
- smaller = smaller, lighter cars = smaller aero = better racing.

But there’s an even more FIA-friendly reason I haven’t seen spread around much: powering them with sustainable fuels would make the cars carbon neutral. Since F1 is supposed to match/inspire the global automobile market, why not promote technology that wouldn’t require the public to sell their naturally aspirated cars in favour of electric vehicles, but instead keep their current cars and fill them with eco fuel instead? It’s a much cheaper climate change solution for the average consumer. 

V10 cars (even V8s, honestly) are the perfect solution for promoting carbon neutral technology that could drip down into the average road car, and it would make the racing so much better.","['first: car manufacturers want you to buy a new car, they have literally zero incentive to motivate you to keep your current car\n\nand second: ""ecofuels"" are just biofuels, they don\'t come from crude oil but they still create air pollution and global warming, no matter what mental gymnastics the marketing people at F1 want to claim', ""E Fuels won't come to normal consumers in the near future if ever. There's way to little production planed (all the planned plants until 2040 just even have enough capacity to fuel all Porsches in Germany), it's always going to be way more expensive than just electricity because of thermodynamics and most important it will be needed in other sectors way more (flights and ships) were finding alternatives is way harder."", '\\> they’re cheaper, so more engine manufacturers could come in.\n\nno. f1 engine are expensive no matter what configuration. The myth that says v10 f1 engines are cheap is mainly due to the plurality of engines used in the past not the total cost. Furthermore this would be only valid if all electrical parts would be canceled and that is not going to happen.\n\n\\> they’re lighter, so the cars would be more nimble and agile (better late braking, etc).\n\nNo. Only true if you get rid of all electronics which is not going to happen. if you want a lighter engine lose power or increase the compression with lots of other side effects.\n\n\\> the sound adds much more spectacle.\n\nOnly true part. But only true without any turbocharging if you are concerned about volume. The pitch is a lot nicer though.\n\n\\> they’re far more reliable, because of no complex electronics.\n\nThe old V10s lasted around a race. If they even lasted a race. At the current hp levels they would either be insanely expensive or shortlived, which makes them cheaper but you need more which is .. expensive. You cannot have both.\n\n\\> smaller = smaller, lighter cars = smaller aero = better racing.\n\nOnly if all previous statements hold, which they do not.\n\nedit: I might also add that higher cylinder count alters the length/width/height of an engine, not the volume in general. higher count v shapes are generally longer and less high but not necessarily smaller for the same power rating. The infamous 12 cylinder boxer being a prime example of this tradeoff.', 'Why would car manufacturers want to promote not buying a new car?', 'What a fantastic post. Not source, no reasoning just vibes and nostalgia glasses. You have made 5 different points: 2 of them are literally the same one and 4 of them i dont even know if they are true.\n\nPoint 2 and 5: How much weight is the battery actually adding? The 2014-2016 cars were smaller and lighter and already had the same hybrid system we have now in F1. ""lighter cars = smaller aero = better racing"" how exactly are these directly connected to the engine? are the batteries really making the cars that much bigger?\n\nPoint 3: personally i dont think it does but to each their own.\n\nPoint 4: are we really seeing that many realiability issues from electronics?\n\nPoint 1: might be cheaper but is the interest there from a lof of manufacturers to produce ICE only enignes when their strategy seems to  be focus more and more on electric cars? They can keep investing another 10 billion into the ICE to get marginal gains with no real world impact or finally focus more on EVs to avoid falling behind.\n\nedit: ""sustainable fuels"" the most sustainable fuel is electricty. All the liquid forms are simpy not sustainable even if you slap that sticker on it. You are just naive falling for their marketing', 'Hahaha you still believe MBS pr to fool people.
