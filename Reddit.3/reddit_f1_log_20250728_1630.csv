1mbaarm,Tyres continues to destroy the possibility of good races.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mbaarm/tyres_continues_to_destroy_the_possibility_of/,2025-07-28, Discussion,"I have posted previously that I find it incredibly frustrating that the (S) tyre is basically a qualifying tyre now and almost never gets any use in races.


But once again the race yesterday saw basically no variance in tyre strategy 


Most cars put the (M) tyre on around lap 13. 


By lap 20 
- Piastri 1:46:7
- max 1:46:8
- Leclerc 1:47:1 
- Russell 1:47:4


On lap 43 
- Piastri 1:45:7
- max 1:46:5
- Leclerc 1:46:5
- Russell 1:56:6


Now obviously the cars are carrying much less fuel at this stage, but how is the medium still performing this well after 30+ laps! 


There is no point in risking a tyre change when the delta doesn’t exist and overtaking is difficult 


","[""I actually thought Lando putting on the hards was a masterstroke because I didn't expect a medium to last 3 quarters of a race"", ""big factor is the low track and air temp that put way less stress on the tyres.\n\nProbably, in a 100% dry race with 25-26°C air temp and 40+°C track temp, Medium tyres wouldn't last 30+ laps."", 'Yeah, the mediums lasted longer than expected, I think the cold weather helped.', 'cold weather helped pilots keep those tyres usable last so long, only cars with excessive load were chewing through them.', 'Pirelli skipping a compound theoretically meant that the Hard should have been too slow, and so would push everyone to a 2-stop race on the significantly faster Mediums paired with either a Soft or Hard. There should have been variety in strategy. \n\nThe problem was the wet start and shortened race (not just that we went racing on Lap 4, but that the slick tyre race started on Lap 11-13).\n\nThis resulted in a 32 lap dry race, which made the two-stop too slow and so all strategy pointed to managing the Medium to the end. That’s what ruined it. \n\nIn essence a super slow paced Medium was faster than a pushed Hard which was faster than a pushed Medium-Medium.', 'The issue is more complex.\n\n\nPirelli has to provide three compounds but they need to cover a ton of scenarios based on the weather and in general during the year you have such different conditions in terms of temp, heat, surface that they just cannot have that many specific tires and they need to guarantee safety across all of these possible conditions.\xa0\n\n\nIf the tires are too different in performance then you force the same strategy ultimately.\xa0\n\n\nThe bigger issue at play here is that tires have become the only strategic tool and this makes races way more predictable. Refueling added so much dynamics to races as you could undercut heavily since less fuel also meant shorter pit stops.\n\n\nNow the difference between the slowest pit and the fastest is what, 1s? This makes it just so hard to use pits and number of stops as a viable strategy', ""Tyre management. Piastri drove exactly as fast as he needed to to stay out of range of Norris, and exactly as slow as he needed to to make the tyre last to the end. His 1:45.7s on lap 43 (so, low fuel) is a full five seconds slower than his fresh tyre SQ1 run.\n\nArguably the only one of the front runners who would going be flat out on slicks would have been Norris since he (we assume) didn't need to worry about making it to the end on his C1s.\n\nEdit: added low fuel to L43"", 'Track resurfacing also had an impact. Similar to Suzuka', ""The amount of races I've seen where the driver in second is several seconds behind but on a better tyre and just completely fails to catch up is unbelievable. It's so dull and predictable. I didn't think for a second that Lando could catch Oscar yesterday and even if he did, Oscar would have had battery to defend.""]",633,223,0.91,633,200,200,101,17,0.0,101

They’re handling inter team battle really well (but considering other teams are realistically out of the fight it’s probably easier) Both drivers are showing great level of driving with Oscar having a slight edge in consistency over Lando. But even with slight mistakes Lando makes, he’s still keeping himself in a Fight.\n\n**Max Verstappen**\n\nProbably the only bright spot of the Team this year so far. He’s always ready to pounce and grab the win when the opportunity arrives. Really can’t ask anything more from a driver and Max this season is the only thing keeping mclaren drivers on their toes.\n\n**Williams and Albon**\n\nWilliams delivered on a huge growth this year, definitely a positive step in the right direction and mostly thanks to incredible consistency from Alex. Everyone doubted him, and put him under a lot of pressure with Carlos coming into a team but he handled himself brilliantly. You could say Carlos had a few unlucky ones this year but Alex has him beat handily so far and he showa no signs of stopping.\n\n**Pierre Gasly**\n\nI think it’s unfair to see how little recognition Pierre gets this year. He’s driving the wheels of of that Alpine and i genuinely sometimes can’t believe how he pulls it off. A team that has myriad of problems with management (or should i rather say missmanagement), morale, performance, he’s still getting regular q3 entries with some outstanding Qualy laps, and some wonderful race drives. He’s definitely one of top driver performers this year.\n\n**Sauber**\n\nFrom a team that i expected the least, and when i expected them to wait out a Year before transforming into Audi. They surprised me the most. It looks like they really consolidated their management and leadership, nailed a driver pairing and even brought upgrades to the car to be genuinely competetive with other midfielders. It’s great to see them being rewarded with a podium (And what a podium it was). Both Nico and Gabi had great races.\xa0\n\n**George Russell**\n\nThis is the year where George really visibly stepped up. Lewis leaving mercedes created a big power vacuum, and George took it upon himself to take it. He’s shown some real stellar drives this year, and barely put a foot wrong so far this year. He’s finally showing his true potential that he was being called for years. Ultimately he’s being let down by Mercedes and a car they delivered him (much like Leclerc).\n\n\n**Charles Leclerc**\n\nThere’s really not much more a team can ask from their driver. Charles is doing absolute maximum Ferrari is able to do. He’s consistent, his racecraft is wonderful, tyre management is great, Charles is having a stellar driving season so far and is being let down by the car that simpy doesn’t have the pace to be competetive for the wins. He really continued on his driving form from last season in the best possible way, and it’s a real shame he cannot crown it with wins.\n\nNeutrals\n\n** Racing bulls**\n\nI was thinking, is it really fair not to put them in the positives column, they had some stellar drives, bunch of points, and Hadjar really impressed with some great drives as a Rookie. It’s true but whole driver seat drama in RB family, really leaves bad taste. They started the season strong with both Yuki and Hadjar, then when the swap happened lawson had a lot of issues, but in the end he’s also slowly regaining confidence and driving better. Strategy wise they’re still the biggest clowns of the field and that is the only reason why i’m not rating them positively.\n\n**HAAS**\n\nHaas this year might be the definition of neutral. While they had some great drives from both drivers and the pairing seems to work really well, they are really showing no signs of some great improvement and growth. They are always in the mix to score some points but also can be nowhere near them.\n\n\n**Lewis Hamilton**\n\n\nTransition to the red team has been really painful for Lewis. I cannot say he disappointed because it would be unfair, he had few stellar drives but mostly he was average at best. The car doesn’t suit him and it’s painfully obvious. Charles has and edge on him but i think that was also expected. Overall, pacewise i don’t think he’s even that far from Charles. And i genuinely think that Carlos wouldn’t be better than Lewis this year in Ferrari even though he’d have a lot more experience with red cars. Lewis has shown sparks of his true self in some races and i hope he continues to improve in the rest of the season but ultimately Ferrari gave him an ass of a car and it’s hampering him a Lot.\n\n\n*Negatives*\n\n\n**Ferrari**\n\n\nI think it’s fair to say that ferrari is abbysmal this year. From a team that was genuinely competetive to Mclaren last season to the team that is a 5th best car on some occasions this year. A shame because they have a super interesting drivers lineup and they’ve managed to fuck them up.\n\n**Red Bull**\n\nA fall from grace of last year spiraled to an abyssmal level this year, Car is barely drivable even for Max, losing a bunch of crucial staff members, comically atrocious missmanagement of the team and 2nd car being virtually non existant. \xa0The whole Yuki/Liam situation was ridiculous, pit stop crew is also out of shape for many races this year.\n\n**Aston Martin**\n\nReally don’t know what to say about them as a team. Stroll is non existant for most of the races, Alonso is driving average this season with some good results.\n\n**Alpine**\n\nTeam missmanagement (whole doohan colapinto saga), car going nowhere pacewise even with upgrades, Gasly is the only bright spot of the team.\n\n\nI understand i haven’t mentioned some stuff and drivers, but post is already too long :)', 'Is the 16 points the largest lead the whole year?', 'best rivalries \nLeclerc v russel\nalbon vs antonelli \nrest of the field vs each other - p12 - p20 brutal', 'Just one points finish in last 7 races is ridiculous. \n\nNot that he’s at fault for them all, but he’d be sacked at Red Bull or exchanged for an VCARB driver', 'Antonelli reeks of underdevelopment.

1mbcjy4,"On racing, and danger",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mbcjy4/on_racing_and_danger/,2025-07-28, Discussion,"CW: talks about death

There has been a big discussion lately on whether the 2025 Belgium Grand Prix should have started under wet conditions or not.

There is worthwhile discussion to be had around this issue, it ultimately boils down to some people will have higher risk tolerances, and some will have lower tolerances. Discourse seems unlikely to change that.

So this is not a post about whether the race should have started sooner or not.

This post is instead about addressing a sentiment that has been surprisingly common in this community.

You have surely seen comments such as these (these are all real comments from the last 24h, I don't want to strawman here): 

- Humans enjoy watching others risk their lives for their own entertainment. We used to have duels to death for millenniums. 

- I dunno, I preferred the sport when it was more about the spectacle than safety. 

- Motorsport is and always will be dangerous. It should be, that's part of the thrill. 

- As much as I don’t want anyone to get hurt (I definitely don’t) the risks and accidents make f1 exciting. 

- I want the mess and the crashes.

These comments are arguing (with, it must be said, a variable amount of hinges) that risk, danger, spectacle, are something that enhances formula 1, racing in general. 

It's a compelling sentiment, but I want to argue how it is not necessarily true, and later I'll provide an alternative viewpoint that will hopefully give you a different perspective on danger and racing.

Crashes and danger add to the thrill:
I was at Spa in 2019. The danger of racing was on full display. There was a big crash, a red flag. People left the circuit not knowing what was going on. Thrilling and exciting are NOT words I would use to describe the mood. There was horror, there was shock, there was anxiety. There were people retching on the side of the road while waiting for their shuttles. We later found out that Anthoine Hubert had died in that crash. He was 22 years old. 

About a year later Romain Grosjean went into the barriers at Bahrain. The fireball was surely spectacular. Do you remember how you felt at that moment? Would you describe the feeling as exciting? I bet you weren't thinking ""Now that's why I tune in to F1"".

""Danger makes F1 exciting"" is a compelling sentiment, but ultimately a very shielded one. A sentiment that is privileged enough to not have been face-to-face with the consequences of said danger. 

A better alternative:

So, we like the danger, but not it's consequences.
That makes F1... a rollercoaster. You go on a rollercoaster because of big thrills. You want to FEEL danger, without actually being exposed to it. No one wants their rollercoaster to actually BE dangerous - ""I heard they really skimped out on the maintenance on this one!"". 

So feel free to argue about the FIA's decision. But please remember:

We are here for the racing, not the danger. You don't actually like the danger, you like the idea of it.

That's all I have to say, please refrain from turning this thread into another discussion on what should have been done yesterday. I think I made it clear, this is meant as a criticism of the ""Danger is exciting"" sentiment.

PS. There is a bit of a tone shift when I talk about Hubert's crash. I wrote that section last, after I had already made the light jokes about rollercoasters and so on. If that comes across as disrespectful, or insensitive I can only apologise.

","['There should be jeopardy, but not danger.\n\nCrashing is part of the sport and is a neccesary part of the sport as it is what seperated the good from the great, it is what penalises mistakes in an effective way. Racing is risk and reward. Without the risk of crashing then racing becomes much easier to do and much less interesting to watch, not because we like seeing crashes, but we like to see drivers being brave and doing incredible things.\n\nHowever what the drivers should be risking is finishing the race, or losing time, not injuries and death.', 'When people say danger they generally mean ""it\'s more difficult to drive and it makes the risk of someone wiping out larger, drivers need to be more skilled and careful, which increases excitement"".\n\nNot ""I hope someone dies today"".\n\nAnd there\'s a reason so many of the best races of all time are wet races. Because it\'s the only races that aren\'t decided entirely upon who has the best car.     \nWe knew 2 races in who was going to win close to every single race this year (one of the Mclarens), wet races being the only likely exceptions.', 'yes, the ""danger is exciting"" sentiment is straight bullshit, and people who genuinely derive excitement from watching people die should get themselves checked into an institution\n\nbut I think that\'s not the main point people are making when it comes to racing in the rain, the main sentiment is ""we should be able to race in these conditions safely, and the FIA really need to sort out their shit to make it happen""\n\nthe fact that with just a bit of a drizzle visibility can get so low that you can barely see the car that\'s ahead of you is a big problem with these ground effect cars, and in 2026 the hope is that the new lower downforce floors and lack of a beam wing will reduce that spray', 'I think you’re putting words in the mouths of many who are simply suggesting (right or wrong) that the race could have run safely and the full wet tires weren’t even used when the race started.\xa0\n\nIn years past, we would see the skill of the drivers in the rain, which really allows spectators to see just how amazing they are. Granted they’re like that on every lap they do, but in the rain it’s just easier for those, especially watching a broadcast, to see their skills.\xa0\n\nIf this was a perfect storm (no pun intended) because Spa is very high speed, has had a recent death, and visibility with these cars especially is a challenge, then so be it, and perhaps it was the best call to make.\xa0\n\nBut to suggest that people asking for the race to have started earlier is because there would be a greater element of danger is disingenuous to many. Many viewers simply enjoy seeing the impressive skills in true wet conditions, and it’s got everything to do with keeping the car on the track and pointing straight, and nothing to do with the idea of danger and devastating crashes.\xa0', 'The issue isn’t safety vs spectacle, the issue is the design of the cars themselves creating far too much spray. We all want to see wet racing, but we simply can’t race in wet conditions anymore. I can count on one hand the amount of times full wets have been used by the majority of the field', ""You have to remember, this isn't just about the drivers safety, but the safety of the marshals and crowd. \n\nWhen Jules Bianchi hit a JCB after losing control in the wet. It is often forgotten that there was a team of marshals around that car and driving the JCB. They are all very lucky to be alive and could easily have been hit by Bianchi's car. \n\nSure, racing drivers accept that they are taking part in a dangerous sport and are paid millions to do so. \n\nMarshals aren't millionaires. They are mostly volunteers."", 'Thank you for adding this viewpoint. It’s important to remember that the drivers are humans. \nAnd while crashing is part of the game, so is an expectation of the driver being able to come away from the crash in a relatively and reasonably safe condition in the end. \n\nPutting humans in a condition where there is valid speculation that this level of safety not be the outcome, isn’t what anyone should want to see at the end of the day. \n\nIf the drivers are driving in a condition where there is a valid risk that they may not be showing up to the next race should they crash due to conditions outside of their control isn’t a good way to race.', '>About a year later Romain Grosjean went into the barriers at Bahrain. The fireball was surely spectacular. Do you remember how you felt at that moment? Would you describe the feeling as exciting? I bet you weren\'t thinking ""Now that\'s why I tune in to F1"".\n\nI was watching live when this happened. I think I had tears in my eyes. I kinda relived the moment when I saw the F1 Exhibition. It had one room dedicated to this crash. I basically relived the moment and all the feelings I had. It was definitely not a moment I want to see and witness in F1.\n\nAnd thank you for the post. It deserves all the upvotes and more.', 'Hubert and Grojean’s crashes both happened in the dry. Nobody is asking for gladiators, but if it’s really about safety, we’d be racing at 60kph on padded tracks. Most of the horrendous crashes of the 21st century have been in the dry conditions. It’s a dangerous sport; the drivers know it’s a dangerous sport, yet they show up anyway.

Thanks!","[""Seems I'm alone here in having actually enjoyed the race. There was some tension about the lead, and a lot of movement in the rest of the pack throughout much of the race.

Oscar knew he needed to take his chance and he did, so credit to him. Would love to better understand the battery issue Lando had and how much of a role it played (and how much of it was in/out of his control), but not sure we'll ever know. \n\nOnce Lando was in P2, the tire offset was probably his only fighting chance. A shame they didn't/couldn't double stack, since he easily lost net time to Oscar by having to do another lap on inters and lost net time to Charles behind as well, but I also have a feeling that if they had double stacked they would've both ended up on the mediums since the call for the hard seemed to be a super last minute call from his engineer as he was coming in. The extra lap on inters + the slow stop + a much slower tire meant he was climbing a mountain just to put Oscar under pressure. I think his own mistakes cost him the chance to get into DRS range, but I'm not sure even if he had had 5-6 laps of DRS behind Oscar that he would've been able to make the pass, given what we saw in the sprint and with Max/Charles throughout the whole race.\n\nOverall, I think both Lando and Oscar can take away plenty of positives from this weekend.

They said they were going to do a minimum of 2 laps behind the safety car, Ok 1 probably would have been enough but you\'ve made the decision that it will be 2 at minimum so I understand doing 2 laps, but then they did another 2 laps behind the safety car on top of that.\n\nthat I think is worthy of criticizing.\n\nthough to add some balance i think the *""end of wet races""* doomsayers may be overreacting.

Can we just get rid of the wet tyres? It's not Pirelli's fault, but by the time the track conditions are bad enough for the full wets, visibility is too poor to race.

But when you neutralize the fact that he’s in a top-2 car — which can even be the best in cold conditions — the data becomes extremely disappointing. He was completely outclassed by Russell. Finishing behind him in 100% of the races statistically means Russell is simply *much better* than him, because Antonelli couldn’t even beat him once by luck or by making fewer mistakes. Looking at it objectively, it even feels unfair to see Antonelli getting all the attention just because he has a faster car and ends up near the top, while Hadjar, Bortoleto, and Bearman seem far more interesting than him.

Edit: ""rookie vs veteran"". We never had a champion that lost all their races against their rival. Usually it's very balanced and many won as rookies.

I’ve never enjoyed Spa and have also dreaded its arrival on the calendar. The race has pretty much always been a dud (since I started watching). 2024 was fine—not the worst but not top 10 either. I have no love for Miami, but I’d rather watch 2 Miami races than what we got today. 

My question for long time watchers is when did things trend poorly for Spa? Is it reg specific? It seems unlike Japan and Imola, Spa has good passing corners and plenty of room for these bigger cars. I just don’t get it. 

On the flip side, I have a deep love for Austria. The race is pretty much a guaranteed banger. And I’m always shocked to hear how people have not universally loved this track until more recently.

1mb1wd2,2024 Sainz vs 2025 Hamilton: It's not really close,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mb1wd2/2024_sainz_vs_2025_hamilton_its_not_really_close/,2025-07-28, Discussion,"Last year Carlos Sainz ended up with 9 podiums for Ferrari. He won Australia and Mexico. And in addition to 7 other podiums for Carlos, he also had 5 5th place finishes and a 4th. 15 top 5 finishes.

Through 13 races last year Seinz had 190 points. Hamilton has 109 (no I didn't transpose the numbers).

And yet you hear very little about Sainz now, struggling along to do the best he can with Williams; he's getting beat there by his own teammate this year, so there's that. Obviously it takes a little time to acclimate to a new environment; a reason that Hamilton OBVIOUSLY is given the benefit of the doubt on, despite last year's results at Mercedes.

Today Sainz's own pit crew screwed him over. And they then decided on a 2 stopper, and it simply didn't go his way today. Hamilton had one of his better races; passing a bunch of guys with his updated equipment and getting up to where he's normally at.

I do not feel that Hamilton is ever a threat to win a race. LeClerc has been consistently outperforming the world champion. It doesn't really feel competitive. Just like last year didn't feel that competitive with George Russell at Mercedes. I feel that, of the 8 seats that make up McClaren, Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull, Hamilton is at best 6th, with the jury being out as way too early on Antonelli. Only the 2nd RB seat doesn't compare to Lewis.

In hindsight, the manner in which Sainz was quickly ushered out of Ferrari seems sort of sickening at this point. He's left to one choice, no options. And he's done career wise, unless one of the big three/four invite him to a seat, and obviously Ferrari isn't in the cards for that.

This seems alot different from a driver CHOOSING to leave because he's not the number one driver and wants to go somewhere else to be the big dog, like what happened with Daniel Riccardo, who should probably never have left RedBull. He's the last great 2nd driver they've had in years.

Guys like Sainz and Botas, who was a pretty darn productive driver for Mercedes, they both got the short end. Watching Nico's 3rd place finish a few weeks ago got me really thinking about this. There are some pretty damn good drivers out there, without the equipment to show their talent, left hoping for inclement weather or a miracle for them to have a quality day.

I've always loved Alonso, and have watched his struggle for many years now. About half the time he's ""the best of the rest"". Not this year obviously. But you watch him and you see the talent after all these years, and you cannot help but wonder how he'd do in a number one seat at one of the best places. Like with Sainz.
