1jfh220,Which is the most successful current seat in F1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jfh220/which_is_the_most_successful_current_seat_in_f1/,2025-03-20, Discussion,"Inspired by u/akastus's question about the most successful race engineer, I was wondering which F1 seat has had the most world championships won in it? That is, tracing which side of the garage a driver is on and finding out which one has the most driver's champions victories.

I know Max is in Vettel's old seat (both drove with Riccardo), so that seat has 8.

Kimi's seat has 6 for sure, but what about Button's championship, (if that counts), both drivers left Brawn when it went to Mercedes. Rosberg and Barrichello switched seats to and from Williams, so does that mean it was Button whose seat was taken up by Schumacher and later Hamilton, making it 7?

But it's got to be an old team, Ferrari or McLaren probably

Ferrari has 15 driver's titles, so at least 8 are in the same seat, McLaren has 12, so might beat Ferrari out?

Okay, so it probably can't be Ferrari *or* McLaren, neither has a clear 8 to beat Red Bull.

Oddly, the only other competitor is Mercedes, if you count Brawn and Tyrell then it should be feasible for Lewis's seat to beat RB

*Okay so by my calculations, the most successful seat I can track is Max's current seat, as 8 drivers championships have been won in it, second best is a tie between Raikkonen and Schumacher's Ferrari seat, Senna, Lauda, Hunt, and Fittipaldi's McLaren seat, and Lewis's Mercedes seat. All at six.*","[""Okay, so Raikkonen and Schumacher had the same seat, that's 6  \nScheckter is the other seat, with Lauda that's 4\n\nWhen Lauda and Regazzoni come in there is a complete driver replacement, I think Regazzoni took Ickx's seat, as Ickx leaves of his own volition mid season, and Regazzoni has to recommend Lauda.\n\nAand now it's 1971 and Ferrari has entered three cars in multiple races.\n\nThe way the cars and seats boil down, I think only Ickx can be followed further.\n\nI don't think I can follow this trail back further, from '70 to '69 all three drivers get changed out, and while I could say Ickx, who also drove in '68, is a good enough connection, the same issue occurs in '67.\n\nSo it probably can't be Ferrari, unless they're a strong case to tie the drivers together before there are only two.

1jfozun,Opinions: The poor reception to Lewis' comments is simply down to difference in terminology usage.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jfozun/opinions_the_poor_reception_to_lewis_comments_is/,2025-03-20, Discussion,"To put it short: I think this is more of a translation error, so to speak, than anything else. Lewis didn't *literally* mean that the relationship between Max and GP is abusive, ""abuse"" here in the UK, has multiple connotations and things like swearing are sometimes referred to as ""abusive language"", which is what I think Lewis was trying to say, but it doesn't actually mean that the relationship itself is abusive. It does feel like this whole little thing has itself, ironically, been overbliwn because of a simply difference in usage of words.","['Are we really debating semantics when there are countless other things we should be baselessly speculating on during race week?', ""I agree it's overblown, but I also don't understand his point anyway.
