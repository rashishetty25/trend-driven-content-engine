In every race, the big discussion is about temperatures, how much life is left in them, their pressures, and so on. Since they got rid of refueling, it’s the only tactical component left in the race.

It’s the most important factor in how the race will play out. How come F1 hasn’t made an effort to present those figures like temperatures and pressures on the feed?

I know they had a brief period with thermal cams, but as cool as they looked, they didn’t really convey anything other than that tires get hot in corners or cold during a Safety Car period.

I’m convinced that if the information were publicly available, it would a) be super cool to know more about components of the car, and b) add an intriguing instrument to race tactics.

I know teams will hate it, but F1 management has the power to spice things up and give (hardcore) fans something interesting to study during the race.

1l8nooc,"Ferrari, that's the SF-25 in Canada: important changes soon, TD cost months",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l8nooc/ferrari_thats_the_sf25_in_canada_important/,2025-06-11, News,,"['So no new rear suspension yet… if they are switching to 2026 soon I wonder why they are bothering with the suspension at all.', 'The European triple header made up of the Imola, Monaco and Barcelona GPs returned a somewhat encouraging image of the Ferrari SF-25. Charles Leclerc managed to get on the podium twice - in Monaco with a second place that almost tasted like a defeat, and a third place in Spain, partly fortunate, partly the result of good pace from the car - which were worth precious points. The SF-25, despite the debacle in qualifying at Imola, the most hostile track for the Italian car among the three of the triple-header, remains a car that in race pace shows it is capable of expressing second-force potential, especially in hot races.\n\n""On the pace we are more or less there. The characteristic of this car is that it suffers much more in qualifying than in the race."" (F.Vasseur)\n\nThe consistency in results that came from the European triple has allowed the Scuderia di Maranello to rise, almost unexpectedly, to second place in the constructors\' championship, overtaking a Mercedes that is still too erratic and with reliability problems, and a Red Bull still lacking in results from its second driver. The SF-25 remains “crippled” in performance by conservative set-ups to preserve skid wear. Pending the macro-development including the new rear suspension, the set-up compromise remains the car\'s big limitation. Info tells us that on the development front the situation is still very dynamic, but the internal operations relating to the 677 are close to being completed in order to make way in the tunnel for the 2026 car within the current month, as scheduled.\n\n**Ferrari with an evolving situation after the European triple header. In Spain no game changer but cars are more limited: the new directive cost the top teams 8 months of development.**\n\nA new front wing debuted in Spain, developed to comply with the new anti-flexion regulations imposed by the FIA. An update that had been expected and planned for months, making a virtue of necessity due to the T018 directive communicated to the teams at the end of January.\n\nNo substantial “game changer”, the wing directive has not materially altered the hierarchies, such for someone to consistently undermine a McLaren still with a technical advantage, but not super dominant. The values on the field, however, while not having seen radical changes in hierarchies, may not have been affected by the introduction of stiffer wings. Canada is already a further test.\n\nAn average loss of about a tenth is what the TD018 causes, with the Ferrari wing roughly back to pre-Austin 2024 stiffness values. An obligatory turnaround, which costs a top-team around eight months of work by the wing department, and around 50% of the budget spent on wing development. On-track feedback from the new specification in Barcelona was positive about the wing\'s new aerodynamic look. The loss of efficiency generated by the increased stiffness was partially offset by the new aerodynamics thanks to what we know to be a “more efficient” out-wash.\n\nFor the first few years of this regulation, the trend in wing shape was towards more extreme configurations, with upper flaps designed to increase the flow offset outside the front wheel envelope. With the rise of more flexing wings, the trend in aerodynamic form has shifted to having larger profiles in the mid-wing structure, taking advantage of controlled flexing to gain efficiency. It is clear that with TD some teams may have found better compromises than others. Some have managed to maintain good dynamic characteristics despite the stiffening of structures, thanks to more advanced materials.\n\n**Canadian GP: in 2024 it was a disaster with wrong pressures and colder weather. A stop & go track for an SF-25 with no updates**\n\nThe Montreal track with this generation of cars has never given Ferrari victories. In the first year Sainz was in a battle with Verstappen while Leclerc had no great luck. The technical and climatic characteristics are very different to the last three European races, and we return to a semi-city circuit with long straights, heavy braking and slow restarts: a classic “stop and go” track, where traction and braking are fundamental. A track that Hamilton has always liked, but with the Englishman still having to have full control of his car.\n\nTemperatures are lower than in scorching Barcelona, where switching on and windowing the tyres on the single lap remains the key issue in the simulator. Ferrari will return to using the “V-shape” rear wing configuration, with evaluation on the slightly trimmed flap configuration that ran in both Arabia and Italy. No significant updates are expected on the SF-25, which will not be reserving any new components for the overseas leg. Serra has been overseeing operations throughout the European triple, and the work in Maranello for Canada has been aimed at fine tuning the current package, making gold from the mistakes of 2024, when the Canadian GP represented one of the low points of the previous season, a gift to the competition that probably cost the world championship.\n\nTranslated by DeepL', '“the new directive cost the top teams 8 months of development.”\n\nPeople were saying Ferrari would be a big benefactor…\xa0\n\nNext Year ™️\xa0', 'Because they were planning to use this new geometry for the 2026 car.

Leclerc drove a fantastic race and wasn't that much slower than the McLaren's.\n\nHoping Ferrari can bring the upgraded suspension for Silverstone as the track layout is similar."", 'max was quick, but its a high speed track just like jedah and suzuka. if anything redbull should have had the advantage here', ""I think it's a fair point, I wouldn't say it's yet to come, but at the very least that Spain isn't indicative of the rest of the season, we've seen Mclaren cruise to wins in trivial manners, but we've also seen Max win the same amount of races as Norris, somehow.\n\nEven in Spain, after 50 laps Norris was only able to be ahead by 0.500 on Max.\n\nCould very well be that on tracks where Mclaren and Red Bull are closer together, the scale tips in favor of RBR next time because of this."", 'Did you read the article?', 'Race won’t. They seem to be most invested in competitive dynamics for the season', 'Temperatures and tyre degradation was the decider. Red Bull never had a chance in Spain. With a 2-stopper for everyone and no SC the McLarens were likely finishing 30+ seconds ahead of Verstappen.', ""Max did a Hail Mary strategy of a 3-stopper and still didn't stand a chance against the slower McLaren.\n\nWithout the heavy traffic from lap 38 onward he may have overtaken Norris after his 3rd stop, but I doubt he would have caught Piastri. And Norris would have been still close enough to get that 2nd place back.""]",0,14,0.37,0,12,12,0,14,0.37,0
