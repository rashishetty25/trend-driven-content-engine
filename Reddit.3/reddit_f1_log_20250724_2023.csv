Put whatever interests you behind the name and or use Verstappen, Alsonso, etc and it ledes with something that sounds concrete and you get a 500 word speculative piece that is one sentence alluding to the title and the rest is fluff. 

Have we reached a point yet where a meaningful, well developed story is more interesting or do people prefer they quick 500 word speculative pieces? 

And if you prefer a well developed story where does one find that? 

Example, the Horner dismissal, I prefer reading something that once all the information has been vetted and checked the story is put forth.
