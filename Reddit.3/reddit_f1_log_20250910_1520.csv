I was second. I came to the, um, to the grid and I spoke with him. You know, the track is really bad. You know, his aquaplaning, it will be a disaster if we restart the race now. And I knew that the race was about to restart soon. He(Webber) said that I entered in his mind that the track was worse than what actually it was. And and he crashed after the restart.

1nd36kq,My Completely Unrealistic 2026 Season Wishlist,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nd36kq/my_completely_unrealistic_2026_season_wishlist/,2025-09-10, Discussion,"This is my list of things I don't see as realistic, but would love to happen, to really kick off the new regulations with a bang. This my first post here y'all so please be gentle lol

1. Both the Aston and the Ferrari are beasts, so I can potentially see one last head-to-head dog fight between Lewis and Fernando. The two drivers that turned me from a casual fan to an F1 diehard, getting the chance at a truly storybook send-off at the top of the sport would be dope
2. Two and Three are connected, but I actually do hope Hadjar gets the ""promotion"" and absolutely kills it. It would be so much fun to watch someone go at it with Max in equal machinery. Max is genuinely one of the most fun and exciting drivers I have seen, and I always felt cheated that Daniel kinda ran from the challenge against him. I think Hadjar is a dog and ROTY, it would be cinema.
3. Because this is a new regulation cycle and all the PUs are brand new, technically, this would be the first year VCARB might actually live up to its ""sister team"" moniker and be on equal footing. If Yuki and Lawson are their drivers, there is a real fun thought experiment that Red Bull can do, the main car can be an aggressive, unhinged monster, while the VCARB can be a more balanced affair on equal PU with no hand-me-downs. Watching them this year has made me excited for the two teams to actually duke it out next year.
4. This is where it goes off the deep end. Both Bottas and/or Checo get podiums at COTA. I think it's cool to have an American works team in the biggest motorsport in the world, and call it bias, but I do think it would be a wonder for the sport for casual American fans to feel they might have a competitive team. I know Haas is also American, but they are, without a doubt, the poorest team in F1, and having Cadillac build an aura similar to the Tifosi would be cool.
5. In my hypothetical 99.99% won't happen dream season, Ferrari and Aston would be fighting out for the WCC. And I pray Williams just comes out of nowhere to beat both McLaren and Mercedes. We have had the same four teams at the top of the pecking order for so long. It would be so refreshing to see a true customer team (I say this just because Williams doesn't make a road car) in the mix. Also, their colors, kits, and drivers just scream Formula 1 to me; they feel Nostalgic!
6. This is a tiny one, but an Ollie/Gabi Podium or win would be dope just coz these two have been so refreshing this season. Ollie has been so impressive; I feel like Ferrari has their driver of the future, and Gabi just has this aggression and feel for the sport that is cool. (This one is definitely just for the vibes)
7. I did the worst math on earth, and the 2026 cars look like they'll be the smallest they have been since 2016/2017, so I'm on my hands and knees begging the universe for more fights. This season has made me feel like all the drivers have been in handcuffs, and I get the feeling they just want to let out. Zandvoort was a pretty good race because a lot of the drivers came back from the break with elbows out

That's it that's the wishlist. I would love to hear everyone's thoughts. I don't think any of these will happen but new season, new regs if this isn't the time for wishful thinking when is.

P.S.: Yes, I am a Ferrari fan, Williams is my midfield team of choice, and watching the king Hulkenberg bring a podium to my favorite backmarker team (I hate kick, Stake and the pickle rick green btw I liled them as Alfa Romeo and Charles is my guy of the current era) brought a tear to my eye.","['I need Williams to build a rocketship and have Alex win the WDC.\n\n  \nI strongly, STRONGLY believe he is a capable enough driver.

1ndcqhg,Whatever happened to Pascal Wehrlein?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ndcqhg/whatever_happened_to_pascal_wehrlein/,2025-09-10, Discussion,"I remember in 2016, everybody was hyping up Wehrlein as the next best thing. He scored a point in a Manor, a car that should've been pointless in every season. He convincingly defeated Haryanto, and was mostly ahead of Ocon too (though it was much closer).

Yet it was Ocon who got the seat in the far superior Force India car, whilst Wehrlein was booted to Sauber. In 2016, the Sauber was no better than the Manor. According to the points chart, Wehrlein's head to head racing record against Ericsson wasn't overly convincing, but he still scored two points finishes in a car that was effectively no better than a Manor.

But then he was booted out of the team in favour of Charles Leclerc, and we never heard from him again. What happened to him? How did he go from a driver people were hyping up as the next Lewis Hamilton to this?","['He went to Formula E, won a championship and came third in the most recent one.', ""Motorsports isn't just F1... he's had success in Formula E and stints in DTM and endurance series since then."", 'He had a really bad crash in race of champions which resulted in a compression fracture in a vertebrae in his neck,  so he couldnt get his neck in shape and missed the start of the 2017 season.  Combined with his previous piss-poor attitude the team (and the paddock) moved on and he has a fine career in lesser series.', ""He was a driver that was in F1 at the wrong time really as money played more of a role. Should've stayed over Ericsson but Ericsson's sponsors had majority share in the team. Williams was also an other option but they preferred the money from Stroll and Sirotkin. Everywhere else had no openings for him so he found himself out of the sport \n\nHe was apparently considered for the Force India team for the 17 season but they preferred working with Ocon from the testing they did with both drivers. So he missed that opportunity as well.\n\nHe's doing well for himself though. Races for Porsche in Formula E where he has been a champion and could very well win more titles."", ""The Sauber part is simple, Marcus Ericsson was favored by Sauber. There was some big Swedish money behind Sauber for some years that favored Marcus, and Marcus brought other funding as well.\n\nIt's not uncommon for drivers to be displaced from a seat for a year especially early in their careers. It happened to Esteban, it happened to Alex, to KMag, to Hulk, it is a thing that happens for one reason or another. Alex did DTM in his off year, just like Pascal did the year after leaving F1. Pascal was even on the Mercedes team, so clearly they hadn't abandoned him yet. I wouldn't have been surprised at all if Pascal got another F1 shot after a year off... except for Charles Leclerc. \n\nCharles Leclerc demolished Ericsson as a rookie, which a rookie outscoring a non-rookie teammate hasn't even happened since. (George could be mentioned, but Kubica did score that one time, and also, let's be real, Kubica wasn't a normal veteran.) Suddenly, it didn't matter that Pascal was better than Ericsson, because Ericsson was out of a seat himself.\n\nThe earlier parts I don't know much about. I didn't watch then and haven't looked into it. Both of them were Mercedes juniors. I'm not sure if Pascal was managed by Toto or not like Ocon is. Maybe Ocon was favored from that. Maybe it was because like you said, Ocon was immediately nearly on pace with Pascal, even though Pascal received preseason testing and 12 races before Esteban got there."", 'Like some people have said, at Sauber Ericsson was favoured due to a majority of the team being owned by swedish sponsors, which put pressure on him being made priority by the team. He still beat Ericsson if I remember right, but not by enough a margin to make a name for himself. It was the same thing with Nasr in 2016, you can assume that it was the same inner scenario with Charles in 2018, but Leclerc intubated Ericsson anyways.\n\nAlso, as someone else pointed out, Wehrlein had a bad relationship with his team, and that always creates a stain thats hard to wash. I dont think he changed much either, last I heard he was also having some petty spats with his teammate in Formula E.', 'This post could have been a Google search.', 'IIRC they said he was a bit of a diva in the pits with the mechanics and engineers back then, and in the race they ended up 3-3 (not counting DNFs) with Ocon arriving halfway through the season.', 'Hype is a fickle thing.

1ncomu6,Thought experiment with Oscar v Lando,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ncomu6/thought_experiment_with_oscar_v_lando/,2025-09-09, Statistics,"After last weekend, I decided to run a little experiment. It turned out to be more eye-opening than I expected, because I thought it would confirm something I already believed‚Äîbut instead, it showed me something completely different.

With a little help from AI, I used random number generation to adjust Oscar Piastri‚Äôs form to reflect how he performed last year.

Looking back at all of his finishes from 2024, his average was 5.1 with a standard deviation of 3.0. So the idea was to simulate his current season as if he hadn‚Äôt improved, using last year‚Äôs stats as the baseline. I thought this would create a model where Lando was clearly McLaren‚Äôs number one driver.

My assumption going in was that, if Oscar wasn‚Äôt consistently near the front, Max Verstappen would be seriously challenging Lando and might be ahead. 

Here‚Äôs how I set it up: I left all other drivers‚Äô positions untouched and just dropped Oscar into lower finishing spots based on that statistical profile, promoting the drivers ahead of him. For example, in my model he finished third at Spa instead of winning. There were a few other adjustments like that, but he still only finished outside the points once and even got two wins, which felt realistic.

What I actually ended up with was Lando leading Max by about 70 points. Behind them, there‚Äôs roughly a 60-point gap to George Russell, followed by Charles and Oscar close together, about 50 points ahead of Lewis, with Kimi and Alex another 50 points back.

So what I learned is this: Lando has improved drastically this year, even when you assume Oscar‚Äôs form stayed at last year‚Äôs level.

I‚Äôm Australian, so of course I‚Äôd love to see Oscar win the whole thing, but I‚Äôll happily say this: Lando is fantastic this year. And unsurprisingly, even in this model, McLaren is running away with the Constructors‚Äô Championship.","['There‚Äôs a reason people get degrees in statistics and other fields. \n\nWhat you‚Äôve done is throw darts in the dark to draw a conclusion with no objective meaning. \n\nJust saying ‚ÄúAI‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make something meaningful or correct.\n\nOf course Lando has been good.

You don‚Äôt need any weird statistical manipulation to tell you that.', '""If you just change everything, everything will appear different""\n\n\n-Will Buxton', ""Maybe im taking it at too simplictic of a level, but how does making Oscar run worse peove Landos improvement?\n\nWhat happens when you run the same stats against Lando comapred to this year?\n\nDid you include McLarens technical inprovements and mid-speed corner dominance into the equation?\n\nI still feel that a drivers biggest push to improve comes from his own team mate's performance and data comparison. If you're cruising over your team mate, and winning against other teams comfortably, there isnt the pressure to find those extra 0.010's."", "">\xa0Lando has improved drastically this year\n\nHow did you conclude that Lando improved and not that McLaren's car did relative to the rest of the field?"", '""I left all other drivers‚Äô positions untouched and just dropped Oscar into lower finishing spot""\n\n\nSo you arbitrarily made Oscar worse in your game, so Oscar ended up worse. I don\'t want to be too sarcastic but that is hardly surprising.\n\n\nAlso, your conclusion is that Norris improved much? Isn\'t that like killing Batman and concluding Robin is amazing? I mean, yeah, if you make one of the two title contenders worse in your game, the remaining one wins.', "">Lando has improved drastically this year, even when you assume Oscar‚Äôs form stayed at last year‚Äôs level.\n\nWhy would you make the assumption that Piastri's form has stayed the same as last year? It has been well-documented -- both by Piastri and by McLaren -- how he has applied himself to address the shortcomings that he had in 2024, and I think you would be hard-pressed to argue that he has not improved as a result."", 'so you entered data and and lowered oscars finishes to make it "" realistic "" and then deduced that lando has improved, informative.......\n\nDid you know if we lowered all of maxs finishes statiscally yuki has improved', '""With a little help from AI"" girl no', 'Sorry mate.
