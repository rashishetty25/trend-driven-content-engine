Hamilton and Raikkonen you can debate as well.

When do you think it was the beginning of the end for him, why was it so abrupt and did you ever get a glimpse of hope from him after that?

Personally even if he's a gentleman and won four WDC's, he's probably one of the least impressive multichampions as there were very few instances of him making the most out of bad machinery. For me it was Hockenheim 2018 when he was never the same after that.

I think a combination of being comfortably beaten by Leclerc, having a woeful car in 2020 and the likelihood of a fifth title slipping away really destroyed his confidence and motivation.', ""He's probably the weakest 3x plus champion better he's stronger than some double WDC's. \n\nI don't think his decline was linear. I think he was very car sensitive. He was obviously good through 2008-2013 but possibly not always as good as he looked. In 2009, 2010 and the first half of 2012 Webber was closer than he would have been to a truly generational driver. \n\nObviously Ricciardo was better than him in 2014 but I think Vettel had a strong 2015. He then seemed to get slightly worse every year from then on."", '2020 knowing he would lose his seat and having that shit car. I think his motivation was gone and the decline was very big', 'I mean yeah it was general opinion around his prime that he wasn’t the best driver on the grid especially in 2012. That wasn’t the case when I was growing up with Schumer or even Max now', 'Get Vettel in a car that suits and he was a machine. One of the best, consistent, fast, great on tyres.  \n\nIn the earlier championship years, he wasn’t the greatest at wheel to wheel, but it rarely mattered and when it did, he normally managed to keep it together. I think a lot of was poor risk assessment, we had seen that in races throughout his career. \n\nEven in cars that weren’t great, there were glimpses of his talent (Silverstone, Japan, Singapore 2014, 2016 wasn’t terrible in a pretty lacklustre car, 2015 was very strong but car was decent). Much of this I class as a motivational issue, seen the same with Hamilton from time to time, once it’s clear you’re not racing for anything, then the extra few percent above the others goes away, often until a race a driver particularly enjoys comes and you see them reappear. \n\nI’m not sure Germany was the cliff drop everyone says it was, he come back in Spa, and Ferrari fumbled their development shortly after which stumbled his run for 2018, towards the end when Ferrari reverted to older spec the speed came back, but others has progressed in that time. \n\nUltimately I think it was the internal politics of Ferrari getting in the way, once Marchionne was gone, it was well rumoured Ferrari split into two camps, and the team wide support was gone. 2017 wouldn’t have helped, where Vettel crashed himself out of real contention for the WDC. This was his biggest career mistake, in an otherwise very strong season. \n\nHe brought the only real challenge to Mercedes/Hamilton until 2021, when his teammate was nowhere, podium most races in 2015/2016. In a car that suits him I put him above drivers like RIC, alongside ALO, NOR, but below HAM, VER.', ""Vettel was never a brilliant driver. Both Hamilton and Alonso commented on this when he was dominating. When he doesn't have a car that's clearly faster, he showed that he wasn't all that great. Good driver but not brilliant\n\n\nTo quote Hamilton : “I think lots of people in the paddock wish they could have Adrian’s car so they could show that they’re just as competitive as Sebastian,” Hamilton said. “Fernando, for me, is more accurate. He hits all the apexes.\n\n“Sebastian misses four apexes on a single lap and still goes quickest. He goes off and he still goes quickest. And I think ‘Holy crap, I couldn’t do that lap even if I was on the limit’. His car is just that far ahead of everyone else’s.”"", 'He was very smart, understanding all the rules and would use that \nOften would make the calls to change tyres early\nThis paid off some times, failed others', ""Kevin Magnussen has actually shared a theory. He mentioned himself, Lewis, and Ricciardo, but I could imagine Vettel also falling into this category.\n\n[https://www.planetf1.com/news/kevin-magnussen-lewis-hamilton-daniel-ricciardo-ground-effect-f1-car-struggles](https://www.planetf1.com/news/kevin-magnussen-lewis-hamilton-daniel-ricciardo-ground-effect-f1-car-struggles)\n\nA ChatGPT summary of the article:\n\n>Former Haas driver Kevin Magnussen has identified a trend linking the struggles of himself, Lewis Hamilton, and Daniel Ricciardo with the current generation of Formula 1 cars that utilize ground effect aerodynamics. Magnussen suggests that their aggressive driving styles, particularly their proficiency in braking, may not align well with the demands of these cars. He notes that the ground effect vehicles are unique in that they do not respond well to simultaneous braking and turning, requiring a more 'V-style' approach to cornering. Additionally, Magnussen points out that the current tires add another layer of complexity, contributing to the difficulties faced by these drivers.\n\nKevin has actually talked about this for a few years now. I believe he said that when he returned to F1 in 2022, he did notice there was a significant change in how he had to drive the car, but thought he was still doing well. When he was up against a very skilled teammate in Hulkenberg, it became apparent that his driving style just could not be translated well with these cars after the regulation changes.\n\nSo if Vettel has the same driving style, this could be one of the reasons why. The cars might have already begun being set up in a way that did not suit his driving style long before 2022. It does make sense that more downforce would make it harder for drivers to brake and turn at the same time, punishing those who have always driven with a 'U-style' approach.""]",0,127,0.4,0,113,113,0,7,0.030000000000000027,0

Im sure Lando will want another year or two behind Max and being cool with it.  FFS.  The stupid headlines these days.', ""If he puts in performances like Abu Dhabi and Baku last year he'll easily be in the fight, it's just about cutting down on the needless mistakes that were present in Brazil and even the double yellows in Qatar if Lando can get on top of that he really has no reason not to be a contender, and even win this season, I don't think his wheel to wheel racing is actually as poor as people make it out to be, it's just when you're going up against the greatest wheel to wheel racer on the grid right now it'll undoubtedly be tougher then racing anybody else. If Lando also keeps Oscar in check throughout the year which he's done pretty well over these past two seasons he'll probably have a shot against either Leclerc or Verstappen both of whom I expect to be his main competitors."", 'If they have a strong car at the beginning of the season, it’s possible', 'Yeah, he’s proven he learns and grows all the time.

McLaren had the fastest car... Ferrari was close, but they are changing their car significantly, who knows if that'll work or not.  Verstappen dragged that Red Bull kicking and screaming to the title by year's end - that team is playing catch up.  Mercedes also has ground to make up.  \n\n  \nWe'll how testing and week 1 shakes out...but I imagine it is Lando's title to lose unless McLaren somehow really botch the car."", ""Well if they have a fastest car he just has to beat Piastri, which he has done very well for 2 seasons. Very very difficult though if it's a 3 way fight between Ferrari Mclaren and Redbull."", 'McLaren always said 2025 is the year they expect to be competing for championships so if they bring a car that can competes for wins from the get go then I don’t see why Lando doesn’t have a better chance than last year.
