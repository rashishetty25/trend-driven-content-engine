The better the reputation and the position in the world championship, the quicker the team listens to your wishes.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our¬†[guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our¬†[FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika H√§kkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

And if so does anyone know what time ?', ""I made a simple web app to compare qualifying performance of drivers with their teammates. You can see how well a driver did (H2H, mean and median gap) against their teammate\n\n* over a season\n* over all qualifying sessions they took part in as teammates \n* against all his teammates at a particular circuit\n\nI compared times from sessions both drivers participated in. I.e. if driver A made it to Q3 and driver B got out in Q1, then their Q1 times were used. This means results such as Norris v Piastri in 2025 Saudi went to Norris because he crashed and couldn't set a Q3 time but was faster in Q2.\n\nThere is also a fourth feature where you can see how far off a driver's best time is from the fastest driver for every quali session in a season. I thought it would be interesting to see how the gap to the fastest changes over a year (like how Verstappen got closer and closer to Mercedes in 2020, or how Alonso got further away in 2023).\n\nData was fetched from the Jolpica (formerly Ergast) API. Only data from the 1994 season onwards is available (so unfortunately no Prost v Senna). There is also a lot of data from the late 90s and early 2000s seasons missing, so you may find it weird that only 32 results for Coulthard v Hakkinen across their career are shown.\n\nI am planning to make a post here about it but wanted some feedback first. I'm not a frontend guy so excuse the basic layout and style, but if you could suggest a change that is simple enough and would improve the look of the site I'll do it.\n\nhttps://www.f1teammatequali.com/"", ""I heard Ted Kravitz say Gasly's car had to be stopped by hand by the William's mechanics. Does anyone have a clip? I'd like to see how they managed that lol"", 'Rosberg is back for Spain.', 'Which drivers champion won in the worst car?', 'Red Bull Collision Azerbaijan 2018. \nThis race was the first I ever watched and instantly got me hooked to the sport. But one thing I‚Äôve wondered for a long time is why the double DNF came after the collision between the 2. Wouldn‚Äôt some new tires and a front wing made at least Daniel able to continue racing. No videos or photos I‚Äôve seen have ever shown any irrepairable damage. Can anyone explain to me? I feel like drivers have recovered from much worse', 'Which cars are suited best for Barcelona?', ""Thanks to u/Blanchimont, u/No_Cauliflower7877, u/djwillis1121 for answering my long list of questions. I have a few more:\n\n\n\n1. Why did Hamilton go to Ferrari, I understand Ferrari is a great team, correct me if I am wrong, but Ferrari is not looking like a winner or having even a good environment currently.\n\n2. Why did Sainz and Albon go to Williams (and when). I am asking cause the 2019 season was very good for both of them. Did something drastic happen in the 5 years since?\n\n3. Why is Alonso in Aston Martin, he can get podiums and win races, so why don't other teams try to get him.\n\n4. Lando Norris, what's up with him? Like a general question.\n\n5. How big of a difference is between a McLaren and say a Redbull or Mercedes purely on basis of car. Redbull, Ferrari and Mercedes have enough expertise to build a strong car, so how come McLaren has such a strong car that they are currently winning a lot (ofcourse they have good drivers, but other than that).\n\n6. What is DRS, does it mean that you can overtake the driver in front, how do you calculate that?\n\n7. Do teams have tactics to promote one driver over the other? For example in qualifying in Monaco, they can have the number 2 driver go slow preventing drivers Piastri or Hamilton etc from having a good position (took example of Monaco cause overtaking is difficult)."", 'First time watching F2, who‚Äôs the Sky commentators for the practice?', 'Got Sky F1 on and just watched a snippet on Driver Extraction training etc,   wish they did more on stuff like this and longer in depth segments...more behind the scenes stuff please Sky F1, i found it interesting']",3,33,0.67,3,28,28,1,10,0.07000000000000006,1
