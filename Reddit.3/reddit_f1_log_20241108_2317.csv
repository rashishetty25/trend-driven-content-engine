Disappointing.', 'This are good News tbh. Lets Not forget that mercs stake on their Team is only 33%.', ""People making fun of RBR being just a sports drink brand, they'll soon be more European and closer to racing then actual car brands.\xa0"", '> Formula 1 is booming worldwide. Thanks to cost caps, growing interest from sponsors and increasing income from the sale of rights, the first teams are now operating profitably. Whereas it used to be necessary to invest millions in racing, it will soon be possible to earn real money with Formula 1.\n\n> One consequence of this is that the racing teams are increasing in value. Even small teams such as Haas or Toro Rosso are now valued at over a billion euros. And because this is an illustrious circle of teams that is not so easy to get into from the outside, the trend is even increasing.\n\n> Some racing teams have started to literally capitalize on the development and sell shares. In June 2023, for example, Alpine announced that it had sold 24% of the team to a group of investors including actor Ryan Reynolds, golfer Rory McIlroy, boxer Anthony Joshua and football stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce.\n\n> In mid-September, the British website “Sky” reported that the US investment companies HPS and Accel were planning to invest in the Aston Martin Formula 1 team. Between 20 and 25 percent of the shares are to change hands. The deal is expected to increase the valuation of the racing team to at least 1.8 billion euros.\n\n> And according to information from auto motor und sport, Audi is also on the verge of concluding a deal with an investor. The purchase of the Sauber racing team was only completed at the beginning of the year. However, because the value of the racing team has already risen considerably since the deal was concluded, Audi can now really cash in.\n\n> Rumor has it that a suitable partner has already been found. The Qatar sovereign wealth fund wants to acquire a minority stake in the new works team. The emirate already owns shares in Volkswagen and Porsche. Now the billionaire investor from the Middle East is investing its money in the premier class for the first time.\n\n> The fresh money is likely to be used by Audi to further expand the Hinwil site. Here, the increase in personnel and infrastructure has not yet been completed. The car manufacturer would therefore not have to draw on its own reserves as a result of the Qatar deal.\n\n> Audi itself did not want to confirm the sale of shares in its F1 racing team. When asked by auto motor und sport, the company merely stated: “We are not involved in speculation. The team is not for sale.” However, the sale of a minority share would not be ruled out.\n\n> Even if it is not clear how high the sold share is, Audi will certainly retain control and not allow itself to be talked into decisions. According to our information, the negotiations began some time ago and are not a reaction to the current economic situation.\n\n> Managing Director Gernot Döllner said back in September at the race in Monza that the team’s involvement was not in question and was a long-term decision: “The decision was well prepared two and a half years ago and reassessed last year. We are firmly convinced that Formula 1 and Audi are a perfect match. It is in line with our strategy.”\n\n> The deal with Qatar could also be lucrative for Audi beyond the pure investment. The direct connection naturally opens up numerous opportunities at sponsor level. Qatar Airways is already active as a series partner in Formula 1. It is quite possible that the airline’s logos will soon be seen on the racing cars from Hinwil.\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)', 'Shit']",493,65,0.98,493,63,63,66,5,0.010000000000000009,66

The cameras zoom in excessively and are constantly moving. This makes it nearly impossible to distinguish the car from the background. It's really difficult to understand what the car is doing—whether it's sliding or running wide. Sometimes it's even dizzying because all I can see is a fragment of a moving car.

You can better understand what I mean by watching older F1 videos. Here's an example:

⑴ The aftermath of Azerbaijan is where the “fraud alert” insults against Albon began to circulate because Colapinto, on paper, out qualified him in just his second race. Completely ignoring the fact that both drivers made it into Q3 but the only reason Albon wasn't able to complete an additional lap is because his mechanics left a cooling fan atop his car. Despite this, Colapinto still finished the race behind Albon and has yet to still out-qualify him sans extenuating circumstances.

⑵ Albon was forced to retire after lap 5 due to cooling/PU issue.

⑶ Bottas collided with Albon, damaging Albon's front wing and diffuser. They were able to fix his wing at a premature pitstop but could do nothing about diffuser that cost him the race.

⑷ Albon was caught in a lap 1 racing incident with Gasly and Tsunoda. Colapinto would receive a 10 second time penalty and 2 penalty points for his incident with Liam Lawson.

⑸ Albon had a crash due in qualifying due to an engine failure that yes, James Vowles later confirmed was true. The damage being extensive enough that he was unable to start the race at all. Colapinto would crash in qualifying and later in the race behind a safety car.

**COMMENTARY**



Many have said that Alex is “feeling the pressure” and “being outperformed” by Franco which is why I thought it importent to outline the outcome of all races involving them because neither of these things are true and I feel as if Alex Albon is being unfairly maligned by those who seemingly begin watching the sport last night. Colopinto: 

• has yet to out-qualify ALB by his own merit. 

• has been unable to get into Q3 in three of his six races while his teammate has, and in each of these occasions he couldn't manage a Q2 entry either. 

• has only managed to capitalize on **one** P10 point finish out of **four** of his teammates compromised races.

• has racked up 2 penalty points, of which Albon & Sargeant managed to steer clear of all season.


And while we didn't include Sprints here, I want to further note that Logan Sargeant managed a higher Sprint finish this season in Miami (P10) compared to Franco's P12 finish in Austin, which is notable because the former managed to do so in a significantly overweight car.

What all of this 𝘥𝘰𝘦𝘴𝘯'𝘵 mean is that Franco is a poor driver by any stretch. What it 𝘥𝘰𝘦𝘴 mean, however, is that the idea that Franco is a second coming of Senna who's even close to beating his teammate in all metrics is categorically false and I'll no longer be gaslit about it.

It was Albon who gave Williams their highest race & sprint finish of the season, both of which occurred 𝘢𝘧𝘵𝘦𝘳 Colopinto joined the team.

Franco came in just as Williams delivered another upgrade and so far has shown himself to be standard rookie making standard mistakes and standard bouts of promise, but by all this accounts this means that he 𝘩𝘢𝘴𝘯'𝘵 exceeded expectations as the metric for that would be beating his teammate, which I feel I've sufficiently shown isn't true.

I open this up for discussion but want to reiterate that the topic is not about Alex Albon's season as a whole nor an opinion on whether or not Colapinto deserves a seat. This is strictly about the rather baseless claim that's in the title.


— Points finish stats were taken from [here](https://www.formula1.com/en/results/2024/races)

— I will update this post at the end of the season and if comments are fruitful ai will then make another post to discuss all 9 of Franco's races with this post as a reference.

I mean he's close to Albon or at least closer than Sargeant has been."", ""I don't disagree and I think the pace difference between the two is bigger than some people think. However Colapinto looks talented enough for F1 and clearly outperformed Logan and Albon has also had a few mistakes since Colapinto joined.

Cola is just outperfing expectations and I can understand people getting excited about it. He looks a real talent.\n\nEven though Sargent and Latifi were both bad, Alex's consistent battering of them I think is still incredibly impressive. And he only lost his qualifying streak because of the team putting a fan on the car. He'd probably like to be further ahead of Cola than he is but he also might have just had a few weekends not as his best and could bounce back again.

There is a subsection of people here that need to have at least one driver to hate on at any given point in time no matter the scenario and Perez is running out of steam and Ricciardo is gone so there was an opening that needed to be filled.

I agree that Alex isn't being destroyed and there were circumstances to take into consideration at some races.\n\nBut I also think that Franco already being decently close, and or matching or beating Alex at some races, casts doubt on Alex's hype and reputation from last year. Franco is a rookie who didn't really have a lot of hype behind him like Kimi. Franco was also unexpectedly thrown in with little to no preparation.\n\nMeanwhile Alex gained the reputation of vastly outperforming the car, and of being a driver who needs/deserves a seat at a top team again. Personally, Franco just brought Alex's hype a bit back down to earth for me. It doesn't mean Alex is a bad driver at all. Franco was a lot better than most expected, and Alex just might not be as amazing as I personally thought.

Why are some of you so against a change in track layout even if it produces terrible racing? I get clinging on to history but this isn't a museum, it's a place with a specific function. If you can't race on it it's not a racetrack. It's in the name.

I assume you mean that track that no longer works with F1 cars, but that's not the track's fault.

Even Le Mans Hypercars are smaller than F1 cars."", 'Do you have examples of outdated tracks that you find are thought of too affectionately?', ""It....depends. \n\nYou want to widen turn 12 at Cota?

While I rate Oscar highly, Lando has still been a clear step up from him these seasons. And right now he is up against one of the best in the history of F1.\xa0\n\nPeople used to say the same thing about Seb in 2018 and 2009, but he still finished well above his teammates. Webber fumbled 2010. People love to judge drivers who are super fast, but make occasional errors, rather than slightly slower drivers.\xa0', 'No, he’s not even close. In recent years Vettel’s 2018 was poor, Webber’s 2010 was mediocre, Massa was incredibly error prone in 2008, as was Montoya in 2003. Hakkinen won in 1999 but made really hard work of it.\n\nI don’t even particularly like Norris, but the criticism towards him has been so overboard lately. For all his flaws (racecraft, starts), he’s still easily outperformed Piastri, and he hasn’t made too many huge errors.
