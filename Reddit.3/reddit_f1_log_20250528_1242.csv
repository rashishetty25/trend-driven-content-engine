1kwoziz,Barcelona is not a bad circuit.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kwoziz/barcelona_is_not_a_bad_circuit/,2025-05-27, Discussion,"I have seen a lot of people on here and elsewhere commenting that the upcoming Spanish Grand Prix will likely not be great for overtaking and that this track is one of the most boring on the calendar. 

And that was right. Before they got rid of the last chicane. Since then it has actually been one of the very best tracks for overtaking. 

And in 2022 there were 50, the tenth highest total of the season. 

In 2023 there were 65 overtakes, the fifth highest total of the season.

And in 2024 there were 55 overtakes, the second highest tally of the whole season! 

And it's not slam dunk DRS overtakes either. The battles usually go right into the braking zone and last year Russell vs Norris even went through the whole of sector 1 and most of sector 2! That battle lasted over half a lap! https://youtu.be/6OpfnQFgvkw?si=WWkd6bLYIzYiCvsr

You can also defend but still have fun battles. A perfect example of this is Russell vs Verstappen in 2022 
https://youtu.be/XtT9tNfdAlM?si=1gvNKihBynCRMDqX

Furthermore there is fairly high tyrewear at this track and both 2023 and 2024 were two stoppers. 2022 was a three stopper. 

So I think we should be optimistic about this race because since the removal of that last chicane it has been a great circuit for racing!

The article is 99.9% about Monaco', 'It will fuck Ferrari over the most, somehow', 'Ferrari turnaround in Barcelona \n\nTranslation: \n\n> **Ferrari was further up front in Monaco than they had expected. Now, the team at Maranello is hoping that the new front wing rule will bring about a change in Barcelona.**\n\n> McLaren team principal Andrea Stella already knew it on Friday before the first practice session in Monaco. ""Ferrari is a contender for victory here."" At that point, his Ferrari colleague Frédéric Vasseur wouldn\'t have dared to make that statement. Especially not home driver Charles Leclerc: ""We thought Monte Carlo, with its slow corners, didn\'t suit us. Secretly, we hoped it would go like it did in 2021. We didn\'t have the best car then either, but we took pole position in Monte Carlo.""\n\n> After setting three fastest times in the free practice sessions, Ferrari\'s expectations increased. When Leclerc missed pole position by 0.111 seconds, Ferrari spoke of disappointment. ""When we came here, I thought a top-ten finish would be a challenge. Then we narrowly missed pole position and thus gave away the win. Compared to our original expectations, it was a good weekend. And yet, I\'m still annoyed not to have won.""\n\n> McLaren suddenly changed its tactics in Q3, setting two fast laps on its second attempt with a cool-down period in between. Ferrari opted not to, even though they\'ve recently performed better on used tires than on new ones.\n\n> Vasseur didn\'t see this as a decisive disadvantage in the battle for the fastest time: ""If you want to do something like that, you have to adjust your entire program from Friday onwards. We were considering the medium tire as an alternative. McLaren was simply very fast. They did 1:10.1 minutes on the first push lap. And that was with fuel for three laps on board.""\n\n> **Bumps and curbs help.**\nThe rule that the Ferrari SF-25 doesn\'t perform well in slow corners suddenly seemed to no longer apply. And Ferrari had nothing in its luggage other than a larger rear wing that would have explained the miraculous transformation.\n\n> Leclerc concluded: ""With one exception, Monte Carlo has only slow corners. This allowed us to focus entirely on that during the setup without having to accept many disadvantages in other areas.""\n\n> In fact, the Ferrari drivers only lost time between the Tabak curve and the Schwimmbad section. Last year\'s Monaco winner offered a second explanation: ""The track has a lot of bumps, and you have to go over the curbs a lot. Our car can handle that. Perhaps that compensated for our other weaknesses.""\n\n> **Other slow curves.**\nVasseur\'s statement on the supposed miracle was interesting: ""We don\'t fully understand it either. It could have something to do with the fact that the slow curves of Monte Carlo are different from the slow curves elsewhere. They are very slow.""\n\n> Even more crucially, due to the relatively low speed, Ferrari had little to worry about excessive wear on the crash barrier, allowing them to run at the ground clearance they considered ideal. ""We have less contact with the ground here. That also helps,"" admitted Vasseur.\n\n> The Frenchman admits that, despite the upturn in form in Monte Carlo, the team fell far short of expectations in the first third of the season. It looks as if Ferrari has fallen into the same trap it fell into in 2023. In an effort to address last year\'s weaknesses, the engineers overreacted and turned their old strengths into weaknesses. Now they\'re good in fast corners, but they gain less time there than in slow ones.\n\n> **McLaren with the ground clearance up.**\nMcLaren did better. The Papaya races lost their time in the slow sections in 2024. These are now the car\'s strengths, but without giving up much at the other end. While they\'re not as fast as Red Bull in the fast corners and not better than Ferrari, they\'re better overall. Stella offers a deeper insight: ""We can now run maximum downforce with a bit more ground clearance than last year."" With these cars, that translates to more mechanical grip.\n\n> The McLarens are generally better balanced than their rivals. The competition attributes this to the front wing, which flexes in such a way that the aero balance shifts from front to rear with increasing load. If stiffer front wings are now mandatory in Barcelona, \u200b\u200bMcLaren would lose the most, their rivals hope.\n\n> McLaren shrugs off the dreamers: ""We\'re not afraid of the new endurance tests. Nothing will change for us,"" promises Stella. His colleague Vasseur, on the other hand, believes: ""The new rule can be a game changer."" Vasseur\'s calculations are as follows: Ferrari was the most conservative in developing these flexible wings. Therefore, they also have the least to lose. Toto Wolff doesn\'t want to dismiss Vasseur\'s theory. ""Perhaps the Ferrari actually loses less than the other cars.""', ""Ok but what about an article about the Spain upgrade? Cause this article is *entirely* about Monaco. \n\nDon't bother clicking on it."", ""the change is from 15mm of flex to 10mm, and considering McLaren haven't bought any major updates yet, I imagine they're gonna bring big ones here to mitigate any problems the changes will cause, but I really don't think 5mm of difference will hurt McLaren at all"", 'No', 'Expect no change!', 'No', '[https://i.ibb.co/8D3ygPVG/me.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/8D3ygPVG/me.jpg)']",98,21,0.82,98,309,309,-1,0,0.0,-1

1kxe5me,Grand Prix Plaza Las Vegas,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kxe5me/grand_prix_plaza_las_vegas/,2025-05-28, Discussion,"Quick review of some components of the newly opened Grand Prix Plaza in Las Vegas, for those considering going.

Quickest background.  Netflix era F1 fan, watch every race, follow every social media account I can, etc.  I have a basic G29 steering wheel and pedal setup at home, and have played multiple seasons of all of the recent F1 games, although I have spent more time playing Gran Turismo 7 for the past two years.  Have never driven a proper racing sim setup with motion.

I arrived on a recent weekday morning around 1030am when the Plaza opened.  Talked to the Go Kart track employees for a few minutes about options for races, and decided to book a Mixed Race (~20mph or so) that is geared for all ages for $79.  Comes with two 15 minutes races, consisting of a qualifying session and then a grid start race.  Both sessions rankings are set by fastest lap only, to prevent the race session from being a block fest.  Blocking is easy to do as the track is pretty tight in most places, with a few decent opportunities to go 2 or maybe 3 wide and pass when needed.  Karts have functional DRS, which works by SLOWING the lead car, allowing the trailing car to pass.  Great concept in theory, but maddening when you're the lead car on a fast lap and you're artificially slowed down because someone is behind you.  Karts have functional ERS, which works great, is fun, but was not explained enough to the other drivers in my party who missed using it the entire first 15 minute session.  I used ERS to successfully get pole lap out of 10 drivers.   10 drivers on a grid made for 20 was pretty good, only a few bottlenecks during each session - the track workers are pretty good with telling people to move over, etc.   Overall, I enjoyed it for the price, my party members who are not F1 fans thought it was a blast, and I would do it again at the mixed race level or the nightly elite races which are 30 mph and I'm sure way more fun (I would have done the 30 mph race but did not have time in my schedule).

The arcade simulators was my most anticipated component of the event, as I'm an avid F1 game racer with a basic setup and hadn't ever used a Sim.  Cost is $40 for 9 time trial laps around the Vegas circuit.   The chair and wheel and pedal all seem to be pretty mid to high level in quality, but the game engine is a major fucking letdown.  All of the driver assists are on, and there is no way to turn them off.  The camera is halo, and can not be changed to cockpit for full immersion.  The game steers, brakes, and shifts for you around the circuit even if you try to override the shifts, or brake slightly earlier than the settings.  This setting is helpful for average tourists, but for anyone who has ever spent any time playing the F1 game or any other racing game, it is not worth the money.  If anyone from F1 or the GPP is reading this, theres got to be a way to change the settings for amateur or frequent players of racing games - your new F1 arcades across the world and this GPP will not bring in repeat customers otherwise.  As someone who loves F1 and racing games, I would not ever spend money on their Sim racing games again unless this was changed.  Just my $0.02.

There's a small store, restaurant, and museum on the second floor of the paddock.  I skipped the museum due to time, but walked into the empty restaurant at the northern end of the paddock  building at 11am just to see it and the menu.  Menu looked good and i would definitely try it once.  Restaurant decor was a bit sparse, but the views over T1 were very cool.  To get to the restaurant, you walk the entire length of the paddock and you can walk the exterior balcony and oversee the entire front stretch, which is very cool.  I had a drink at the bar near the store, which was high quality and around $21 (mid range price for Vegas cocktails).  Did not buy anything at the store, but they had a good selection and prices seemed cheaper than on race day (I'm not really a merch guy).

Overall, Go Karts were great, Sims were bad, restaurant incomplete but outlook positive, bar was good, atmosphere and access for a walk in patron were great.","['tbh sounds like a tourist trap and something to avoid as an F1 fan.\n\nKarting sounds very expensive and gimmicky and any local kart track would give a better experience. For example, my local track has loads of options, but at the top level is their £75 package of a 5 lap practice/quali, 15 lap heat and 20 lap final race, on a wide flowing tarmac track with kerbing and karts of 40-50mph.\n\nAs you say, the sim is utterly pointless if every assist is on for every driver.', ""Holy shit, these US prices.

Stupid question, but do you need to pay admission for a 2 year old?"", 'Watching Yuki\'s driving at Red Bull vs at VCARB is really... jarring.\n\nI\'ve been pretty much exclusively watching him (and Hadjar) this season through each race. When Yuki was in VCARB, he had actual guts. He\'d push the car to it\'s limit and end up pulling some sick results or floundering and DNF-ing. But it made him look like a driver with skill and potential; just one who took unreasonable risks sometimes. This led to him outperforming all his teammates except Gasly.\n\nAnd I do get that the Red Bull is obviously and very clearly an absolute pain in the ass to drive. The upgrades are working for Max, but again we\'re going through the same cycle every single RB second seat except Daniel has suffered. \n\nBut I guess I\'d expect to at least see some of the same driving mentality Yuki had in AT/VCARB from the start. But it\'s like he\'s just a completely different driver. He doesn\'t push the car in qualifying at all and plays it incredibly safe; not to Lawson\'s level, but not much better. We get into a race, and he takes 0 chances at overtakes. He loses out on straights to Aston Martin and Haas in a car we at least know is faster than those two. Monaco wasn\'t his fault at all really within the race, it was just his Q2 times that needed to be better. Buta part from that, again I just feel I\'m watching a different driver. He\'s not even visibly trying to defend. The confidence in the car is NOT there, even though we\'ve seen moments where he HAS kept up, to some degree, with Max. FP in Monaco, Yuki and Max were pretty much matched on medium tyres.\n\nHe really feels like he\'s just cloned Checo from mid-late 2024. Which I guess is indicative of the car being an ass to drive, which we all know already. And if I get a reply on here it\'s gonna be ""he\'s just a mediocre driver."" But even if that turns out to be true by the time his career\'s over; it doesn\'t feel like we\'re seeing him drive how he has before at the moment. It\'s taking too long for him to get used to the car, and personally I\'m just hoping something clicks soon and he at least starts putting in some early-to-mid Checo era performances. He\'s a capable driver in a rough spot right now, and I\'m hoping he turns it around.', 'Leclerc is 6-1 against Hamilton so far. The only reason Leclerc finished behind Hamilton in Imola is because he was on old tires. He is dominating him so far.

I'm a long time Formula 1 fan, however I've never been to a race in person.

I'm from Argentina and I know that Interlagos is a logistical nightmare to visit (both the circuit and Sao Pablo are famously uncomfortable places to visit).

Therefore, I was thinking in going to some Middle Eastern circuit. 
I know that the experience in person can vary significantly from watching the race on site from the TV. So, anyone has any recommendation on which of those gives you a more enjoyable experience?

Many thanks in advance.","['Bahrain is one of the best circuits on the Calendar in general and the best in Middle east.
