Back in 2022 we had that mess of a tractor on track under heavy conditions, which let to Neils picking up from Freitas. A massive lapse in judgement over safety given how horrible Gaslys onboard felt at the time, barely being able to see it even as he's going past. In Gaslys own words if he was two metres to the left he would have been dead. 

And then you have Jules Bianchi's tragic death, where he lost control and crashed into a recovery vehicle, on the very same track in 2014.

I'm not sure exactly what the rules are regarding recovery vehicles,  but I personally think that if you need to grab a recovery crane to remove a car from the track, it should be red flagged. The corner Carlos spun out on sure was slower, but you don't have to hit a tractor that fast for it to be lethal. 

It can't be a coincidence the last two times we have had a change in Race Director have been races where there is a live racetrack while a recovery vehicle is within the bounds of the overall circuit enclosure. idk. Maybe it's something entirely different or maybe it's down to some kind of misapplied judgement when it comes to the use of recovery vehicles. 

What do you think?","['We had delays in red flags to let people complete laps but they didn‚Äôt actually let the people complete the laps in the end meaning neither safety nor entertainment got prioritised and everyone was unhappy.\n\nWe had marshals pushing a car back onto the track and nobody realising for a while.

1gqigpv,What will the cars be like in 2025/2026 based on the regulations?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gqigpv/what_will_the_cars_be_like_in_20252026_based_on/,2024-11-13, Technical,"Newbie fan here, so apologies for my ignorance of the subject!

I keep hearing about 2026 being the year in which new regulations will apply, and this appears to mean fundamentally redesigned cars? 

My question is: Given that, this year, it‚Äôs been quite competitive between a few teams in terms of car performance, will next year‚Äôs 2025 season be likely to be similar? That is, if next year‚Äôs regulations are similar, then presumably the teams (focussing on 2026), will be applying moderate improvements to the existing cars for 2025, rather than entirely new designs?

Additionally, does anyone know yet how different the cars might have to be under the new, upcoming regulations?

I‚Äôm curious because I‚Äôve found the last few months really exciting with all the different teams/drivers that have been able to win and I‚Äôd like that to continue!","['2025 will likely carry on being super close - unless one team would decide to do the opposite and instead sacrifice 2026 a bit to go for a better car this year. However they wouldn‚Äôt necessarily even succeed these cars are so tricky to develop. So in all likelihood 2025 will look similar to this year. However 2026 will have so many changes to Aero and Power units that there‚Äôs a good chance one team will get it way better than the rest and lead the way. However we really have no idea what 2026 will look like.', 'Big change for 2026 is moveabe aerodynamics, both the front and rear wings will be able to move between 2 modes for top speed and grip.\n\nMuch more power coming from the electrical energy with a 50/50 split between fuel and battery power.\n\nCars slightly smaller, 8 inches shorter, 4 inches narrower, 30kg lighter.\n\nRear wings will have traditional endplates rather than the current curved single profile.\n\n30% less downforce and 55% less drag. \n\nMove away from ground effect to over body aero.\n\nAs regards 2025, as you get to a mature set of regulations things usually close up as teams converge on the best solutions and the rule of diminishing returns means there is less time to be found.\n\nSo expect it to be even closer than this season with potentially more teams joining the battle at the front.', "">presumably the teams (focussing on 2026), will be applying moderate improvements to the existing cars for 2025, rather than entirely new designs?\n\nNo, you can expect each team to design a completely new car for next year. There are certain changes that the teams cannot apply to an existing car, such as the cooling layout and homologated parts like impact structures, so it's better to start from a clean sheet. \n\nAlso, teams can only start working on the 2026 car from the 1st of January onward, so they don't have to compromise on either year's car.
