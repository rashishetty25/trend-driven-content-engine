1iecrvx,Exclusive: new FIA technical directive on wing flexing ready,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iecrvx/exclusive_new_fia_technical_directive_on_wing/,2025-01-31, News,"Translation of the article in comments, as required for articles not in English ","[""#Translation \n\nIn the last season the topic of wing flexing has come back into fashion and how some teams manage to 'bypass' the FIA static checks by making the first macroelement hit by the flow flex dynamically. The technical office of the Federation has always declared all the als legal, however, under the continuous complaints and requests for clarification by the various teams, there has been no lack of tightening up regarding the elasticity checks of the ailerons with the usual technical directives that have also arrived during the season.\n\nNew Technical Directive: The FIA had announced that it would not add further tests \n\nLast year, during the Belgian GP weekend , the Federation introduced dedicated cameras to monitor the flex of the front wings through the now classic adhesive dots placed in some strategic positions. Nikolas Tombazis, in an interview with Motorsport, had declared that the tests to measure the flex of the front wings will not undergo changes in 2025. The head of single-seaters for the FIA had in fact underlined the difficulty of developing standardized tests due to the variability of aerodynamic loads between the different cars, making it difficult to replicate real race conditions in the laboratory. However, the issue of controlling excessive flex is still the subject of attention . Not so much in terms of new tests, but rather in terms of updating the current ones, which according to Tombazis have not been changed since 2022.\n\nIt is widely believed that the progress made by Mercedes , Ferrari and especially McLaren is also due to the new specifications of more flexible front wings. One of the most important problems that engineers have to face with these new generation ground effect cars is finding the right balance, because they tend to understeer in slow corners and oversteer in fast ones. According to some important insiders, one way to do this is to think of a 'flexible' front wing that varies its load significantly at various speeds , so as to have flaps that generate more load in slow corners, to counteract understeer, but which then lose angle of attack at high speeds, so as not to make the car too oversteer. This is seen as a good way to control the aerodynamic balance.\n\nFIA wants to approve a new technical directive: will it arrive around May?\nAll the teams are currently involved in preparing for the 2025 season and in the development of the related projects, before concentrating ever more resources in view of the important regulatory change of the next calendar year. The development of the wings, especially the front ones, is always intense and that element, together with the floor, is one of the components in which the teams continue to spend key resources in development. The top teams are those that concentrate the most resources in the development of materials and their elasticity, to the full advantage of aerodynamic efficiency. Not least Ferrari, which at the Grand Prix of the Americas (Austin) had introduced a new front wing updated only in the composition of the materials , maintaining the same aerodynamic shape so much so as to appear visually the same specification.\n\nAs AutoRacer has learned , the Federation has already sent a draft of an update to the technical checks regarding the flex of the front wing . A technical directive that would further revise how much the front wing flap will have to flex during static tests, the only truly real tool that the Federation believes it can use to control flex. It is curious that even McLaren, the most talked about team on the subject, agrees and is one of the supporters of this new possible technical directive, since the Woking team has paid a lot of attention to the Ferrari and Mercedes wings in the second part of last season.\n\nFrom the latest draft delivered to the teams, it would emerge that the FIA has further reduced the maximum allowable flex. According to several insiders, it normally takes 3 to even 6 months of development to adapt and be able to reduce the negative effects of a technical directive linked to the carbon structure of the front wings. Something that would obviously hit the small teams the most, which are already oriented to move large resources to 2026 already in the first part of this 2025 while, in doing so, they would have to review their plans by allocating resources to review wings that they had already defined. From what we have learned, if everything goes in the agreed direction, the technical directive could be officially valid from May . A ping-pong that the FIA is still managing also to evaluate whether to extend the update to the checks also to the rear wings."", ""The FIA as usual are unserious. Didn't do shit last year and then decide deep into the off season that they actually want to do something. Must be a headache for the teams to deal with before a regulation change."", 'Seriously Ferrari and RBR waited six months and FIA did nothing. Now they are doing it FIA comes with this and cause lot of wastage of resources.', 'A mid season TD for non safety reasons in a cost cap era is not cool.\xa0', ""Another TD mid season for no reason when this could have been changed for the regs for 2025. Classic FIA, can't wait for this to ruin my team's season again .üëåüëåüëå"", 'I thought when they decided not to change anything for 2025 that it was the most sensible decision. If they wanted they could have decided differently.\n\nBut saying one thing, then change your mind a month later and introduce mid season not-rule changes is just stupid. Even more so in the context of 2026, and this can be a very impactful change.', 'why now?? after multiple times saying they won‚Äôt for ‚Äò25?. they‚Äôre just fucking over the teams especially the smaller ones and probably ferrari and red bull as well', 'All my homies hate the fia', 'Omg just let them flex, it‚Äôs amazing what they can do with carbon fiber and it feels archaic to not let them push this further']",218,47,0.97,218,45,45,39,10,0.0,39
