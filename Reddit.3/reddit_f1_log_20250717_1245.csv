1m1hrtk,Why McLaren wants Piastri to try suspension he's rejected so far,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m1hrtk/why_mclaren_wants_piastri_to_try_suspension_hes/,2025-07-16, News,,"['""The McLaren Formula 1 team is evaluating whether or not Oscar Piastri should start using some of the new suspension components that Lando Norris has adopted.""\n\nTL;DR: Oscar doesn\'t seem interested (he wants to keep the car consistent). It\'s causing McLaren to bring more parts because of the two specifications. Stella says ""it may stay this way through the end of the season."" Lando credits his recent form to hard work off-track.\n\nMy takeaway: It may be annoying to bring more parts to the track but McLaren will keep doing it so that they aren\'t favouring one driver over the other (while hoping Oscar will decide to take the new suspension and save them some aggravation).\n\nI suspect that if Macca weren\'t so committed to ""two #1 drivers"" that there would only be one suspension package.

Oscar is on the original suspension with the extreme anti-dive, ie the front doesn’t drop under braking at all, providing better (more consistent) low-medium speed downforce. Lando’s suspension geometry is less extreme, with the Instant Center (where the upper/lower arm lines meet) somewhat above the Center of Gravity.\n\nStella thinks it’s a pain having separate setups, requiring more spares etc, and he knows that Oscar will be quick on Lando’s setup. Oscar will also know this but won’t want to cede any advantage his setup has - or allow the team to develop towards his rival’s preferences. It’s a good pickle.', 'Ok I know people are going to be polarised by this.\n\nHere is the thing this article was written with the intention of causing that polarization,  sports journalism really just is like that they might have even asked a particular questions just to get this news bite around the different car because the biggest story in regards to McLaren really is \n""Can they treat both drivers equaly if they both have a shot"" \n\nthe team is interested in winning and wouldn\'t ask if they can have an advantage overall, now I am not disconnecting favouritism or anything such that might be happening behind the scene (nor do anyone here have any knowledge of it) \n\nSo it\'s probably better to just take this news as just another piece of interesting information.
