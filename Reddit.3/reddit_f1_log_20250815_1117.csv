1mqsgwp,2025 Formula 1 mid-season driver rankings #12: Gabriel Bortoleto,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mqsgwp/2025_formula_1_midseason_driver_rankings_12/,2025-08-15, News,,"[""12 is pretty high and driven by recency bias. He's only recently started to finish the car in places it should be in. Hulk was doing the heavy lifting for most of the season but that's to be expected as he's an experienced driver and Borto is a rookie. But in pure performance, 12th is really flattering him. If he can drive the next half season like he has for the last few GP then the 12th will be a lot more deserving."", 'Bit high imo and driven by recency bias. He spun out of three races this year by himself which is very poor. I don‚Äôt think Hulkenburg is as great a benchmark as everyone thinks because his team mates in the last few years have been some of the worst drivers on the grid. Last time he had a decent team mate he was soundly beaten in 2019.\xa0\n\nPersonally I can‚Äôt get behind putting him above Hamilton or even Sainz who both have much better team mates. I‚Äôd also rate Antonelli and Stroll above him.', 'Way too high. People are just underrating the Sauber. Hulkenberg is ahead of Alonso in the championship and yet Bortoleto is behind Stroll!', ""After Barcelona, Sauber gave him a better car. He started performing more consistently. Before that, the car was very bad, and the points Hulk got before were purely due to experience, as is normal for a more experienced driver. I think no good driver can show anything with a bad car. Look at Hamilton and Verstappen, how much they're suffering with their cars. Now, imagine a Sauber."", 'A little low imo, but an acceptable ranking for Brotoleto. He‚Äôll only be getting stronger from here!', ""frontrunner bias that he's not higher imo"", ""I've noticed this as well. If you go back to older posts pre-Barcelona, there were a lot of comments about how Bortoleto wasn't doing anything (even if he was keeping up with Hulk). Even some on how he needed to show some ability or he might wash out.\n\nPost-Barcelona and suddenly he's the best rookie. I think it's very informative on how car performance can wildly skew opinion."", ""Say what you want about stroll, but he's not a rookie anymore so that comparison is a bit flawed imo. 12th is fine with me, better than those behind for sure, especially if you see his progress.\xa0"", ""Who would you rate above him? Max/Charles/George/Lando/Oscar/Lewis are obviously better. Albon, Alonso, Ocon and Gasly are also better. Hulk has also had higher highs (podium vs. P6) and while Bortoleto has outqualified him, Sunday is where you get points. Until very recently, Hulk was beating him there.\n\nThat leaves at highest, P12 for him, and he's currently in the fastest midfield car. I'd argue that Bearman has an edge too, since he has a tougher teammate benchmark (Ocon is currently better than Hulk as a driver), plus a weaker car. Hadjar has also been pretty solid. You can make the argument that Sainz's abysmal performance isn't indicative of his level either (but IMO, it's fair to rate him lower taking this season in isolation).\n\nIf anything, P12 is more or less the best you can rate him without going full recency bias."", 'It‚Äôs the opposite. If Sauber hadnt got their upgrade and he‚Äôd still had the same sort of performances vs Hulkenberg‚Äôs but jt was for P15 rather than P6 people would have him much lower.\xa0']",35,17,0.84,35,17,17,10,6,-0.07000000000000006,10
