However i wanted to test how true this actually is so i decided to see the data





For this test i've decided to use the data on driver ranking from the site F1 HOT or NOT.  After each race of the F1 calendar  teams and drivers were rated by fans. Worst ranking on a single weekend possible for a driver is -2.00. Highest ranking on a single weekend possible is +2.00. 





What I've decided to do is compare the rating of each driver between their 2023 and 2024 season and see how they compare  and see if there is correlation between the increase of their rating and increase of their car performance or vice versa. 2023 and 2024 are perfect seasons to compare asthere were no drivers changing teams and everyone remained with the exact same teammate except Tsunoda and Albon, the only thing that changed was car performance

Conclusion: 9 out of 10 teams's drivers rating correlated to car improving and regressing which shows the affect of car performance on the perception of driver rating. The only exception here was the RB team which was a special case along with Williams due to driver change. 8/8 teams's drivers rating that had no driver changes correlated to car's performance","[""Yep, it's very obvious most driver ratings don't put nearly enough weight on the actual car performance. It can get especially bad when a car/team that is perceived as good or bad performs the opposite. Like a car goes from worst to best in the midfield and suddenly people talk about what a great season their drivers are having."", 'Nice work!', 'Basically Haas and Alpine this season lol.', ""RBR,AM and Haas are the most obvious examples. RBR and AM drivers got their rating tanked massively because car regressed a lot while Haas was the opposite. Fans always have perception that big teams are good and small teams are bad even though that isnt always the case. I've seen Alonso getting worse rating than Hulk in 2nd part of the season and even KMag who he both outscored in in that part of the season especially Magnussen by a lot in what was a slower car. People had this\xa0 thing in their head that Haas is a small team so they must be shit and they kept AM as 5th fastest car in their head even though they were only faster than Sauber and Williams once they ran out of parts"", 'Than you!', ""Yep, it's as they think it's morel likely drivers vary by a ton season to season, or even race to race, than cars. Like I get tanking a drivers rating if he makes a bunch of mistakes or does worse vs his teammate but if both get worse or better simultaneously it's likely something else.""]",30,8,0.86,30,34,34,-3,0,-0.040000000000000036,-3
