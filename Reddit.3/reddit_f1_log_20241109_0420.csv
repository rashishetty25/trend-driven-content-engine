Lets Not forget that mercs stake on their Team is only 33%.', '> Formula 1 is booming worldwide. Thanks to cost caps, growing interest from sponsors and increasing income from the sale of rights, the first teams are now operating profitably. Whereas it used to be necessary to invest millions in racing, it will soon be possible to earn real money with Formula 1.\n\n> One consequence of this is that the racing teams are increasing in value. Even small teams such as Haas or Toro Rosso are now valued at over a billion euros. And because this is an illustrious circle of teams that is not so easy to get into from the outside, the trend is even increasing.\n\n> Some racing teams have started to literally capitalize on the development and sell shares. In June 2023, for example, Alpine announced that it had sold 24% of the team to a group of investors including actor Ryan Reynolds, golfer Rory McIlroy, boxer Anthony Joshua and football stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce.\n\n> In mid-September, the British website “Sky” reported that the US investment companies HPS and Accel were planning to invest in the Aston Martin Formula 1 team. Between 20 and 25 percent of the shares are to change hands. The deal is expected to increase the valuation of the racing team to at least 1.8 billion euros.\n\n> And according to information from auto motor und sport, Audi is also on the verge of concluding a deal with an investor. The purchase of the Sauber racing team was only completed at the beginning of the year. However, because the value of the racing team has already risen considerably since the deal was concluded, Audi can now really cash in.\n\n> Rumor has it that a suitable partner has already been found. The Qatar sovereign wealth fund wants to acquire a minority stake in the new works team. The emirate already owns shares in Volkswagen and Porsche. Now the billionaire investor from the Middle East is investing its money in the premier class for the first time.\n\n> The fresh money is likely to be used by Audi to further expand the Hinwil site. Here, the increase in personnel and infrastructure has not yet been completed. The car manufacturer would therefore not have to draw on its own reserves as a result of the Qatar deal.\n\n> Audi itself did not want to confirm the sale of shares in its F1 racing team. When asked by auto motor und sport, the company merely stated: “We are not involved in speculation. The team is not for sale.” However, the sale of a minority share would not be ruled out.\n\n> Even if it is not clear how high the sold share is, Audi will certainly retain control and not allow itself to be talked into decisions. According to our information, the negotiations began some time ago and are not a reaction to the current economic situation.\n\n> Managing Director Gernot Döllner said back in September at the race in Monza that the team’s involvement was not in question and was a long-term decision: “The decision was well prepared two and a half years ago and reassessed last year. We are firmly convinced that Formula 1 and Audi are a perfect match. It is in line with our strategy.”\n\n> The deal with Qatar could also be lucrative for Audi beyond the pure investment. The direct connection naturally opens up numerous opportunities at sponsor level. Qatar Airways is already active as a series partner in Formula 1. It is quite possible that the airline’s logos will soon be seen on the racing cars from Hinwil.\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)', 'Shit', 'Audi is already working on an exit strategy...Killing all VAG Motorsport programmes for this...

The cameras zoom in excessively and are constantly moving. This makes it nearly impossible to distinguish the car from the background. It's really difficult to understand what the car is doing—whether it's sliding or running wide. Sometimes it's even dizzying because all I can see is a fragment of a moving car.

You can better understand what I mean by watching older F1 videos. Here's an example:

How we saw the cars back in 2004: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ-gho8p00o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ-gho8p00o)

Sort of like an inverse Norris.

He didn't put a foot wrong in Hungary 2021 when Vettel was in his DRS for 60+ laps. Later that year in Jeddah, he again made no mistakes while at the front and only lost the podium because he [lost a piece of his floor with 2 laps to go](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/ocon-floor-damage-cost-me-in-saudi-f1-podium-battle-with-bottas/6856759/), before that he was almost matching Bottas' times. In Suzuka 2022, he qualified in the top 5 and finished P4 after defending against Hamilton the whole race. Monaco 2023 was simply a superb qualifying lap followed by a strong performance in the race, where Sainz was heavily pressuring him in the first stint and almost crashed into him. And finally last weekend, where I believe he had a shot at winning if Sainz didn't cause another red flag.

Ocon is simply imo a very clean driver that rarely makes mistakes hence why he sometimes has a nickname of “Oconsistency”.

For some reason Ocon gets too aggressive with his teammates a few times which simply feels self destructive imo. \n\nOcon and Gasly are easily the 5th best lineup on the grid and both are highly credible midfield drivers that can take advantage of chaos and score a podium or even a win when the rare opportunity arises for them both. \n\nIt is a pity for most of the season they haven’t had a better car to showcase their talents, but I’m glad they both capitalized on it beautifully at Brazil.', 'He’s not one of the only ones, but he’s definitely good at it.\n\nNo chance he was going to win though.

I do think though that he’ll learn from this season and if he’s in a championship battle again next year he’ll be much better prepared for it. \n\nHe deserves criticism yes but not the amount he’s getting. It’s gone past the point of criticism and turned into straight up hate from a lot of people. At the end of the day he’s been able to make himself a contender (although an outside shot), that’s something that neither Perez and Piastri have been able to do in the same cars.', '1) He’s not ready yet. It is also a big task to fight a guy like max rn \n\n2) this should a year for him to learn and McLaren as a whole is actively re-learning how to fight in a championship \n\n3) going back to point 1, Max has been in God mode for the past 4 years \n\n4) Norris is very quick but he ain’t a Hamilton/Vettel/Alonso/Max.', 'Personally I felt this article was a good bit too harsh on a driver who hadn’t even won a race going into this season. When we look back beating Max Verstappen during his peak WDC years will look to have been as difficult as it is - almost impossible, even in a second-best car. It’s been a tough end to the chase under intense scrutiny but overall I think Norris can be proud of the season, though I would say he needs to secure P2 and McLaren the WCC in order to be really happy with it.', 'The guy went from being mid-field driver to race winner, to reliable race leader, to pole taker, to championship contender all within half a season basicly. \n\nHe still have a lot to learn yes but lets not forget how fast everything moved for him too. If he would be in the same position next season and still makes the same mistakes and/or says the same things, thats when he should really deserves all of this.', ""I think Perez in 2023 was the worst title contender.\n\n(I'm responding to journo bullshit with more journo bullshit)\n\nHe was declared a title contender in 2023 after his Miami win and then got utterly crushed for the rest of the season and the entirety of 2024 and he's still getting battered with barely making it into Q2 and fighting for 1 or 2 points every race."", ""If you've followed the sport for even just a few years, you know that he's obviously not. His WDC challenge fell off a cliff and he made some mistakes, but he's hardly out there Maldonadoing himself out of races, four top teams are all relatively close in terms of performance (which is double the norm), and he's up against *Max Verstappen*. Lando entered new territory for himself this season, and while it didn't ultimately go the way he wanted it to, I think he'll come back stronger from it if McLaren can continue this momentum into 2025. Of course, he'll have to worry about Piastri then as well since he'll most likely up his game a lot in his third season.""]",0,122,0.29,0,977,977,0,2,0.0,0
