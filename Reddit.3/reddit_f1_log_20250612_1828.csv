And Hamilton does not feel heard**\n\nby Daniele Sparisci and Giorgio Terruzzi\n\n***The bad start to the season is leaving its mark on Ferrari: even Vasseur is at risk. And for the first time Leclerc is in doubt despite a long contract***\n\nTwo podiums in a row, and in Canada the chase for the third on the track named after Gilles Villeneuve begins. The revival yes, but the results are far from the initial objectives: a disappointment that is having profound effects. Several fronts have been opened at Ferrari, Fred Vasseur's actions put under scrutiny by top management, Hamilton's outbursts, and above all the doubts, really present for the first time in Leclerc's head.\n\nThe French boss has been asked to account for the unsatisfactory performance, his position is no longer so firm, he is accused of knowing little about the internal environment, and it is curious that this weekend the trajectory of his Ferrari crosses at a distance that of the other Rossa, driven by the man who could replace him: Antonello Coletta, head of endurance, engaged in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in a World Championship that began with three wins out of three. In the past, the Roman manager had been consulted to lead F1, but had politely declined, and he reiterated this again recently, aware of the enormous difference between the two racing worlds. Now that he has won everything it would be harder to back out. His name (together with that of Horner, an old favourite of Elkann, who was visiting Juve yesterday) is at the top of the list if Vasseur were to part company.\n\nBehind the team principal's case is the disquiet of the drivers, Leclerc meanwhile. From his inner circle someone has let slip questions about the contract that binds him to Maranello until 2029, when he will be 31. A definitive marriage, characterised by continuous declarations of love. But his confidence no longer seems total, he is experiencing cyclical crises and it will not have escaped his notice that Piastri in one year, since McLaren returned to the top, has won almost as much as him in 7 seasons in red.\n\nNothing is set in stone, but the simple fact that he can look around without ruling out a move to another team (there are exit clauses in the agreement) seems related to the opportunities offered by 2026. His fear is to find himself in a struggling Rossa even in the new rule cycle. Mercedes, on the other hand, is credited with a technical advantage thanks to its engine. It has not yet renewed Russell's contract, it has pursued Verstappen but it is likely that Max will stay with Red Bull next year to choose who to settle with in 2027, unless he really decides to take a break, which only he could afford. Charles has also always been held in high esteem by Toto Wolff. Then there is Aston Martin in the midst of a revival with Adrian Newey but it would be a high-risk bet.\n\nFinally Hamilton: his entry has not produced the hoped-for effects, but it has increased the value of Leclerc, who is now not only very fast, but also a beacon on the track after silently putting up with talk of how much he could have learned from Lewis. Who in turn is in crisis. On the one hand he honestly admits his difficulties, on the other he suffers from a complicated relationship. As the GPs go by, there is a feeling that he is not being listened to or followed enough by the team. Which raises a whole series of questions since his signing was supported by reasons that go beyond competitive performance, just think of the enormous return in image that the whole of F1 initially benefited from. Distant memories, it was the Winter World Cup.\n\n12 June 2025"", ""Leclerc's finally getting over his Stockholm Syndrome, love to see it."", ""What a beautifully united and healthy team environment where the higher ups use their influence over Italian media outlets to smear their employees publicly as a pressure campaign.

Keep the Sopranos out of it and focus on the racing, then again easier said than done since Ferrari's greatest creation the last 20 years seems to be drama, gossip and toxicity."", 'How fair is it to be critical of the car as far as performance is concerned? They fought for a constructors last year down to the last race. They’ve been on an upward trajectory with Vasseur since he joined and this is the first big back step. But they felt they had reached the limit of development last year and changed suspension geometry, and in turn basically the whole car. This season was always a bit of an unknown because of that but like last year leaps could still be made.']",1648,240,0.97,1648,216,216,123,6,0.0,123

This red car, completely redesigned from the SF-24, was supposed to offer the aerodynamicists development options that did not materialise. The objectives sought, therefore, have failed miserably. McLaren has a clear advantage: we are talking about almost four tenths per lap, an enormity that will not be made up between now and the end of the year.\n\nThe question to ask, therefore, is another: is this team sufficient to meet the 2026 challenges? Loic Serra is an excellent engineer: he arrived from Mercedes (where he was missed) to take on the role of technical director. A position he had never held and which Vasseur entrusted to him. It is one thing to follow a project and another to manage a technical department. The Frenchman does not have the necessary charisma to drag the team along. After Imola, the top management had asked for an acceleration in the arrival of the novelties: the coup de reniere did not take place, hoping in the meantime that the change in the rules on wing flexibility would play in Maranello's favour: with more rigid profiles there were those who hoped to bring the single-seater papayas closer. An illusion cradled for a long time in the GeS that Barcelona has peremptorily cancelled. This, then, looks like a Ferrari with blunt nails.\n\nIs the problem only of a technical nature or are the causes to be sought deeper down? Is it surprising that Vasseur's contract expires at the end of 2025, closing the three-year cycle, and that for such a strategic role for the future, there has not yet been a renewal discussion, giving stability to the team? It may be that the negotiations are being conducted in absolute silence, but the feeling of several observers is that for Fred a moment of ‘great coldness’ on the part of the ownership has begun, a situation similar to that which accompanied the exit of Mattia Binotto. The team principal is stubbornly chasing a potential from the car that has so far not been seen, while Lewis Hamilton, for example, advises to forget about 2025 in order to devote all energy to next year."", ""Replacing Vasseur isn't going to change anything. They faced issues long before he joined. The problems are much more deeply rooted."", 'This is the most obvious ""leak"", at this point Elkann and Vigna should have just made an interview saying they don\'t want Vasseur anymore. Not only they keep dragging down the team thanks to their ego for decades, now they want to sack the only guy in years that is able to bring back the team at the top and to do it in this way.', 'Incredible how Ferrari behaves like an italian football team', ""Ferrari fires their principal every 3 years and their results don't change."", 'Horner will go to Ferrari.

1l9lxox,[AMuS] The technical secrets of the MCL39,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l9lxox/amus_the_technical_secrets_of_the_mcl39/,2025-06-12, News,,"['It’s still a secret. \nSaved you the time reading the article.', '*What makes Mclaren so superior?*\n\nTranslation:\n\n> **McLaren\'s opponents are slowly beginning to realize that the MCL39 harbors more than just a secret. We\'ve gone in search of clues.**\n\n> The numbers speak for themselves. McLaren has won seven of the nine Grands Prix, three of them doubles. Oscar Piastri has taken pole position four times, Lando Norris twice. Seven of the nine fastest laps were set by one of the two McLaren drivers, who now hold a fairly comfortable one-two lead in the World Championship. Only Max Verstappen still has some visual contact.\n\n> The clearest evidence of the British racing team\'s superiority is the points tally in the overall constructors\' standings. McLaren has already collected 362 points, an average of 40.2. 43 points is the maximum for a weekend without a sprint. If things continue in this vein, McLaren will end up with more points than Ferrari, Mercedes, and Red Bull combined.\n\n> So far, only Max Verstappen has coaxed the new power in Formula 1 out of its shell. This always happens where the corners are fast, the asphalt is smooth, and tire wear is minimal. So far, this has only been the case in Suzuka, Jeddah, and Imola.\n\n> **Dominance difficult to grasp.**\nEverywhere else, the McLarens are practically unbeatable. This isn\'t as noticeable as Verstappen\'s one-man show in 2023, though, because the gaps in qualifying are relatively small. In Q1, the 20 drivers are often separated by just a second. McLaren usually only shows its strength on Sunday. And then only subtly, because Piastri and Norris only do the bare minimum when they\'re in front. If necessary, they can increase the pace from one lap to the next at the push of a button.\n\n> It\'s a kind of dominance that\'s hard to grasp. The competition has a hard time getting to the bottom of the Papaya racers\' secret, because they have no clear strengths or weaknesses. They\'re not outstanding in any one area, but they\'re good everywhere. They handle fast corners just as well as slow ones, gaining no more on the brakes than at the apex or during acceleration. If anything stands out at all, it\'s the poor top speed. But there are reasons for this.\n\n> The most striking feature is how the McLarens manage their tires. They are the only cars that use the softest compound tire for the entire qualifying lap. The others have to decide whether to push hard in the first sector and lose grip in the last, or to hold back at the beginning of the lap to keep the tires within the temperature window until the final sector. Verstappen opted for the latter in Barcelona. He lost 0.195 seconds to Piastri in the first sector, 0.124 seconds in the second, but only gained 0.027 seconds by the end of the lap.\n\n> **Tire puzzle still not solved.**\nThis behavior is even more blatant in the race. The competition loses grip after a few laps because the tires overheat. At McLaren, the temperature remains stable. And this isn\'t just because the McLaren drivers at the front mostly drive in clean air. The car harbors many little secrets that are difficult to decipher. The flexible wings, front and rear, were not one of them. McLaren survived both testing intensifications unscathed. Max Verstappen commented almost resignedly: ""A good car is still a good car.""\n\n> Since summer 2023, McLaren has been building a car that has been optimized from nose to rear wing over a development cycle that includes six major upgrades and numerous detailed changes. Engineers Rob Marshall and Peter Prodromou have found the precise level of downforce at which downforce is just barely stable. Unlike its rivals, McLaren has expanded the window of ride heights at which the MCL39 delivers predictable downforce – for both slow and fast corners.\n\n> The front wing, the geometry of the front axle, its wishbones, and the Venturi ducts at the front are a combination that places the center of downforce centrally, precisely where the driver sits and the car touches down. This is why the McLaren has its own cooling circuit for the cockpit. Special fluid circulates through a system of cooling ducts. The underbody edges, sidepods, and rear brake vents are designed to create air vortices that effectively seal the gap between the diffuser and the rear wheels.\n\n> **Why do the rear wheels stay off?**\nThe cooling of the entire vehicle has been improved, eliminating the need for airflow-restricting exhaust gills in the fairing. The entire car radiates less heat, which also benefits the tires. The air duct between the two brake drums is designed to shield the brake heat from a certain point against the inner wall of the rim.\n\n> It\'s unknown whether low-phase-change metals are used as heat shields. McLaren hasn\'t commented on the matter. McLaren accepts that the high cost of cooling all the car\'s components results in increased drag. Those driving at the front can forgo top speed.\n\n> Also unexplained is why McLaren always pushes the limits in the essentially meaningless third practice session, shocking their opponents with fabulous times. Or why the mechanics line up in front of the car to shield them from view while they work on the brake vents. Or why the cars on the starting grid are the only ones lined up bare at the rear. The rear wheels are always fitted at the last minute. The competition still has a few mysteries to solve.', 'So is the article just: ""there are secrets that teams are still puzzled by""?\n\nYeah bro we knew, could you be more precise tho', ""What I'm more curious about is why their engine is unlike that of Merc or Aston?"", 'How much do you think the recently hired Redbull staff Rob Marshall had input in the current MCL-39? Was his input a key to their success?', ""I think these regulations more than previous ones reward superior knowledge of how the car functions as opposed to raw performance numbers. It's a big part of why Mercedes came unstuck because they chased numbers and looked for silver bullets when the numbers didn't equate to performance on track.\n\nIn the previous regs you could very much brute force more downforce and better drag efficiency and make your car faster, which when combined with unlimited resources and the most powerful engine made it very easy for Mercedes to waltz to championships every year. Now you can make the numbers better but it means nothing when the car is sensitive and can't use it most of the time and then you don't have the resources to really go into depth into finding out why.\n\nI think it's clear McLaren have a deeper understanding of operating windows, tyre behaviour and how the car behaves in general in a very natural and innate way and that isn't going to change this year, but fortunately for the rest of the grid, it probably wont be so important next year."", ""The most depressing thing for non McLaren or neutral fans is that even if teams know what and how McLaren is doing what they are doing, it probably would require some fundamental changes that can't be done mid season. Meaning that even if teams wanted to keep developing 2025 cars in order to try and get the title (Red Bull) there is just not enough performance to be found."", 'Must be the water (in the veins)', '🔑 Key Reasons Behind McLaren’s Superiority:\n\nNo Major Weaknesses: The car is well-balanced across all track types—fast or slow corners, braking, and acceleration.\n\nTire Management: McLaren uniquely keeps tire temperatures stable, allowing them to fully push for an entire lap in qualifying and remain consistent in races.\n\nDownforce Precision: Their aero setup delivers predictable grip at various ride heights. Key innovations in the front suspension, Venturi tunnels, and rear airflow help maintain balance and cooling.\n\nAdvanced Cooling: A dedicated cooling system even for the cockpit and brakes prevents heat buildup, helping tire longevity.\n\nTrade-off Acceptance: McLaren sacrifices some top speed for better cooling and drag stability—an advantage when leading in clean air.\n\nMystery Factors: Their behavior in FP3, secrecy around brake vents, and last-minute rear wheel fittings suggest deeper technical tricks the competition hasn’t figured out.\n\n\nIn short, McLaren doesn’t dominate with raw speed alone but with an all-round, finely-tuned package that excels especially under race conditions—making them quietly unbeatable.']",19,24,0.68,19,21,21,-3,1,-0.029999999999999916,-3
