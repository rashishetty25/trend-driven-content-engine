1jw1g8g,"Is it the consensus opinion that Hamilton was better/more talented than Alonso, at their peak?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jw1g8g/is_it_the_consensus_opinion_that_hamilton_was/,2025-04-10, Discussion,"I know people hastily point to 2007 as definite proof of Hamilton being better, even though I'd argue 2007 was Alonso's worst season. Had to adapt to new tyres, didn't like the brakes of the car, and let Ron's management and his own paranoia to reach his head.

Still, after Mclaren finally changed his breaks at Silverstone, he outqualified and outpointed Hamilton for the rest of the season. Still, it was a mighty fight and Hamilton remains the most impressive rookie season of all time.

But then from 2008 to 2014, I think it's arguable that Alonso was the better driver in most seasons. 

In 2008, Hamilton was weirdly doing mistakes he wasn't doing in his rookie season. Both him and Massa seemed to have been trying to gift the championship to eachother. I can't help but feel Alonso would have cruised to an easy championship if he stayed at Mclaren, he was incredibly consistent in 2008, but the Renault was an average car.

In 2009 they both drove well, better than Button or Vettel who were doing lots of mistakes. It's hard to tell.

In 2010 again both drove well, probably better than Vettel. Maybe Lewis takes it because I feel Alonso has more notorious mistakes like Spa.

In 2011 Alonso was definetely better. Hamilton had probably his worst year in F1.

In 2012 I can't really say Hamilton drove bad, he was really good when Mclaren weren't fucking him up, but Alonso also had his best season ever, next to 2006. Ferrari were more or less the 4th fastest car, though reliability probably take them above Mclaren as the 3rd best car of the season.

In 2013 again I think Alonso was better. Maybe some of you have different opinions. Hamilton was still accomodating at a new team.

After 2014 it's impossible to tell, mostly because Lewis would go on to enjoy probably the best run of cars in F1 ever, with a championship capable car every season, and 4 dominant cars, while Alonso will experience some of the worst, at least in the modern era, with the 2015-2017 Mclaren Hondas.

Still, for what it is worth, Alonso had a bigger %avg race page gap between him and Button than what Lewis did. His gap to Massa is also big enough to accomodate for the gap between Hamilton and Bottas and the gap between Bottas and Massa, for some cross comparison.

Both are actually consistent with the average %gap between Alonso and Hamilton in 2007. Hamilton enjoyed a -0.05% advantage in quali, while Alonso enjoyed a -0.05% in race pace. So they were both within half a tenth of eachother, just with different strenghts.

What's your opinion? For me these 2 guys are the 3rd and 4th best drivers of all time, though I switch them up depending on how I wake up on the day. One thing is clear, I think Alonso might have the biggest gap between his talent and level of achievements, maybe other than G. Villeneuve.","[""It's F1 rarely is anyone competing on the same field. The field being the car.\n\nMy position is that you're only as good as your competition."", ""They're both great"", 'In the f1 community, is there ever a consensus on anything?', 'Very close between them, but if I had to pick one at their peak it would be Alonso. I know they tied while Hamilton was a rookie, but looking at the rest of their careers (comparison with Button, Kovalainen-Fisichella link, Bottas-Massa link) suggests to me Alonso simply underperformed his usual level in 2007 and I would expect him to have a slight advantage in normal circumstances. Also, as someone who likes reading about models of driver performance, every model I’ve looked at rates Alonso slightly ahead.\n\nI think Alonso’s main advantage over Hamilton is his relentlessness. Even during his prime years, Hamilton always had a handful of off-weekends per season where he would just be outpaced by Bottas on merit, whereas that sort of thing didn’t really happen to Alonso, or at least not as often.', ""There's no consensus, but for me Alonso was the better driver in his peak, and you've listed some of the reasons why which I agree with.
