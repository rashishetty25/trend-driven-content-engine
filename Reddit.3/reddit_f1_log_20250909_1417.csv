1nbryi7,Mclaren Pit Stop Drama. Lets explore the probable scenarios.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nbryi7/mclaren_pit_stop_drama_lets_explore_the_probable/,2025-09-08, Discussion,"Scenario 1) Lando pits first, Oscar pits second, both pit stops go as expected.  
Probable Result: Lando P2, Oscar P3. Oscar does an extra lap, Lando gets a 1 lap undercut on Piastri. Oscar \~4 seconds behind Lando after the stops.

Scenario 2) Lando pits first, Oscar pits second, Oscar gets the slow stop. Was it an operator issue, or was it a gun issue. If a gun issue then stop 2 would've been slower i.e. Oscar's stop.  
Probable result: Lando P2, Oscar P4 behind Leclerc and Lando after the stops or \~8 seconds behind Lando (would've been close).

Scenario 3) Oscar pits first, Lando pits second, both pit stops go as expected.  
Probable Result: Lando P2, Oscar P3. Lando does an extra lap, Oscar gets a 1 lap undercut on Lando. Oscar \~3 seconds behind Lando after the stops.

Secnario 4) Oscar pits first, Lando pits second, Lando gets the slow stop.  
Actual result: Oscar P2, Lando P3. Team asks Oscar to let Lando by and they are free to race.  
Oscar is < 1 second behind Lando after letting him by.

In terms of fighting for P2, Oscar was still given an advantage over Lando than all other scenarios with what Mclaren did by asking them to swap.

Lando and Oscar did the right thing by the team. Which consists of hundreds of people at the fatcory not just themselves. Including the poor wheel gunner who either had bad equipment or a bad day at the office, we don't know.

Oscar ended up closer to Lando in this scenario than any other. And it is possible that Oscar would've finished behind Leclerc if the stops were the other way around.

I think given the awkward position they were all in, it actually was fair for Oscar to give up the position.","['A car undercuts the one in front. Lando cannot undercut Oscar in this situation, he would simply be pitting first.', 'You missed scenario 5.\n\nLando pits first but gets the slow stop.\n\nLikelihood is Oscar in front by around a second and they have to fight for position.', ""I'm legit baffled on why people are so sure Leclerc wouldve passed Piastri. \n\nFerrari just didnt have the pace and also Leclerc wasn't gaining more than 1-2 tenths per lap on Piastri after his pit stop.
