The sub is generally quite helpful but has a rule that any reselling of tickets at excessive prices will be removed.  And the mod, the single mod is always posting referral links (which he gets money for) to P1 Travel. The issue is the prices P1 Travel askes.  Lets take Suzuka which is on sale now:

B1 stand, officially 63,000yen turns into 132,000yen on P1... More than double. Then looking at the C stand + hotel package. It comes to 852.90 Euro going by the Japanese prices for everything you get, but the price is **€2,084** on P1 Travel**.**  More than a 2x price increase certainly seems excessive and into scalper territory for me. 

The biggest issue I have with this is sometimes I see people recommending to buy tickets from that site over official sales sites.  Pay double.. why? 

Before paying anything to any site, check official pricing first and ask yourself if you want to pay such a markup. And on seeing links anywhere on social media, check if they are paid links and then ask if the info you are getting is unbiased. ","['Thanks for bringing up this issue.

They were stating that P1 Travel is a ""*community verified ticket vendor*"" of GrandPrixTravel and their subreddit was full of what appeared to be affiliate links for P1 Travel.^(The links were via the domain of an affiliate marketing platform and P1 Travel offers an affiliate program.) We found these links in the following places on /r/GrandPrixTravel:\n\n* In the sidebar\n* At the top of their wiki page for official circuit websites\n* At the top of their monthly buy/sell threads\n* In standalone mod-made posts\n* In AutoModerator comments triggered by certain keywords\n\nSome of these links were paired with messages pointing out that some other ticket websites are not fully reliable. In addition we also noticed heavy promotion of FanAmp, an app.\n\nWhen we became aware of all of this in February **we stopped the r/formula1 AutoModerator from redirecting users with ticket & travel related questions to r/GrandPrixTravel and removed links to that subreddit from our sidebar.**\n\nWhile GrandPrixTravel can be a useful resource we considered that it would not be appropriate to continue recommending it given these issues, especially since [Reddit\'s Moderator Code of Conduct](https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct) clearly prohibits *""moderation actions (including actions taken using mod tools, bots, and other services) in exchange for any form of compensation, consideration, gift, or favor from or on behalf of third parties""*', 'I made it to my personal mission to downvote that stupid mod every time I see it and the “hi here is X from P1travel” comments (this seemed to have stopped showing up)\n\nI will always recommend that people buy from the race tracks and only from the race tracks maybe F1 if they are desperate but the resellers are a no go imo…', 'Yeah I got my monza tickets there and felt they were not very up front with what the hospitality inclusion really was.', 'Upvoting for visibility', 'Suzuka went on sale 5 days ago, and was sold out almost immediately via their official website, MobilityCenter.

The reality? Bigger batteries, more weight, and slower cars.\n\n# Heavier cars, slower racing (just like the SUVs nowadays, a modern BMW SUV is over 2 tonnes...)\n\nTripling the electrical power means you need more energy storage. More storage = heavier batteries.  \nThe FIA says the cars will be “lighter overall,” but that’s mostly wishful thinking. Energy recovery will play a much bigger role, so drivers will be juggling deployment and regen instead of just driving flat out.\n\n**If people want to watch battery management and energy strategy, there’s already Formula E for that.**\n\n# The CO₂ comparison is kind of a joke...\n\nHere’s the thing: an F1 car over an entire race weekend burns roughly **220–250 kg of fuel**, or about **300 liters**.  \nThat’s roughly **700 kg of CO₂** for the whole weekend.\n\nNow compare that to Max Verstappen’s private jet — a Dassault Falcon 8X.  \nOne flight from Europe to Austin for the US GP burns around **12,000 kg of jet fuel** (about **15,000 liters**).  \nThat’s around **36 tons of CO₂** — about **50 times more** than his race car produces in a weekend.\n\n**And that’s one flight. Add up all the private jets, freight planes, and trucks that move the paddock around, and it’s obvious where the real emissions come from. The race fuel itself is barely a rounding error.**\n\n# The “green fuel” part isn’t what it sounds like\n\nSynthetic e-fuels can technically be carbon-neutral, but they take an insane amount of energy to make, and they still release CO₂ when burned.  \nThe only thing that makes them “green” is if the production process uses renewable energy and captured carbon — which is nice in theory but doesn’t make the cars any cleaner in practice.\n\n# So what’s the point?\n\n**The 2026 regs make the cars more complicated, more expensive, and likely slower — all for a “green” headline.**  \n**It doesn’t fix the real environmental footprint of F1, which comes from freight and travel, not what’s burned in the cars.**\n\n  \nAnd more boring races...', ""Why did they strike out Max's eyes?"", 'My thinking as well.

Time to lico for 50 laps."", '****\n**Hamilton confident Ferrari can take ‘step forward’ in Austin as he sets out expectation for final races of 2025**\n\nLewis Hamilton has set out his hopes for what Ferrari can achieve at the United States Grand Prix, a race in which team mate Charles Leclerc took victory in 2024.\n\nLewis Hamilton is hopeful that Ferrari can take a “step forward” by extracting more from their car during the United States Grand Prix weekend, with the seven-time World Champion admitting that the final six races of the campaign could play a key role in preparations for 2026.\n\nHamilton arrives into Round 19 of the season off the back of a P8 finish last time out in Singapore, having originally crossed the line in seventh before being handed a five-second time penalty post-race for exceeding track limits whilst managing a brake issue on his car.\n\nLooking ahead to what might be possible at the Circuit of The Americas – a track where he has previously been victorious on five occasions – Hamilton voiced an optimistic note about Ferrari’s prospects in terms of continuing to make improvements to the SF-25.\n\n“I never have expectations except for that we give it our all and we continue to improve,” the Briton said. “I think there are lots and lots of positives to take from every weekend, and there are lots of areas we can improve.\n\n“We spent time after the last race going through areas that we can improve on, and I really think that this weekend we can take a step forward and extract more from the car that we have.\n\n“We’ve not moved the car forward in terms of performance, but there is more performance in the car that, if we execute a little bit better, I think we can extract more, so that’s the goal.”\n\nWith the 2025 season now entering into its last six rounds – featuring three Sprints along the way, including this weekend at COTA – Hamilton was quizzed on what the approach will be and how the squad will find the answers they are seeking ahead of 2026, a year in which new technical regulations will be introduced into the sport.\n\n“These are ultimately test weekends, really, in terms of just continuing to learn, to improve on our processes,” he explained. “In the last races there have been a couple of gems through the weekend that we couldn’t capitalise on, and so it’s taking those good bits from there and continuing to work on them, to take what works and then change what isn’t [working].\n\n“So that’s what we’re trying to do moving forwards. I think it’s continuing to build on the relationships, continuing to build on communication.\n\n“Ultimately, everyone back at the factory really deserves a good result and that’s the sole focus – to get good results, try to maximise, squeeze every point we can out of our performances on the weekends, and I really, really believe that we can do that, so we just stay focused.”\n****', 'I know the prancing horse on that car just wants to gallop right off it out of shame.', 'Meanwhile Russell has two wins and a shipload of podiums.', 'Everyone has long shifted focus to 2026.

1o8jsg0,Do you think Automotodrom Grobnik would be a good F1 track for a Croatian GP?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o8jsg0/do_you_think_automotodrom_grobnik_would_be_a_good/,2025-10-16, Discussion,"Automotodrom Grobnik was once considered for F1, F1 governing body wanted to host races and have a Croatian GP, but the owner was greedy, first demanding more money, then demanding more percentage of the revenue so F1 gave up on trying. 

The track hosted Yugoslavian MotoGP from 1978 to 1990, more recently it was used by Formula 3, hosted NASCAR races from 2019 to 2022 and it still holds Motorcycle races for Alpe Adria International Motorcycle Championship.

It has full facilities, a wide enough pit lane, is really close to a highway and an airport and is regularly maintained. 

Lap record is 1:16.388 by an Austrian formula driver Josef Neuhauser who set the record in 2000 in a Minardi M190 Formula 1 car during the 2000 Rijeka interserie round.

What definitely needs to change for it to be fully viable are runoff areas and barriers, but since F1 already tried to invest into the track and wanted to use it for a Croatian GP I have no doubt that would be sorted if a deal was made.

Unfortunately, I think we'll never see a Croatian GP, but I want to see what you guys think about the track that is 10 minutes by car from my home.","['It looks like a very fun circuit to drive, but unfortunately I think it would offer few overtaking chances.', ""not gonna lie, it looks leagues better than the new Street circuits that keep getting added to the calendar.

1o8wcgy,[OC] How media perception differs from on-track reality for McLaren’s drivers for the 2025 season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o8wcgy/oc_how_media_perception_differs_from_ontrack/,2025-10-17, Discussion,"This visual compares the average media ratings (representing perceived driver performance) with the actual race results for McLaren’s drivers, Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, across the 2025 season so far.
