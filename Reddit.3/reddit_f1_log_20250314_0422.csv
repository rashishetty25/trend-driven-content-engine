Liam Lawson - 2023
Only tow choices and neither are full seasons, 2023 was so impressive when he came in, particularly Singapore. 2024 USA was just as good, but he wasn't beating Yuki as often in 24 so 23 it is. 

Lando Norris - 2021
Ok so Lando is an odd one in that all his seasons I'd rank pretty similar and he's never had a bad year. I chose 21 because of how impressive he was in the first half of the year (at summer break I think he was 3rd in standings) He also could have won a few races post summer break had things home differently. 

Oscar Piastri - 2024 
His run from Austria to Baku was truly incredible and his end of the season was nowhere near as bad as lots of people on here seem to think. He also had bad luck in a few races but still ranked fourth. 

Charles Leclerc - 2024 
This was actually a pretty clear winner. He did not make any of the mistakes that had blighted his previously great seasons and without the bad Ferrari summer run he could have won the championship. Winning in Monaco and Monza is amazing. 

Lewis Hamilton - 2020
His stretch from 18-20 is great but he never seemed quite as unstoppable as he did in 2020. He also beat Bottas better than in 2018 when Bottas had so much bad luck, and 2019 where both of them were on it. 

George Russell - 2024
So 2021 and 2022 are both strong contenders but his drives in Spa and Las Vegas as well as his qualifying demolition of the man with the most poles in F1 puts this first.

Andrea Kimi Antonelli - N/A

Fernando Alonso - 2012 
Fighting for the championship all the way to the end in what was usually the fourth best car is incredible and he deserved that title so much. 

Lance Stroll - 2020 
So Stroll was good in 17 but 2020 was different. He was fourth in the championship at mid season before he had a poor run until his finest hour when her got pole in Istanbul. He also got two podiums. 

Pierre Gasly - 2021 
How did he constantly qualify in the top six week in week out? He battered Yuki and git a podium in Baku as well as really strong P4s in Netherlands and Mexico 

Jack Doohan - 2024 (doesn't really count though) 

Esteban Ocon - 2017 
So Ocon actually had a few contenders, with 22 and 23 (which he got a fair bit of bad luck in) being strong. However 2017 takes it as he was really good in his first full season in F1 and looked like a driver who could challenge for a title in the future. He also could have got a podium in Canada of not for Perez.

Ollie Bearman - 2024 
Only did three races, and two of them were very good, Baku and Saudi. Though I don't rate Saudi quite as highly as most do. 

Yuki Tsunoda - 2024 
After an inconsistent 21 and a poor 22 he improved a lot in 23 before really coming on strong in 2024, topping the midfield numerous times at the start of the year and getting consistent points to the end.

Isack Hadjar - N/A 

Alex Albon - 2023 
Getting great points out of that car and destroying his team mate. His P7's were great as well as qualifying fourth in Zandvoort 

Carlos Sainz. Jr - 2019 
IMO he was easily a top three driver  that year with his constant best to the rest finishes earning him a thoroughly deserved sixth place in the standings spot following his podium in Brazil which is the second best midfield performance I have seen these last five years 

Nico Hulkenburg - 2014
So Hulkenberg is really difficult because loads of his seasons are solid but not spectacular. 2013 was great and I was really tempted to put 2018 here because he was best of the rest that year. But his mistakes in Baku and Spa held me back  and ultimately I think 2014 is his best. 
He finished in the top six in all but one of the first seven races in a force India and at one point he wa third in the championship standings. Only Hulkenburg could be third in the standings without a podium..

Gabriel Bortoleto - N/A
","[""In my opinion, Hamilton's best seasons are 2018, 2014 and 2015 in no particular order.\n\nI also think Leclerc's 2022 year is becoming a little bit underrated in hindsight. He had more pace than in 2024 IMO."", 'I think 2008 and 2018 is better for Lewis Hamilton', ""Good list, IMO Hamilton best season was 2018 (clearly the best driver that season despite not having the clear best car, unlike 2020), Ocon's best was 2021 (won a race, had worse luck than Alonso but was close to him in points despite that), Nico's was probably 2013 (51-6).\n\nAlso, for some drivers multiple seasons can apply (Max, Lando, Carlos, could even argue about Gasly with 2020) but the seasons in the list are probably the best ones IMO (or at least tied for that)."", 'Call me crazy but I thought Fernando was pretty good when he beat Schumacher to two world titles..', 'Aside from 2006 and 2012, I wanna add 2014 for Alonso. Dragging the sixth(?) best car of the grid within a couple laps of a race win in Hungary and nearly getting fifth in the championship is absurd.', ""Hamilton has had so many great seasons. It is hard to pick just one. I think 2018 will be the one for me. \n\nFor Max, I actually pick 2021 over 2023. He didn't have a completely dominant car and had to fight all season to beat Hamilton and Mercedes. All while dealing with the pressure of getting that first championship."", ""Gotta disagree with Hamilton's best being 2020. People love to romanticise that year for Lewis because it was his 7th title, but actually he wasn't really at his best, and imo is the first year where he comes out of his peak/prime. He made quite a few extra uncharacteristic errors that year\n\nHis prime was probably about 2017 - 19, but you can arguably stretch that back to 2015. \n\nI'd give his best season to 2018. I'd love to say 19, but Bottas was at his best that year, and as such it's hard to judge how much of it was Bottas reaching a high level and how much of it was maybe Lewis struggling a bit more"", 'What is with the love for Lewis‚Äô 2008? It‚Äôs one of his weakest seasons. For everyone saying ‚Äòit was only his second season‚Äô it would obviously be a great year by ordinary second season standards, but that glosses over his rookie year literally being better.\n\nAs great as he was at times - and he did hit some staggeringly high heights at races like Monaco, Silverstone and Hockenheim - we have to consider he got himself a grid penalty in Malaysia, the Alonso incident in Bahrain was really his fault for misjudging the closing speed, he had a lucky escape en route to winning Monaco, suffered complete brain fade in Canada and completely messed up the start in Japan. Aside from 2011, this is as patchy as a Lewis season gets. He ended up winning the title because it was arguably the weakest season of the last 20 years from a driving calibre perspective.', 'I might have to go with 2024 for Sainz just for the 2 wins alone. He had a bad weekend at Interlagos, but in general was driving at a very high level across the season. \n\nI‚Äôd go 2022 for Ocon. He had some great drives, played Alonso pretty close, and lost some points from reliability.']",33,139,0.69,33,131,131,-2,4,-0.010000000000000009,-2

To make this perfectly clear: This is going to be highly speculative, especially the further down you go.\n\n**Liam Lawson**\n\nLawson will be going into his first full season with 2 quarter seasons under his belt. That makes it a bit blurry to predict how exactly he will develop, but it also provides a clear baseline not present for most rookies. Based on his performances against Yuki Tsunoda, and assuming his current experience accumulates to that of one full rookie season, his ceiling for 2025 would be \\~71. While he hasn\'t shown any signs of being mistake prone, making the step to a top car can be a bit much sometimes (especially next to someone like Verstappen), resulting in a relative step back. Based on similar examples a rating in the low to mid 60s would then make sense, so I\'ll go with 63.\n\n**Franco Colapinto**\n\nWhile he isn\'t technically on the grid right away, it seems like everyone\'s already expecting him to swoop in for Doohan at some point; and sooner rater than later. Colapinto looked really promising next to Albon and could have a ceiling of around 78 for 2025. He also seemed to be prone to overdriving, making it likely that he wouldn\'t score particularly close to his ceiing. Mid to high 60s might be reasonable. With a bit of improvement concerning his consistency I could see him at 68.\n\n**Oliver Bearman**\n\nBearman\'s junior career isn\'t very telling but his 3 race weekends in 2024 are a bit of an easy out. While it\'s definetly not enough to predict anything concrete, he looks to be situated somewhere between Gasly and Russell in terms of his ceiling. Carlos Sainz might be an appropriate comparison. Sainz\' rookie season is rated 62 by the model. Considering that Bearman will be a year younger than Sainz at the time but has a minimal leg up experience wise, I\'m landing just below 60, so that\'ll be 59 with a low 60s ceiling for 2025.\n\n**Jack Doohan**\n\nHe might not take part in enough races for a rating. Hopefully, his Abu Dhabi result wasn\'t entirely representative but if it was, he has no chance of holding on to that seat. His F2 and F3 record deosn\'t properly aleviate this fear either but at least it suggests that he migtht just not be quite that bad. Far below 50 is still the most likely outcome in my opinion. He\'ll likely settle somewhere ahead of Hartley (25) but worse than Zhou (42).\n\n**Kimi Antonelli**\n\nKimi is heralded as the next Max Verstappen and his F2 season against the slightly older and more experienced Ollie Bearman does at least not refute that notion. Even though his record isn\'t quite as intimidating as Verstappen\'s, if he is that good, Max Verstappen\'s and Charles Leclerc\'s rookie seasons would be the best leads we have to speculate on how good Antonelli will be. Verstappen\'s 2015 was 73 (78), and Leclerc\'s 2018 was 76 (81). Antonelli is a year older than Verstappen was and 2 years younger than Leclerc. If Antonelli is that guy, he\'ll likely score in the mid 70s. I\'m going with 74 (80). If this is true, he\'ll be pretty much matching and then overtaking George on pace from 2026 on.\n\n**Gabriel Bortoleto**\n\nAlthough there are no direct reference points for Bortoleto, his path and age are somewhat reminiscent (if slightly less impressive) of George Russell. Russell\'s rookie season is rated at 66. Their situations are probably going to be relatively similar as well, driving the worst car in Formula 1, so a similar performance relative to their ceilings is not too unlikely. Low to mid 60s might be where Bortoleto will be rated in 2025.\n\n**Isack Hadjar**\n\nHadjar seems like a pretty typical lower midlevel F1 rookie, somewhere in the realm between Zhou and Logan Sargeant which would leave him around 50. Hadjar is a bit younger, meaning you would expect him below 50. It is also possible, since parallels have been drawn, that he will end up following his new teammate who had a very poor first year in F1 (46) due to overdriving and inconsistency. I\'ll go with \\~47.\n\n# Final Order\n\nVerstappen 92 (93)\n\nLeclerc 90 (92)\n\nNorris 87 (89)\n\nRussell 84 (85)\n\nHamilton 82 (84)\n\nSainz 81 (83)\n\nAlbon 80 (83)\n\nPiastri 79 (84)\n\nAlonso 79 (81)\n\nOcon 77 (81)\n\nGasly 76 (80)\n\n**Antonelli 74 (80)**\n\nTsunoda 74 (78)\n\n**Colapinto 68 (78)**\n\n**Lawson 63 (71)**\n\nHulkenberg 63 (68)\n\n**Bortoleto 62 (65)**\n\nStroll 62 (74)\n\n**Bearman 59 (63)**\n\n**Hadjar 47 (51)**\n\n**Doohan 30 (40)**\n\nHistorically, around 65 would be the middle of the pack, but the current grid is absolutely stacked, meaning that some drivers who would actually be considered pretty good might at the same time be below average.

# Let's Speculate
