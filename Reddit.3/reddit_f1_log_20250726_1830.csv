Said it was the first time it had ever happened in his career', 'Went from handing in manuscripts about where Ferrari needs to improve to win championships...to this within the space of a day.\n\nJust Ferrari things.', 'It was an odd mishap. Even at first view, the spin and loss of the rear was FAR earlier than usual for an F1 car. When I saw it, my immediate thought was ""the car broke"" because it seemed like it spun while mostly on straight line braking. If the car spun as it tried to turn into the apex or coming out of the apex, that would be a typical ""too aggressive"" driver move but this really didn\'t seem like it.', 'A key trend in F1 at the moment is for fairly extreme anti-squat and anti-dive geometry to keep the car ""flat"" under acceleration and braking and preserve a consistent ride height for optimal aero.\n\nAll of that theoretically makes the car faster, but it reduces the ""feel"" for the driver. As an accomplished sim racer, Verstappen is probably well placed to exploit this and drive fast without being able to feel the car as well - might explain why RedBull cannot seem to find a team mate able to consistently exploit the car\'s capabilities. Verstappen isn\'t a magician,  there is simply a performance ceiling where the car couldn\'t lap any faster that he can get close to. Piastri\'s McLaren has more front anti-dive than Norris is comfortable with and is therefore theoretically faster IF he can exploit it.\n\nEvery change to the suspension that impacts squat/dive is going to slightly change the optimal brake bias and how the downforce level changes under acceleration and braking. Lewis just found where the limit is. If you never come off the track, you aren\'t trying hard enough to go fast.\n\nOn a fast track like Spa, consistent ride height and the ability to deliver more consistent ground effect downforce is going to allow less top-down aero and a higher top speed. Ferrari haven\'t done the drivers any favours timing the new package for a sprint weekend on a high speed / hairy circuit like Spa - it has the most potential to make a difference here, but the drivers need to learn how the car now behaves.', 'Here we go‚Ä¶\n\nWhy can‚Äôt we just take anything at face value anymore.

SVT Sport: ‚ÄúThe duel continues ‚Äî F1 driver Ollie Bearman‚Äôs Varberg kart track record didn‚Äôt last a full week before Elton Zewenwacht, 23, reclaimed it.‚Äù  Ôøº

The story follows up on Bearman‚Äôs previously celebrated kart lap record in Varberg, where he clocked 28.97 seconds after several days of dedicated practice and technical fine-tuning‚Äîlighter clothing, chassis tweaks, fuel adjustments, setting tire pressure lap-by-lap, and even using a leaf blower to cool the engine  Ôøº.

-But a New Champion Emerges

Barely one week afterward, Elton Zewenwacht took the wheel. Unlike Bearman‚Äôs multi-day effort, Zewenwacht needed only a few laps to adapt‚Äîand then he broke the record. His new best: 28.95 seconds‚Äîtwo hundredths faster  Ôøº.

Zewenwacht, who previously had no competitive experience beyond rental karting, used the same kart‚Äîinitially even with the same worn tires‚Äîand gradually improved. He slipped to 28.99 seconds before switching to fresh tires. By the third or fourth lap, he hit 28.95  Ôøº.

Despite outperforming an active Formula 1 driver, he kept things respectful:

Basically what it says on the tin. The team would not give Yuki the latest parts, preferring to hold them in reserve in case Max needed them.

So what was already a car that was largely shaped my Max‚Äôs preferences, was even tougher to drive for Yuki as he did not get the improved version of the car but was always behind in terms of development. No wonder RBR second drivers have been struggling for such a long time. Who knows how long has this been going on? Being the second driver at Red Bull is really the worst drive on the grid, isn‚Äôt it?

1m9tspb,Suggestion for Changes to the Points System,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m9tspb/suggestion_for_changes_to_the_points_system/,2025-07-26, Discussion,"Hey everyone,

I'm a long time F1 fan, have been watching the sport as my main interest since the 1996 season. Before this, I watched the odd race when my dad had it on, but I was just too young to appreciate it.

We've gone through a number of format revisions and points systems in my time watching the sport and, whilst I thought the 10-6-4-3-2-1 system that ran from 1991 to 2002 worked well in making points feel like a big deal, being so few points paying positions, it also meant that most drivers were racing for no reward most weekends.

  
The 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 system that came in at the start of 2003 was an attempt to stop one dominant driver running away with the championship and winning it extra early, which is what happened the previous season when Michael Schumacher picked up his fifth world title with still a third of the season left to go. It also added two more points paying positions at the same not increasing the points for winning the race. Personally I did not like this system, for me winning a race should have more weight in terms of the championship. The difference between 1st and 2nd in this system in my opinion was too small, a 2nd and a 6th should not be worth more than a 1st, although it did achieve it's primary purpose of keeping championships close.

The biggest change to points scoring since, at least the 1991 season in which finally all race results counted towards the championship, came in 2010, to what we have now. This took in to consideration modern day F1 reliability and a larger grid (3 new teams came for the 2010 season), whilst increasing the gap between 1st and 2nd place again. Whilst I like that there are more points paying positions than any other system we have ever had, I still don't think this is enough. Consider that we have a clear top 4 teams at the moment that monopolise the top 8 points in a clean race, all that needs to happen is Aston Martin to step back up to  make it a big 5 and the other teams won't have a look in. Therefore, I believe that the points system should be changed again and **all** drivers that finish a race within 2 laps of the winner should be rewarded with points, except last position.

The suggested points payout runs from the winner with the top 3 at 75-50-40, all the way down to 1 point for 21st place. This means the points tables will be a lot higher than what we have now, but they increased massively with the change in 2010 and other increase doesn't really change things in this regard. This system means that every driver has something to fight for, as long as the car/driver package is fast enough to stay close to the front-running pace. This prevents the situation we saw in 2010 when the three new teams were so ridiculously slow getting rewarded with points, it also prevents drivers/cars that DNF getting points, ever moreso putting extra importance on consistency. This means that, should only 15 drivers finish within 2 laps of the lead driver, points will only be paid down to 15th place. For example, in the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix won by Olivier Panis, with only 3 drivers finishing the race on the lead lap and one more a lap behind, these would be the only drivers to receive points that race.

I really do not see any negatives to the point system I suggested. As I mentioned, it will inflate the points tables, but they are already inflated anyway, but it puts extra importance on the race win with a large points difference between 1st and 2nd, with a massive points difference between 1st and, say 11th and below. This still means that, despite having points to fight for in the lower positions, compared to what the front runners are going to get it is still night and day difference. Sure, I would be open to suggestions for the actual points payouts but the biggest thing for me is that all drivers, within reason, have something to fight for whilst ensuring the importance of winning the race over 2nd place.

What do you think? Do you think the points system needs a revision, if so what do you think of my suggestion?","['No, a driver finishing in like 18th place does not deserve points.\n\nAdditionally, the lower points you are introducing are way more about how many retirements there are, and not quality of performance.

1. Started in Max's shadow at Toro Rosso  both were rookies, but Max got all the attention and eventually Red Bull‚Äôs full support.

3. Moved around a lot  Renault, McLaren, Ferrari  but never got the top tier  machinery at the right time but helped McLaren to rebuilt itself.


4. 2022-23 Ferrari drama When the car had potential, team strategy and inconsistency held him back.


5. 2024: Dropped for Hamilton even after outperforming Leclerc in multiple races.
