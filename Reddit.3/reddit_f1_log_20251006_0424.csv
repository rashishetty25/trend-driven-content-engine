It made me think about what this actually means for racing.

2026 F1 cars will have a 9 MJ battery powering a 350 kW electric motor, but the battery can’t be fully recharged every lap even with all the energy recovered during braking.

Even top tracks with strong braking zones only give back about 7-8 MJ to the battery, less than what the 9 MJ pack needs. Drivers can’t rely on using maximum electric power all the time without draining the battery.

On long straights, the battery drains quickly and regen can’t keep up. Teams will have to manage energy carefully and save electric power for key parts of the lap instead of using it continuously.

This limitation makes the new hybrid systems more strategic in racing, when and how you use electric power could decide battles and lap times.

Will this energy management create more strategy and uncertainty, or just become standard race management?","['Even as it is, it takes a lap to build up to have a shot at overtaking every 2nd lap.

1nyz4cu,George Russell redemptions arcs in Singapore 2025 and Canada 2025.

Singapore 2025:

After 2 years it seems like George Russell finally got rid of his ""last lap curse"".
2023 - Russell crashed on the last lap from P3
2024 - George drove into the wall in FP2, then finished the race in P4, suffering from heatstroke afterwards.
2025 - inserted himself into the wall once again in FP2. Got pole position with one of his best quali runs imo. Then executed flawless and dominant drive to win.

Canada 2025

2024: He got amazing pole position with the same time as Max. Beacuse of some mistake didn't capitalize on it fully and finished P3
2025: Got Pole position second time. Drove dominant race and finished P1.

In summary, in contrary to what many says Russell proves once again that he is able to analize his mistakes, learn from them and don't allow failures to get to his head too much.

Another telling thing is that after both Canada 2025 and Singapour 2025 he said sth like ""It is a payback for ...."" so these failures must have meant a lot to him 

I will probably get downvoted for this but I think that George this years can handle pressure very well ( better than Norris, Charles  and maybe even Oscar) especially in quali. Yesterday was not the first time that he wasn't super competetive in Q1 and Q2 but when it matters he got his shit together and got pole after 1st lap. Looking back this is a recurring pattern with him.","['Not sure how many podiums and poles he got last year but he’s defintely done well this year in a car that isn’t as good as McLaren’s.', 'What\'s funny is Leclerc and Russell have swapped places this and last season.\n\nRussell in 2025 and Leclerc in 2024 = uber consistent in a decent car to maximize podiums, rightfully receives a lot of praise\n\nLeclerc in 2025 and Russell in 2024 = in a less competitive car or team and so people think they\'re bad due to less podiums\n\nEdit: to be clear I rate them both very highly. Russell last season deserved far more praise than he got, my point is that people are acting like Leclerc suddenly got worse or Russell randomly became a top 3 driver this season when their performance has been pretty much the same across both. \n\n2023 was the last ""rough"" year for both of them, since 2024 they\'re both been super consistent.', 'I’ve always been a fan of George. I like him as a person and I think he’s an excellent driver. Most fans underrate him, imho. Not really sure why. Even the incidents people cite for the reason they hate him seem to be fairly mild and quite infrequent compared to some of the others.\n\nEither way, I was thrilled for him this weekend. He deserves all of the praise coming his way.', ""I think Russell has been proving for a while that he's good enough and has enough grit to win a championship with a good car. Dsq or not, what he did last season at Spa was ridiculous."", ""He's always been a top tier driver *and* he is still improving and learning from mistakes. If he was in any of those 2 McLarens he'd have the WDC in the bag already imo.\n\nI don't get why Mercedes hasn't locked him with a multi-year contract already when he's always been a Merc driver, he's still young but experienced and he's so consistent and good. They should just give him what he wants and not risk losing him because as soon as they give him a car that can consistently fight for wins he's getting that championship."", ""I think most people are coming around to him being one of the top drivers. He's definitely in the top 3, maybe even top 2 behind Verstappen."", 'He’s always been a great driver just the fans hated him for his posh accent 😂', 'George has always been good.

Pretty graphics, explanations for the lay person.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@chainbear\n\nBut at a certain point you just gotta watch the race. There's not a lot that can be distilled into a short post. \n\nIt's a racing series where the main differentiator is that the Teams or Constructors need to build the *majority* of the car themselves (as opposed to a spec series where everyone has the same car).\n\nSome teams build their own engines and are considered 'works' teams, other teams buy an engine from Merc / Renault / Honda / Ferrari are are 'customer teams'. \n\nThere is a Constructor championship (team) and a Driver championship (individual), so you get lots of drama where what's good for the team is bad for the individual. \n\nEvery race requires 2 sets of tyre compounds, so you see different strategies."", 'That’s awesome first of all that your son is interested and you might have a cool father-son activity together.\n\nI would go to YouTube, and just look up videos explaining things about F1 for new viewers.

That frustrates us all. :)\n\nAs for what makes it fascinating that'll be different for everyone, of course. For myself it's seeing twenty (currently) drivers who are so talented, fast and consistent that they can lap a difficult track within tenths, hundredths or even thousandths of seconds from each other competing in a sport where every decision is impactful. Tiny mistakes, tiny engineering details, taking a pit stop one lap early or one lap late can all have dramatic consequences.

Can Verstappen realistically win the WDC this season? Let's have a look at how many points per race he needs to score, or better, by how many points per race he needs to outscore Piastri and Norris.


6 races and 3 sprints remain. 174 point total. Max needs to catch 6.84 points per race weekend on Lando and 10.5 points per race weekend on Oscar every race weekend for the next six races.


 Of the 18 races so far this year he has managed to do that exactly once. Baku, the worst race of the season for McLaren and the best for him. Is it realistic to expect this to happen for the next 6 races in a row? ","['Possible but not realistic since it isn’t even really in his hands.', 'Possible? Yes\n\nPlausible? Not really', 'its increasingly less about how good max can drive and how badly McLaren could mess up. winning is unlikely, pushing Lando to p3 is still very possible.', 'Is it realistic? Sure\n\nIs it going to happen? Probably not.\n\nThat being said, I feel like an Oscar and Lando crash is inevitable and that could really make it juicy, especially with Max racing his face off lately.', 'I think after today the chances of Oscar and Lando colliding again are quite high. If they take each other out that could bring Max right into it.\xa0', 'Max is not winning the championship. Mathematically he has a chance but realistically absolutely not. He literally needs to win every race and sprint from here on with Piastri finishing third in all of them. Very very unlikely.', ""50% / 50%. Either it wins it or it doesn't"", ""Swap Verstappen and Russell in today's result and that's probably a typical worst case scenario for McLaren. They might have another Baku, but probably also a few wins. DNFs for anyone is not out of the question either. Run a few variations of those and maybe Verstappen wins 5-10% of them."", 'Only if both Mclarens crash with each other at least once with him taking the win.\n\nOnly then it becomes somewhat realistic.']",0,68,0.46,0,64,64,0,1,-0.019999999999999962,0

For me personally pre wing, or how Newey called them ""boring cigars on wheels"" would be the best.

Id find the championship much more fun if they switched several races on known difficult (boring, historical) tracks to historic cars. And could remove sprint races all together because IMO those do nothing to make it more appealing or interesting.

For giggles, search Charles crashing the 1970\'s Ferrari F1 car.\n\nAlso, have you never seen the Goodwood Revival?  Happens every year, and the perfect end to a summer [YT Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@GoodwoodRR) \n\nJust happened a couple of weeks ago.  Racers in old school cars, not rich people driving, but like rich people that buy cars, and pay ""jockeys"" to race it, in the hopes of winning.  Martin Brundle\'s son, Alex, just won a race.

Also, these cars are antiques that can't be replaced unless you expect the teams to build entirely new (albeit old) fabrication methods.
