I know he would’ve gotten more WDCs had he not passed away so early but, was he as good as Schumacher or Hamilton? Thanks.', '[https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/the-10-best-race-drives-of-f1-2024/10682787/](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/the-10-best-race-drives-of-f1-2024/10682787/)  \nAnyone with an autosport subscription go this list, I am am morbidly curious since Kalinaukas wrote it', ""What is your favorite pre-2000s race to rewatch? That one race that no matter how many times you watch it, it's still hype af."", 'Just started the Senna show on Netflix. VERY bold to start with the Imola crash.', ""Can someone explain the angle that's been trending that Yuki will overshadow Max and that's why Redbull chose Liam? \n\nSurely there's more to this than protecting *one*  driver's feelings?"", ""I'd say that Schumacher and Senna were the first ones to take it as a professional sport and started to push the physical limits for drivers to another level, but you really cannot compare drivers from such different eras to one another.  \n  \nCurrent drivers wouldn't take as many risks as they do now without many safety elements we have now that were not there, similarly they wouldn't take the risks of an exploding engine from the early years of the sport as they're not trained in a similar fashion to the physical demands of different eras."", 'The thing about Senna is that nowadays it\'s very hard to get a proper picture of his skills and as time goes on, it\'s getting harder and harder.\n\nDo you know the saying ""don\'t speak ill of the dead""? Nobody captures the meaning of that better than Senna. It is absolutely undeniable, that he was an insanely good driver. But exactly how good? Nobody knows, but it\'s 100% certain that he wasn\'t as good as people claim he was.\n\nFirst of all, it\'s easy to say ""well he was a 3-time world champion"", but 2 out of those 3 are extremely debatable. In 1988 he won because of some fucked up idiotic rule, Prost had far more points, but because of this rule Senna was crowned. And in 1990 he won by literally removing his opponent from the track. Deliberately crashing into him. And proudly admitting that he did. And people were like ""ok that\'s fine, no need for a penalty"". Not exactly how a ""goat"" wins championships, if you ask me.\n\nSecond of all, like I said, people just refuse to speak ill of the dead. The legend of Senna\'s greatness is similar to the fishing story your uncle always tells. Somehow that fish is bigger and bigger each time he tells the story. It started from a 50cm bass, then it was a 1m pike, last time he drank a bit too much and was mumbling something about it being a shark... so how big was that fish really? Nobody really knows, because the eye witness lies, always exaggerates and the level of exaggeration changes all the time. The same applies to how good Senna was.\n\nHe was good. He was well above average. But definitely not the goat. He\'s way overhyped by his fans which is like borderline a cult. Their words are simply unreliable.', ""Parking here so I can get some responses to look back and ponder! I can't answer the question directly, but I am currently setting my sights on Suzuka 2005, if that counts. Got a recommendation for that one and I heard it was good. I think I am about 10 laps into the race (from where I last stopped) and it looks promising! \n\nIn the meantime, I might ask for yours, since it might probably give me the nudge to contemplate whether it will be a good watch for when I want to!"", ""I totally forgot this came out.\n\nI'm confused by the fact it has a 38% on RT but a 8.3 on IMDB. Like that's a huge difference? I'm guessing F1 fans did not like it."", 'There’s no way that’s trending']",5,21,0.73,5,19,19,0,3,0.0,0
