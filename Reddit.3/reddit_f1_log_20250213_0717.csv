1inupbk,Opinion:  Haas and Aston-Martin are the biggest X factors this year.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1inupbk/opinion_haas_and_astonmartin_are_the_biggest_x/,2025-02-12, Discussion,"Haas, of course, gained access to greater technical resources than they've ever had before with their new partnership with Toyota.  If Komatsu is what he appears to be, they have a chance to move forward into the midpack for only the second time in their history in 2025.  It might not work, but a window to move forward has appeared for the team for the first time in at least 4 years.  

With many of the big players focusing significant resources on the 2026 regulation changes there's an opportunity to make some short term noise for one year, nail the final year of the old regulation to move up into the P5 range for one year to enhance their reputation, then accept you'll be a little behind on the new regs and play catchup eyeing 2027.  

or they could play it safe, look to 2026 and not worry too much about the car this year in the same way Vowles says he's going to do.

Bottom line:  With new backing and access to improved facilities, Haas has greater upside than they've had in awhile, and it'll be interesting to see if they can capitalize on it.

  
As for why I bring up Aston Martin, that should be reasonably obvious.  They don't lack for talent, and their facilities have improved considerably in the last 3 years, but they have a reputation of being one of the most directionless teams in formula 1.  For those of us familiar with the American NFL, I've referred to Lawrence Stroll as the Jerry Jones of Formula 1, which is still an apt comparison.  High profile signings. lack of coherent vision, a fetish for ""pet"" players that are somehow immovable even while they fail to get the job done.

The problem at Aston Martin is not a lack of resources, or good drivers.  Alonso is great, and Lance, despite the meme that he is, has his moments and is an adequate second driver.  But there is a vast lack of coherent vision at Aston-Martin.  The talent that Jerry... sorry Larry is bringing in is from different teams with different schools of thought, brought in without regard for how well their ideas mesh together, and without ownership making executive decisions on exactly how they want to attack the regulations, all the talent and facilities in the world won't create a great car.  Just ask Ferrari.  

Larry's identity seems to be simply be ""I have a lot of money and therefore should win.""  That doesn't work in a universe with a cost cap.  You have to have some idea what kind of car you want to build.  Fast in the straights, quick in the corners, light and agile or heavy and powerful.  You have the talent, personnel, facilities and drivers to do any of those things, but not all of them at once.  So pick one.

If Aston manages to figure that out they can move up in 2025.  But ironically the best chance of Aston figuring this out is if Lance, who has been front and center suffering from this rudderless, flailing, throw-crap-at-the-wall style of management, gains more pull on the management side of the team and his near decade of F1 driving experience allows Lance to come up with a concrete improvement plan, decide what HE wants to do, run it by his dad's people and starts building an actual identity for the team himself.  Will it happen who knows, but from where I'm sitting, it's the best chance for Aston to move forward and not backward.","['Maybe Aston Martin needs to build a car... for COMBAT.', ""Haas's performance has always largely been dictated by the performance of the Ferrari, rather than anything to do with management/team principals. It's no coincidence their cars mirrored each other in their areas of improvement last year. That will probably change this year with them deciding not to go down Ferrari's pull rod suspension route, so it will be interesting to see how they handle that."", 'Even AM themselves don’t expect to really improve this year.\nThey’re all in on 2026 regs now.', 'Late season AM is gonna be really interesting, they’ll be going at 100 percent by then with Adrian N and their facilities complete', ""With the new regs coming any mid to back marker team could be an x factor if they decide to keep working in this year's car after the others have moved on."", 'That’s a huge jump. Will Toyota’s initial impact be that huge? Yes Haas has a capable TP, financial backing and technological know how..however the competition isn’t sitting still. Williams have a great driver line up plus a good tp as well. In the next coming years Audi is also investing a ton in their resources. As for 2025, we may be in for a couple of surprises', 'Same post every year for the past 5 at least despite a consistent track record to the contrary. Inb4 they are 7th place again', ""They'll be fighting for the same positions as last season."", '> I\'ve referred to Lawrence Stroll as the Jerry Jones of Formula 1, which is still an apt comparison. High profile signings. lack of coherent vision, a fetish for ""pet"" players that are somehow immovable even while they fail to get the job done.\n\nFor Euros: Florentino Perez']",58,80,0.71,58,438,438,2,2,0.0,2
1io1wnc,"Recent seasons ""cleaner"" than the past?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1io1wnc/recent_seasons_cleaner_than_the_past/,2025-02-12, Discussion,"During this winter break I've been watching highlights from prior seasons to fill the time (thank you F1TV). They summarize each race in about 10-15min highlight videos.

So far I've watched 2009-2011, partway through 2012, and 2016. 

Prior to this, I've watched 2021-current live/during the season itself. 

My main observation from these older seasons is the prevelance of crashes, DNFs, and drive through penalties. It seems these past seasons had large percentages of those three compared to the last few seasons. '21 to now from what I've seen the drive through penalty isn't used nearly as often, there aren't huge crashes at every race, and most of the time the cars finish the races.

Any particular reasoning for this? Maybe what I'm noticing isn't actually true? Any thoughts? ","[""Back in the day the drive thru was the lightest penalty available. Nowadays 5 and 10 second penalties are applied almost every race, so I'm not quite sure what you're seeing about today's racing being cleaner."", 'The Super License system, as much as it forces young drivers through the FIA-sanctioned support series, has improved the average driver quality. Latifi and Mazapin looked like championship material compared to some of the pay drivers of the past. And the higher talent floor has been made clear though the reduction in crashes. \n\nAs for mechanical DNFs, the rules now limit the maximum number of engines and gearboxes (and components) that can be used before you start taking grid penalties. This has forced teams to design more durable parts.', 'Driving standards are FAR higher now than they used to be.\n\n20 years ago, Yuji Ide was so bad that his super license was revoked after only four races.\n\nNow we have Lance Stroll, who has 3 podiums and a pole position, as the worst driver on the grid.\n\nI think the current grid could make most drivers from back then look like amateurs.', 'Lots of answers here, but something that hasn’t been mentioned is that the cost cap rewards clean driving because you can’t just keep manufacturing replacements anymore.\n\nLook at Williams vs Alpine last year - at the start of the season both teams did not have a spare chassis. That bit Williams in the arse by race 3. Williams got to the point they were having to ask Mercedes for heritage parts, and they were running old spec parts at the end because they didn’t have anything else left. Alpine developed new ones because they weren’t trying to replace the old ones, so had development to the end of the season. \n\nIt encourages a balance of being fast vs not needlessly binning it.', 'One of the drivers, can’t remember which, said that the current cars are much harder to drive at the limit. So most of the drivers are pushing at about 90-95% because ultimately that is faster than 100% when accounting for mistakes that come with that. That helps to reduce DNFs and crashes.', ""The cars do most of the work nowadays thanks to the crazy ground effect downforce, whereas in the past drivers had to fight the cars more to get a lap time out of them. Add in tyres that can't be pushed and it becomes a pretty sanitised product."", 'The most recent season\'s have been much cleaner, and it can actually be attributed to this generation of cars and spec. I really wish I could find the article, but there was something that came out where current driver\'s were asked, and essentially with the ground effect cars, the way to extract the most lap time isn\'t to drive at 100%, but more \'smoothly\' and only at 80%-90% of potential. I think that goes a long way\'s to why we are seeing cleaner racing as of late; they aren\'t quite on the ragged edge in races as we used to see. That, along with other aspects such as cost cap, teams emphasizing and developing reliability vs. outright performance due to grid penalties, and just better drivers (less traditional pay driver\'s than previous decades of F1) all contribute to recent season\'s being ""cleaner"".', 'Past races were more open, w/o so many regulations.\xa0 My two cents.', 'Well no one has emerged from a fiery wreck in years so yeah']",18,30,0.68,18,29,29,2,2,0.010000000000000009,2

It’s all worked out well for McLaren ending up with Piastri so ultimately they needed Ricciardo to have worked out like that, but if they could’ve signed someone for 2021 that could’ve challenged Norris a lot better, who could that have been?","['He just shouldn’t have left RB.', 'Danny should have stayed put but Renault was his best option I guess if he was committed to leaving.\n\nMcLaren should have kept Carloslos.', 'Him going to McLaren was a very reasonable decision at the time. In 2020 he was one of the best drivers on the grid, he finished fifth in the championship in a Renault which was also fifth in the constructors. He was probably the best free agent going into 2021.\n\nI think his Renault seasons are very underrated', ""Staying at RBR was obviously the best option, he'd get beaten by Max but 2nd driver for the team that will win the WDC for 4 years in a row is not a bad deal, despite the performance Perez has had a lot more success than Daniel in recent years, and likely that Daniel would have done better."", ""All in all, with how McLaren progressed and how Renault/Alpine didn't, RIC to McLaren was a good move purely on team performance. Also for McLaren with Carlos leaving at the time i was ecstatic with the Danny Ric signing, seemed really good. For some reason it just never clicked with RIC in the car, was very rarely on it (luckily for him in Monza xd). Technically a good move with how RIC was performing and McL was on the up, but just never worked unfortunately.\n\nIn hindsight, RIC was better of staying put in Renault and Macca could have given Albon a shot, or retried with Stoffel or Hulk maybe from the free agents. Otherwise they could have tried to nick Russell or Piastri, either on loan from Merc/Alpine or trying to get them to join altogether."", ""I honestly think staying at red bull was his best bet, he was frustrated with red bull for favoring max, but he was also very frustrated with the horrible renault engine, yet his only choices to swap teams at the time were renault powered teams\n\nmax and daniel had very similar driving styles, so the car was always going to suit daniel, and staying for at least one or 2 more years to test the waters with the new honda PU would've given him a way better chance to succeed than renault ever could"", 'He shouldn’t have left.\n\nHe should have stayed at Renault if he was going to leave RB. They were ready to build that team around him.\n\nI suspect he’d still have declined. He didn’t get along well with the 22 cars.

If you didn't watch F1 and just the first season of DTS, you could very easily get the idea that Danny was better than Max."", 'Leaving Red Bull due to pride killed Danny Ric’s career the moment he left Milton Keynes. \n\nIt remains unclear WHAT Renault showed him to turn his head (likely bags of money) because the engines were an utter shambles.
