1lm5f09,[AMuS] McLaren strikes back,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lm5f09/amus_mclaren_strikes_back/,2025-06-27, News,,"[""What's next, Return of the Red Bull?"", 'Journalism is dead.\n\nMcLaren strike back and take their revenge‚Ä¶in Practice.\n\nDid a teenager write this?', 'This is stupid and AMuS is meant to be not.', 'Yeah, strikes back with a car so good an F2 driver can step in and go P4 in FP1.\n\nCome on.', 'Strike back from what? Being the dominant team this season to being the dominant team this season?', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **McLaren is taking revenge for its defeat at the Canadian GP. On the first day of practice for the Austrian GP, \u200b\u200bthe Papaya-powered cars were overwhelmingly superior. Barring a miracle, it\'ll be all down to second place between Red Bull, Mercedes, and Ferrari.**\n\n> In the first practice session, the McLarens held back. In the second, they struck. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri annihilated the opposition. The gap to third-placed Max Verstappen is 0.318 seconds, with a lap time of 65 seconds. Red Bull Motorsport Director Helmut Marko hopes: ""The actual gap is only one and a half tenths.""\n\n> On the first day of practice at the Red Bull Ring, McLaren\'s rivals didn\'t have much to offer. Max Verstappen limited himself exclusively to soft tires in the second practice session to reserve as many sets of medium and hard tires as possible for the race. Therefore, a comparison of the long runs isn\'t informative. Verstappen completed five laps on one set of soft tires and three on the other. Lando Norris completed twelve laps on the medium compound, while Oscar Piastri completed laps on Pirelli\'s hard tires.\n\n> In the long-run comparison, Mercedes and Ferrari aren\'t doing too badly. They\'re missing an average of a solid tenth of a second. The four top teams threw more or less significant upgrades into the battle. McLaren responded to the closing in on the competition with a surprisingly large package, giving itself some breathing room. Red Bull, however, wants to up the ante. ""There\'s more to come at Silverstone and Spa,"" Marko announces.\n\n> Three teams stand out in the midfield. Aston Martin set the fastest individual laps, but not with Fernando Alonso, but with Lance Stroll. Sauber\'s second upgrade worked right away, albeit only for one car. Gabriel Bortoleto was a regular in the top 10 all day, while Nico H√ºlkenberg still needs to work on the C45\'s setup.\n\n*Six things you need to know:*\n\n> **1) Who beats McLaren?**\nMcLaren was in a league of its own. Anyone who can be three-tenths or more ahead of the competition on a racetrack with lap times of 65 seconds is basically unbeatable. Added to that is the fact that Max Verstappen set his fastest lap later, in other words, in better track conditions. McLaren and Red Bull had both competed in Austria with upgrades. While the Red Bull engineers only modified the underbody edge, McLaren made a bigger impact with changes to the front brake vents, the front wishbones, and the rear axle. It was part two of a development step that had already been initiated in Montreal. Apparently with success. Neil Houldey, one of the team\'s lead engineers, explained that they now have several aerodynamic options that can be varied depending on the racetrack.\n\n> The comparison between the championship leader and his rival was diluted by the fact that McLaren and Red Bull pursued different tire strategies. Max Verstappen used exclusively soft tires in the second practice session. The McLaren drivers shared the workload. Oscar Piastri was sent out on hard tires, Lando Norris on the medium compound. In the morning, it was the other way around. It\'s no surprise that the McLaren drivers also set the tone in their specialty, albeit by a smaller margin than a single lap. Mercedes and Ferrari lost an average of just a tenth of a second.\n\n> **2) Can Mercedes repeat its Montreal victory?**\nIt doesn\'t look like it, and it wasn\'t expected either. ""The Red Bull Ring is a test for us to see whether our recent upgrades will work on a different type of racetrack than Montreal, on different asphalt, and in even hotter weather,"" explained technical coordinator Simone Resta. In the second practice session, the asphalt temperature dropped to 35 degrees. The heat is expected to return on Sunday. Despite this, George Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli could only manage sixth and eleventh places on one lap. The gap to the leaders is more than six-tenths. In the endurance runs, Antonelli was closer to leader Norris.\n\n> Montreal winner Russell surprised himself and the team with his fastest time in the first 60 minutes of practice. ""We then dropped back in the second part, which was a bit more in line with our expectations. We now have to figure out what we did better in the first practice session than in the second."" One reason could have been the green track. Mercedes is traditionally strong when the racing line hasn\'t yet been laid. Another was the change in wind direction. ""We probably reacted incorrectly with the setup and messed up the car\'s balance,"" explained chief engineer Andrew Shovlin. Antonelli admitted to some shortcomings with the soft tires. ""I still have to work on that in the third practice session. But the long run was really pleasing."" The numbers bear this out. Antonelli averaged a time of 1:09.740 minutes over 14 laps on medium tires. Lando Norris was only slightly better with a time of 1:09.666 minutes over twelve laps.\n\n> **3) How good is the new Ferrari underbody?**\nThat wasn\'t good timing. Ferrari brought a new underbody to Austria, from the front Venturi ducts to the diffuser, but gave one car to junior driver Dino Beganovic in the first practice session. Charles Leclerc sat out. In terms of data collection and feedback from the cockpit, it would have been better to have both regular drivers drive. Lewis Hamilton then lost valuable time with a gearbox problem. He ultimately set the second-fastest time.\n\n> In the afternoon, Ferrari split the program. Hamilton started on hard tires, Leclerc on mediums. Before the soft tires were deployed, the Ferrari drivers were in fourth and fifth place. With the soft compound, Leclerc achieved the fourth-fastest time. Lewis Hamilton slipped to tenth place. His Ferrari was fitted with a new gearbox for the second practice session. In the long run, both Ferrari drivers were on the same page. But that was already the case with the old underbody. ""The new one still feels like progress,"" insisted Vasseur. ""We just would have liked a few more laps to get more data.""\n\n(1/2)', 'Sometimes I wish they never even aired these FP sessions and we only start watching race weekends from Quali (or sprints). We are honestly analyzing a bit too much about these practice sessions. These sessions were not even  initially intended for normal viewers, they actually are mostly for the teams to analyze.
