Ferrari is Ferrari, and Red Bull is a one-man team.', 'Translation:\n\n> **McLaren proved to be vastly superior on the first day of practice at Imola. Over one lap and over the entire race. The only question now is: Who will finish second? Ferrari has the best chances in the long run, but they\'re one lap behind.**\n\n> After McLaren\'s one-two victory at the Miami GP, everyone was wondering: Could it be even more dominant? It could be, if the first day of practice in Imola were to be the benchmark for the rest of the weekend. This time, the McLarens had the better of the competition, even on one lap, with a lead of almost three-tenths. In the long run, that\'s for sure. There\'s a world of difference between McLaren and the rest.\n\n> The race for victory will be between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. Piastri beat his teammate by 0.025 seconds on one lap. In the race simulation, Norris had the edge by 0.045 seconds. However, Piastri completed two more laps on the medium tires. The close race between the Papaya Boys could be quite exciting for spectators. Perhaps less so for the McLaren command bridge. Will the first clash, which McLaren boss Zak Brown says is inevitable, take place in Imola?\n\n> Things remain exciting behind McLaren as well. On one lap, Mercedes has a minimal lead over Red Bull and Ferrari. Things are different in the long runs, where Ferrari excelled. Charles Leclerc\'s lap times averaged just two-tenths of a second better than McLaren\'s. ""But that only helps us if we\'re ahead of our opponents on the starting grid,"" team principal Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur told his team. Imola is a track with a built-in overtaking ban.\n\n> In the midfield, Alpine shone on one lap with the new C6 tire. Williams was stronger on the medium C5 compound. As a whole, you have to trust Williams more. Carlos Sainz\'s long run was over half a second faster per lap than Pierre Gasly\'s.\n\nSix things you need to know:\n\n> **1) Is McLaren unbeatable again?**\nThe first practice session ended with a one-two finish for McLaren. Oscar Piastri finished ahead of Lando Norris. But the lead over third-placed Carlos Sainz was razor-thin at 52 thousandths of a second. All were on the new C6 compound. The second practice session, on the medium tires, presented a similar picture: Norris ahead of Sainz, separated by only 0.040 seconds. There was still hope that McLaren would at least have to fight for pole position.\n\n> But on the soft tires, McLaren then unleashed a blast. Piastri and Norris were within just 0.025 seconds of each other. Everyone else, including Pierre Gasly at the front, was almost three-tenths behind. With a time difference of 1.127 seconds for the entire field, that\'s a class difference. Things got even worse for the rivals in the long runs. Only Ferrari was able to keep up. All the other drivers were on average half a second slower per lap. While the McLarens maintained their lap times consistently, their rivals\' times improved after five laps.\n\n> **2) Has Red Bull solved its problems?**\n\nYes and no. Even the Imola upgrade only partially cured the RB21\'s weaknesses. Max Verstappen initially reported understeer at the apex and oversteer on corner exit. But by the second practice session, the understeer had disappeared. ""Nevertheless, we lost four-tenths to the McLarens. That\'s too much. And in the race, the McLarens seem to be in a class of their own again,"" lamented Sporting Director Helmut Marko. Compared to the other teams, the assessment is cautious. ""We ran our normal program, but we have the feeling that some of them were perhaps a bit lighter.""\n\n> The latest development stage hasn\'t entirely failed to achieve its intended effect, but it hasn\'t brought Red Bull significantly closer to McLaren or away from its fellow sufferers Mercedes and Ferrari. Furthermore, the car bounces over bumps and curbs‚Äîa long-standing problem that has plagued Red Bull for two years now. Yuki Tsunoda\'s eighth-place finish was surprising, but even more so was the small time difference of 0.092 seconds. ""No one has been this close to Max in a long time. Yuki doesn\'t mind the oversteer as much. He complains less,"" Marko noted. The small time difference could also tell a different story, however. Namely, that Verstappen wasn\'t yet at his best. The world champion usually strikes when things get serious.\n\n(1/2)', '""Most competitive season yet""', '***Reaaaalllly*** interesting and helpful article. Thanks for the full translation!\n\nAnother interesting aspect, echoing recent races, is the apparently much better traction off the line from P2 on the grid. \n\nHave a look at the analysis by @lowerlaptime aka Martin on YT. \n\nThe C6 and the performances to date by Carlos and Pierre open up hope for their teams and the possibility of some teams going for a two-stop strategy.', 'Qualifying pace is too tight to say McLaren will definitely win', 'I think a formula 1 car might finish after the McLarens.\xa0', 'I mean in reality the top 5 will be probably a couple of tenths in it.

There‚Äôs a lot of cat and mouse here.\n\nThat said, nothing stops teams from lying to the media. They often do an It‚Äôs gamesmanship why reveal the purpose of a design innovation to rivals watching the same interview? For example, Red Bull‚Äôs 2022 floor edge design had people guessing for months.\n\nWhat‚Äôs wild is that teams often disguise their real tech even in plain sight like adding dummy parts during testing. So, maybe Aston Martin did say the ducts were for cooling the fuel tank, but maybe they‚Äôre really shaping airflow to energize the floor.', ""The FIA knows everything about the cars unless the teams specifically hide it.

And in fact they are required to not divulge secret technology."", ""I don't think there's anything stopping the teams from lying to the media, I'm sure they do at times. But I imagine if they don't want to answer they can just say so, it's not like the media can force the teams to anything."", 'As the body responsible for developing, scrutinising, and upholding technical standards, you‚Äôd assume the FIA have a great deal of technical knowledge across all teams.\n\nHowever, they will also have NDAs up the wahzoo to prevent the dissemination of that information.', 'The FIA usually does random checks on specific points. But in Miami they chose to randomly select the mclarens to inspect their brakes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njdyeIxfh7w', 'As I understand, teams are required to give complete and accurate technical information, both via standing orders (e.g. they submit CAD shapes for all parts) and in response to more directed inquiries. They are not, however, required to explain why they made various decisions, or how things work at a more abstract level. So someone at the FIA does know the exact shape/materials of the McLaren brake ducts, but they may not have been able to figure out why that shape works so well.', 'To the media they can lie as they want.\n\nTo the FIA, not really. We do not know what FIA exactly knows because no insider ever divulged that.\n\nThey know the design files for all parts and they can require even more information if needed. That doesn‚Äôt mean they understand how things work, like, they can know the suspension design and all the parts that constitute it but don‚Äôt ‚Äúget‚Äù how it helps anti-porpoise at high speeds. \n\nFrom what FIA says they know everything and are aware of everything but it is unclear they understand exactly how everything works in the designs they receive. \n\nAt least for aero parts FIA needs to approve everything, for more mechanical parts I don‚Äôt know if they also do it.\n\nPlease be aware there‚Äôs a lot of clouds on top of all this. FIA embellishes the story because they want the fans to absolutely not suspect of the integrity of the sport so they always say they know it all, are all super genius and everything is very well inspected.\n\nIn reality it probably isnt always like that. They do random inspections of parts and try to see if it complies regulations but they don‚Äôt inspect all cars, all weekends for compliance of all the rules. \n\nAnd then one thing is in theory another is real world.

But in 2011 and 2012 DRS was a bit too strong.\xa0\n\nBut in early 2022 F1 entered the best balance it has ever had and this resulted in imo the best Racimg we have ever had.\n\nWhen they got rid of porpoising in Belgium 2022 they also got rid of some of the cars ability to follow closely. Also in Hungary 2022 Aston Martin brought an update that increased the amount of dirty air coming out of the back of their car. This made them hard to overtake and everyone else copied them.\xa0\n\nHad the cars stayed like they were in the first half of 2022 this would have been the best regulations of all time.\xa0\n\nSeriously. Im not even just talkimg about Leclerc vs Max in Bahrain and Saudi. Im talking about having about three times the amount of overtakes there usually are in Australia.\xa0\n\nAnd Spain, even with the last chicane still there, had a great race with all the leaders having various plights and Russell and Verstappen having an amazing battle.\xa0\nIn Silverstone we had the best multi car wheel to wheel battle we‚Äôve seen in the last decade that was with the top cars.\xa0\nIn Austria there were battles everywhere and a five way battle at one point in the midfield where in about half a lap they all swapped around.\xa0\n\nEven France gave us \xa0loads of action and battles.\n\nAnd Hungary was the peak of it. Everyone made their strategy assuming overtaking would be difficult at what is historically the second or third worst track for passing. But there was overtakes galore especially at the head of the field.\xa0\n\nOn top of this tyres were wearing much faster than everyone expected. Bahrain, Spain and Austia were three stoppers!\xa0\nMost races were two stoppers and only about a third of them were one stop races. And the cars all had such different designs and even their paint jobs were more colourful.\xa0\n\nAlso reliability was a big factor with only Mercedes amd their customer teams having a consistently reliable car.
