It is also possible that he complained about the car and that annoyed people within Red Bull. Lawson on the other hand has been out in Q1 twice in two races, 0 points and is constantly getting stuck behind backmarkers. So I'd say 2019 Gasly was significantly better than Liam Lawson and Liam was put up too soon, meaning he has performed like this.","[""Looking at points is misleadimg because the field spread was so much higher in 2019.\n\n\nAs an example:\xa0\n\n\nIn China in 2019, Gasly qualified 1.4s off Bottas's pole time. This still got him P6.\n\n\nThat same gap to pole in 2025 would get you scraping in to P17.\n\n\nIn 2019 the slowest Quali time in China (set by Kubica in that godawful Williams) was over 3.7s off the pole time.\n\n\nLawson's P20 in China was only 1.533s off pole.

In 2020 he was doing ok but got in too many accidents(?), lost confidence and things went to pot.', 'Gasly argued with Newey his car was wrong of course he was fired', ""He was consistently in the points and in hindsight he wasn't as bad, but the benchmark at that point was Ricciardo and the expectation was to match Verstappen.\n\nNow years later Max isn't just a feisty young driver with a few wings anymore but a veteran 4 time world champion, and after him, Albon, Perez and Lawson the expectation has changed, and Gasly would those performances today would be more acceptable I think."", 'Gasly got points but he was miles away from the front. The field was a lot more spread out and Gasly was nowhere near his team mate. In his 12 races he had 2 DNFs, finished a lap down 5 times, was almost a lap down 2 times. Performances like that in the 2025 field would be on a par with Lawson', ""2025 and there's not more than a second between all 10 teams (maybe 9 sorry Sauber)\n\nWhat was the average spread between teams in 2019? \n\nYup, he's failed in that seat, big time. But he's actually been setup to fail in my opinion. \n\nHe's had F-All chance to practice or test and the car looks like it's the hardest to drive yet. \n\nWill be interesting to see how Yuki goes in the RB and how Liam goes back in the VCARB"", ""People forget that in 2018 and 2019 (probably 2017, can't remember) there was a huge gap between Top 3 Teams (Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull) and rest of the field. It was pretty much impossible for a non Top 3 car to finish inside the Top 6 without a Top 3 car having a DNF or problem.\n\nLook at Austria 2019: Top 5 is within 22 seconds but P6 is already a lap down down, but gasly finished P7 in a Top car.\n\nLook at China 2019: Top 5 is within 31 seconds, then there is Gasly in P6 another minute down.\n\nTHIS is why Gasly got replaced, not the absolute number of points, you can't compare it. The field is much much much closer today.\n\nAnother stat: in 2019 before Gasly got replaced all other 5 people in the Top 3 cars combined had **3** finishes outside the Top 5. Hamilton had a 1+ minute pitstop in Germany, Vettel had a collision and penalty in Silverstone, and Bottas had a collision and damage in Hungary. Gasly alone finished 6(!) times outside the Top 6 in 12 races."", 'Lawson had limited testing, limited practice at Australia and hadn’t driven the track before.

To be reintroduced today, the V10 must be detuned compared to back then, to fit inside the cost cap and the engine allocation limit. This reduces the power, and also the RPM, which was exactly what made the V10 sound good.\n\nAnother concern is the fuel tank. If it's naturally aspirated, it'll be far less efficient than the V6T + hybrid, so less power with more fuel consumption. If it's turbocharged, it probably needs more complex manifolds and bigger radiators than the V6T, so it'll be heavier, and due to the lack of hybrid it's probably still behind the current power unit in efficiency. Either case, the car will be carrying more fuel.\n\nSo I doubt the V10 will help make the cars smaller and lighter, or have higher power/weight ratio."", 'If the RB is the most difficult to drive car on the current grid, which one do you think is the easiest / most forgiving?

Currently each race is treated equally, worth an equal % of the score. Obviously this means that as time goes on each race will be have a decreasing impact on the positions, which is why from Japan I'm thinking of weighing it so the past races make up 50%, and the current race the other 50%.

Some big names with great primes that come to mind for me are Ricciardo and Massa. Granted, I haven't been watching as far back as their primes so I wouldn't know, but it truly feels like we have another uncrowned Champion in the making. 

Charles might have had mistakes earlier in his career but it really feels like he ironed them out last season and performs every race week. It's only early in his career but its possible we'll never see him lift the WDC Trophy despite being apparently more deserving than other names like Russel, Norris, or Piastri.

Like, that’s kind of a lie. He has done definitely what he should do and, he gave his best. He gave definitely a 100% performance, and, also, I gave 100%. It was in the end up to Red Bull how they’re going to do it.”\n\n“We’re still friends for sure, and we still chat each other, and I like to talk to him. And, yes, since 2020, before that, actually, we had a lot of time that we are teammates, driving in the same categories.”\n\n(via: GPblog)\n\nThey are used to competing with each other and have been rivals for many years. Lawson’s been more defensive in his recent comments about deserving the seat “he’s had his time, now it’s my time” and saying he beat Yuki in the junior series, he has no sympathy for Yuki getting passed over but I think that’s just due to the pressure and him trying to be all like i’m not here to feel bad for others/make friends i’m here to win etc.', 'They were actually good friends a while back.

He said 100%. Reasonable question, reasonable answer. He was asked if he’d do better than Lawson in the RB21 in China, he said he didn’t drive in it in China so he doesn’t know but he didn’t feel he was too far off Max in his Abu Dhabi test.\n\nLawson was told ‘Yuki is saying he’s ready to take your seat’ and Lawson has hit back saying ‘Well actually I beat him in juniors and F1 so he can say what I want’.
