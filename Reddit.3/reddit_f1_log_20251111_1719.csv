1otk0p0,2025 Antonelli v. 2007 Hamilton,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1otk0p0/2025_antonelli_v_2007_hamilton/,2025-11-10, Discussion,"With everyone on TV (Sky and F1TV) making a big deal that Antonelli has now scored the most points in a rookie season (122) surpassing Hamilton (109), I thought it would be interesting to compare and contrast what this actually means.

2025 - Antonelli has scored 122 points in 22 Grand Prix races and 4 Sprint races - 110 points from GPs and 12 from Sprints. This is in a season where championship points are awarded from 25 to 1 for the top 10 finishers in GPs, and  8 to 1 for the top 8 finishers in Sprints. In GP races alone, he is averaging 6.47 points per race.

2007 - Hamilton scored 109 points in 17 Grand Prix races; there were no Sprint races. In 2007 points were awarded 10 to 1 for the top 8 finishers. In those races Hamilton averaged 6.41 points per race. If the 2025 points system were in place for 2007, Hamilton would have totaled 263 points that year, averaging 15.47 points per race.

I think it's fair to say Kimi's rookie season has been very good, but isn't anywhere near as good as Lewis' rookie season in 2007. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.","[""It's a nonsense to compare different point system without conversion, so yeah, their points are really far apart."", 'Adjusting 2007 to the current system Lewis would have had 265 points or 62.4% of the maximum possible total (425), Kimi only has 21.6% (out of 565).\n\nAnd BTW that 62.4% is the highest someone who would have finished 3rd (Alonso gets one more point in the current system) has ever gotten.', ""I really wish they'd stop using the points scored stat unless they're comparing Kimi to another rookie 2010 or later."", 'More races and a whole different points system. 5th now gets the points that the winner got back then.\n\nSo I don’t think their rookie seasons are in the same league. Hamilton was fighting for the championship that season and by countback beat his 2x reigning champion team-mate Alonso.\n\nIt’s not like Antonelli has the machinery to fight for the championship unlike Hamilton did but Antonelli also has less than half the points of Russell.\n\nAntonelli is not bad by any means and drives like his debut, Canada and Brazil proves there really is promise in this guy. But Hamilton had the best rookie season in the history of F1 (unless we’re counting 1950).\n\nSo in this particular matter for Antonelli it is not a shame to be beaten by the best.', 'Lewis’ debut was sensational. It’s probably the one F1 record that might never get beaten.', 'People who think that Kimi did a better rookie season than Lewis : \n""My friend got 9/10 at his test, but I’m a better student because I got 11/20, and 11 is greater than 9 !""', 'No point paying much mind to points records as the system has not been the same over the years. Sergio Perez is 8th in all time points scored. Bottas is 6th.', 'This post is helpful for misguided newbies.', 'Not the biggest fan of Hamilton, but his rookie season was cartoonishly spectacular. I don’t think we have seen anything as good in the modern era of F1, nor are we likely to see something like that till the end of F1. 6 podiums in his first six races, scoring like 65% of the maximum possible points, being the bookie favourite for the WDC, mentally disintegrating the man who unseated Michael Friggin Schumacher. I mean obvious maths apart, that debut was so unrealistically unbelievable, they would have to fictionally nerf him when the biopic gets made just to make it seem realistic for the viewers. \n\nKimi’s debut season has been crazy good, but cm’on, Hamilton’s was a few light years ahead. Conservatively.']",4128,248,0.95,4128,8490,8490,42,2,0.0,42

I am more than aware that races/seasons in past decades have been snooze fests and at times had very minimal overtakes - however back then it was for a different reason - performance disparity up & down the grid.

We are so damn lucky to have such tight laptimes right now... I can't help but imagine what sort of racing & storylines we would have in modern F1 if the cars were an appropriate size.

I have a theory that F1 drivers are continuously caught up in clumsy incidents, purely because they have no other option but to roll the dice. Racecraft has changed completely, focusing on getting to the apex first - then forcing the outside car off the track. It's dull. These are the best drivers in the world, yet their cars don't allow them to be creative.

Sure, here and there we get a glimpse of how it should be (e.g. Piastri around the outside of Norris in Monza, Max just being Max), but we could have sooo much more.

I just sat through the extended highlights of 2009 on the F1 youtube channel, and on multiple occasions Button made the same passing move as Piastri (lockup and all), yet he pulled them off because the cars were smaller, more nimble. The racecraft was impecable in the 2009 Brazil race, so many crossbacks, divebombs, setup moves. Almost every passing move, the car being overtaken had a genuine crack at passing them back... that is motorsport.

Sorry to rant, but it's upsetting to know we are leaving so much on the table right now.

Thoughts?","[""People always complain about boring races, take the Schumacher years. Cars were a lot smaller, so that's not the only factor"", 'It factually is not just car size. Right now we have a similarly big issue of dirty air. The current cars are just so sensitive when it comes to aero\n\nSo car size is a big issue. Maybe the biggest. But far from the only issue. But it is a major safety gain. You can make them less picky with aero without compromising that crash safety.', ""did you see the race at the weekend?? difficult to say there wasn't good racing, you talk about impeccable race craft, but then also say they locked up, which part of locking a wheel is race craft?"", ""Car sizes are also a big part of the reason Gabi, as with many others is in one piece.\n\nI for one don't mind more boring racing if it's the price to avoid more fatalities"", ""A lot of the car size regulations is down to safety. I'd rather not the FIA start compromising on safety."", 'I don’t know man, if you watch a highlights reel, of course everything will look like sunshine and rainbows. \xa0My memory from this time is that races were often more boring than what we have today.\n\nHaving said that I agree that racing would be better with smaller cars. \xa0\n\nWhen I was young, I would read the old Indy Car fans saying “bring back front engine cars”. \xa0Now I’m feeling like an old bag myself, because I think they should get rid of hybrids and go back no normally aspirated and refuelling 😂', 'Everyone race in karts.', 'I think car size is the most overblown thing ever. Its not as if they literally wont fit on track beside eachother.  The cars are just simply too much similar pace wise and the aero has made the dirty air hinder lap times more. Also the tires being as fragile makes harder too (the races would be made better by less fragile tires, but it would be easier to follow without cooking them)', ""But for a few narrow tracks like Monaco, where cars can't really race side by side through most corners at all, it's not car size. \n\nYou need a performance delta to pass. Often it's 0.5+s per lap + DRS. Dirty air often prevents this, and car performance has converged to the point where we are seeing the closest margins in qualifying maybe ever in the history of F1. These cars lap the track very bunched, and DRS trains are more common than ever. \n\nThose races and that era also actively had fuel strategy teams could use to manipulate car weight, and tires they could ride hard for the entire race. This allowed for performance deltas to be created in more ways with pit strategy.\n\nTire compounds currently don't offer huge performance margins, unless you ride the tire off a cliff. Everyone manages their tires pretty well.\n\nAnd then you have just basic regulations that force teams to manage other issues. Ferrari has been a LICO machine all year to manage plank wear, for example. The floor is finicky, and stalling it at speed means a catastrophic loss of like 50% of your downforce and a guaranteed spin, so driving at the limit is harder because taking even one curb wrong ends your race (Piastri n the sprint).\n\nNone of this has to do with the size of the cars."", ""The issue isn't always the size, although in some places like Monaco it is. Some tracks are simply too narrow for good racing with these cars. \n\nDirty air is the main culprit here. How are you supposed to go wheel to wheel when you overheat the extremely sensitive tires because you're sliding around in the wake of the car in front of you? You now have no grip. \n\n\n\nAll of this is before we get into the loss of laptime from less cornering speed and comparatively bad exits onto the straights, the added deg to the tires adding to the total race time (less optimal pit strategy), and added heat into the brakes and engine from following the car in front.""]",0,27,0.38,0,25,25,0,0,-0.020000000000000018,0

1st: Lando Norris (390 points)
2nd: Oscar Piastri (24 points behind Lando)
3rd: Max Verstappen (49 points behind Lando)
With  3 races left (Las Vegas, Qatar, Abu Dhabi), with a total of 83 points still available.

Norris must be 26 or more points ahead of his closest rival after the Qatar Grand Prix to be crowned champion.

Remaining Races & Maximum Points (Total: 83)
 * Las Vegas GP: 25 points
 * Qatar GP (Sprint Weekend): 33 points (8 from Sprint + 25 from GP)
 * Abu Dhabi GP: 25 points

Lando Norris can  mathematically eliminate Max Verstappen, and second, he must secure the title against his teammate.

A: Eliminating Max Verstappen ( las vegas )
 After Las Vegas, 58 points will remain (33 in Qatar + 25 in Abu Dhabi). If Norris's lead over Verstappen is 59 points or more, Verstappen is mathematically eliminated.
 Norris must outscore Verstappen by 10 points in Las Vegas to be 59+ points clear.

 * Norris finishes P1 (25 pts), Verstappen finishes P3 (15 pts) or lower. (Gap = 59+)
 * Norris finishes P2 (18 pts), Verstappen finishes P6 (8 pts) or lower. (Gap = 59+)
 * Norris finishes P3 (15 pts), Verstappen finishes P8 (4 pts) or lower. (Gap = 60+)
 * Norris finishes P4 (12 pts), Verstappen finishes P9 (2 pts) or lower. (Gap = 59+)
 * Norris finishes P5 (10 pts), Verstappen finishes P10 (1 pt) or lower. (Gap = 58+, but Verstappen would lose on countback).
 * Norris finishes P6 (8 pts) or lower, he cannot eliminate Verstappen in Las Vegas, regardless of Verstappen's result.


 B: Winning the Championship vs. Piastri (Qatar)
Norris needs to gain just 2 net points over Piastri across the next two events (Las Vegas GP and Qatar Sprint/GP).


Scenario 1: Norris gains in Las Vegas
Norris wins (25 pts), Piastri finishes 2nd (18 pts).
Norris gains 7 points.
Norris's lead grows from 24 to 31 points.
Norris could afford to be outscored by Piastri by 5 points and still win the championship (31 - 5 = 26).

Scenario 2: Piastri gain in Las Vegas
Piastri wins (25 pts), Norris finishes 2nd (18 pts).
Piastri gains 7 points.
 
Norris's lead shrinks from 24 to 17 points.
The fight would go to Qatar, where Norris would need to outscore Piastri by 9 points (17 + 9 = 26) over the Sprint and GP to clinch the title there.

Scenario 3: DNF for Norris
 Piastri wins (25 pts), Norris has a DNF (0 pts).
 Piastri gains 25 points.
Piastri takes a 1-point lead in the championship.

C: Abu Dhabi
Any scenario where Norris leaves Qatar with a lead of 25 points or less will take the championship to the final race.
If the gap is 25 points, Piastri would have to win the race with Norris scoring zero points

He is not the big thing yet, but the 'next' big thing, so he is still yet to prove himself. You can't have proof right now of how he will perform in the future.

IMHO he is not having the best rookie season of all the newcomers this year."", ""Hadjar & Bearman have shown much more promise than him. Antonelli is an obvious talent otherwise he wouldn't be driving but he had a very humbling European leg which is expected of him. \n\nHadjar has constantly been superb for any season, let alone a rookie one. \n\nVery tough to judge Bortoleto as he's driving a shitbox."", ""He's been a truly impressive rookie, but I think this year we've learned that it's risky to call anyone a champion until it happens.

1ou251n,The McLaren swap in Italy may decide the championship.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ou251n/the_mclaren_swap_in_italy_may_decide_the/,2025-11-11, Discussion,"Piastri gave up 3 points to Norris by making the swap.

If Piastri wins the final three races and Norris comes second in the final three races Norris would still win the championship by 3 points.  

May come back to bite Piastri after all of these weeks.

In doing so Piastri’s destiny is now out of his hands in these final races. Wonder what peoples thoughts are now that decision has come to fruition.

Yeah, I mean I think today was a fair decision. Lando was ahead the whole race and again, it wasn’t through any fault of his own so I think for me that’s fine.
