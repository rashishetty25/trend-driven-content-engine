Montezemolo decided to rock a steady boat with Schumacher, Todt and Brawn at helm because he was hurt and affraid due to him not being as revered as the aforementioned trio and because he started to lose the political power within the team.

Any time they get grumpy, it's a little bit actually towards me and Andrea because we're trying to be fair and balanced. And I think the fact that they've both been a little bit grumpy at times with us actually tells you things have been fair and balanced because we're trying to make sure they race clean, and they are.  
  
All the incidents that they've had, which isn't that many, have all just been, at the end of the day, racing incidents. But we want to make sure the championship's decided on the track and not through that. I think we're lucky that we have the two drivers that we have.  
  
I'm not sure that Andrea and I and the team would be able to manage other drivers the way we can Oscar and Lando. So I think a lot of credit is due to just who they are as individuals. And that's part of our recruiting process for drivers is character, and do they do they think like us? And we talk about the elephant in the room all the time.

Having the possibility to get it in French is a plus.

Many thanks.","[""I can help! I'm a librarian and we have some F1 books in our kids section. What is the age range we're looking at?"", ""Since Jean-Louis Moncet's ~~memoir~~ (ETA: oops, didn't realize he had another book, but the sample of it looked reasonably similar) is on your list, perhaps you might consider the books from publisher Quarto's Ivy Press imprint's “Formula One” series, even though they might be on the pricier side.\n\nThey have an entire set of coffee table books covering different aspects of F1 historically up through modern-ish times, with lots of photographs. The level of English doesn't seem too complicated, and the mini-essay text pieces aren't that long, and accompanied by plenty of easy picture captions.\n\nThey're written by former F1 journalists including Maurice Hamilton (previously a motor racing correspondent for The Observer newspaper, and now a BBC Radio 5 commentator, according to his bioblurb), Tony Dodgins (previously with Autosport, now an occasional BBC TV commentator), and Frank Hopkinson (former deputy editor of F1 Racing magazine), and come with introductions by figures like Sir Jackie Stewart, Damon Hill, Mark Webber, etc., and include anecdotes as well as facts. There's something like 7 total so far on different topics such as circuits, controversies, and pivotal events. _Formula 1: The Pursuit of Speed_ which seems to be kind of an overview of the sport, but is from 2017 so it may be out of print in paper.\n\nI have the ones for _The Champions: 75 Years of Legendary F1 Drivers_ (also with quotes and vintage interviews; goes from Farina up to Verstappen) from 2025 and _The Rivals: F1's Greatest Duels_ from 2023 (16 chapters going from Fangio vs. Ascari up to Hamilton vs. Verstappen). I got them as ebooks bought during discount sales so I can't comment on the print quality of the paper editions, sorry, but they're pretty nice. You can see samples of the interior text/pictures over at the publisher's website catalogue at Quarto.com via the Google Play previews for the more recently published books.\n\nAlso, _Formula One Racing For Dummies_ by Jonathan Noble (journalist for Motorsport.com and The Race) is available in French translation as _La Formule 1 Pour Les Nuls_ and is reasonably up to date, informative, and easy to read. But very few pictures, mostly sort of line drawing diagrams.\n\nHope this helps!"", 'https://www.redracerbooks.com might be a little young but if they’re learning English it might work.', 'Maybe “Drive to Victory” by Karun Chandhok', ""Almost 11. He's loving learning English at school so that could be a good motivator to learn words and specific vocabulary while reading stories or fun facts about F1.\nPictures would still be something important.\nWhat kind of options would you have in mind ?"", ""That's a perfect answer, thank you"", ""That's a bit too young, thanks for the suggestion."", 'We have some simple books on the subject, probably more suited to a 7-9 year old native English speaker. The books we have are a little older (I\'m guessing pre-2022) and are thin, but have great pictures. I\'ll grab them tomorrow when I\'m at the library and send you the ISBN. \n\nIt\'s likely that these same books are translated into other languages. I believe they come from a company that puts out a lot of ""About (insert sport here)"" kinds of books, so I\'d assume there is a good market for multiple languages.', ""I wouldn't shy away from a bit more technical books or for older kids, as I was aiming for the 2 books I mentioned earlier, unless better options are up for grabs.\nBut please, carry on with the ISBN.
