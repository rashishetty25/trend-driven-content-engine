1kmrbr9,Why does Ferrari consider Monza as the “home race “instead of Imola which is names after Enzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kmrbr9/why_does_ferrari_consider_monza_as_the_home_race/,2025-05-14, Discussion,"Even though Imola (Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari) is named after Enzo and Dino, I’ve noticed that Ferrari always places more importance on the Monza race, considering it their true home race. Ferrari’s victories at Monza in the past have been among the most important to the team, second only to winning the Championship. 

Is there a historical reason for Ferrari’s greater attachment to Monza?","['Imola wasnt always on the calendar and Monza has always been the “Italian grand prix”', 'Monza has been the Italian GP since 1949 except for 1980. Enzo particularly liked Monza for its Straights and called it an engine circuit', ""Because it's hosted the Italian GP since 1922 (with the exceptions of Livorno in '37, Portello in '47, Turin in '48, Imola in '80, and the inaugural edition in Montichiari in 1921), while Imola has been a GP venue only since the Imola Grand Prix in '63, and in a stable way only since the Dino Ferrari GP in '79, the 1980 Italian GP, the dispute with the ACI and the Sammarinese GP's institution.\n\nNaples, Pescara, Siracusa, Modena, Pergusa, Rome, Vallelunga, Bari, Sanremo have all held a Formula One race before Imola.\n\nMonza has got more continuity and is the more historical race between the two, as showed by the fact that Imola will go and Monza won't. If you have to elect one track as your home one, you better choose the one that's guaranteed to stay.\n\n\nAs an Italian and a Lombard, Monza obviously feels much more important to me than Imola, I like Imola but it's not more important than Pescara or Brescia or the Madonie circuits racing wise.\xa0\n\n\nAlso Monza has a better track with good races so it's more marketable I guess."", 'I’m not entirely sure, but I think it might have to do with Imola being run as the San Marino Grand Prix for many years. Monza has always been the ItalianGP and has been on the F1-calendar since the start in 1950. Whereas Imola was added to the calendar in 1980 and only hosted the ItalianGP in its first year. Perhaps it is therefore they consider it their home race more than Imola.', ""Because Monza is a constant, the home of *The* Italian Grand Prix, it's the big one, with history, prestige, Imola just has brief flings with the series every now and then. \n\nThe same reason RB consider Monza their home GP too, despite being closer to Imola."", '“Home races” don’t really have a hard fast rule… it could be a home race if it’s in the country where the driver was born or lives, the teams current base of operations, or a sponsor is based.

1kmumty,What would have happened if Hamilton or Verstappen had tested positive for Covid-19 in the final races of the 2021 season?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kmumty/what_would_have_happened_if_hamilton_or/,2025-05-15, Discussion,"I’ve been rewatching some races from that season and it's clear how the threat of Covid-19 was always looming around the paddock.

We saw cases like Mazepin (Abu Dhabi GP) and Raikkonen missing races that year due to positive tests.

Hard to do that if they're staggering around the paddock, delirious with a fever."", 'Max probably had covid during the 2021 Saudi GP. They would have kept it quiet and let them race.', ""Personal theory is that an FIA fixer would've paid the problem away.

He also wasn’t up against a great set of drivers, with Lauda falling off after 78 and Prost still green through around 82 and possibly longer.\n\nHowever, a lot of mathematical models don’t really back up my (admittedly very basic) assessment and rank him as quite clearly the top driver overall during his time in the sport.

Is it understood that the Monaco mechanical failure, Zandvoort tyre blowout and having to stay behind at Monza - and to some extent an unavoidable incident at Zolder forcing him to burn through his fuel in an effort to rescue a result - cost him compared to Scheckter, whose only real setback was a DNF at Watkins Glen after the title was won?\n\nIn 1980, some believe that being given the worst Ferrari of all time caused Scheckter to check out. Is this possible? Or can we draw no other conclusion than Villeneuve being simply that good?\n\nIn 81, how much do those two wins distort the true picture of Villeneuve relative to Pironi? From watching the season review, it seemed like Pironi was a bit closer at a good chunk of races than the championship standings indicated.

For example - i think something would have to happen to both McLarens and Max for George to pull away with a win. I don’t think he gets around them on a normal weekend. 

On the other hand - I think poor Borteleto would need practically the entire field DSQ or DNF to get the win due to the car and him being a rookie. I’m not sure who I think he could realistically beat. 

I think Leclerc could pull a win as long as one McLaren was out of the running, and Ferrari didn’t do Ferrari things but it would still be tricky.
