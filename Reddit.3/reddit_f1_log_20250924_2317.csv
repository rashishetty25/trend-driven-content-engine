1np9zmr,A series of questions about “low downforce”…,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1np9zmr/a_series_of_questions_about_low_downforce/,2025-09-24, Technical,"The recent conversations about red bull’s step in performance and whether it is just track-based have raised a few (semi-related) questions for me that im just gonna lump under this post. Feel free to address any portion of it. Apologies for length.

I understand that red bull performs better on low downforce or low deg tracks which i understand to be a recurring feature of their car, not just this year. But then im reminded of vegas 2024 where there was a lot of discussion about their lack of low downforce wing. It had been speculated that they just forgot to bring it and then eventually it was said that they just never developed it. Are they able to get away with not developing for the lowest possible downforce because they already tend towards lower downforce configs? If so, why did they wind up needing to take a saw to their wing?

Follow up question. What about the car makes it better for low downforce vs mclaren? Is it just that the car inherently generates less downforce because of its design? Or are they doing something specific? In simple terms, what is determining how much downforce a car has?

Finally, when we talk about low vs high downforce tracks, my simplistic understanding is it just that low speed corners and straights require less downforce and dont want drag. And high speed corners require the car to kind of stick to the track more? Is there more to it than this? And also, silly question, what makes a corner fast vs slow, what about the corner itself drives this?

TIA!

Edit: i realized i wasnt paying attention and reversed what i meant. That high speed corners need less downforce and low speed required being glued to the track more, right?","['So different cars have different strengths.\n\nDownforce comes at a cost of drag, if a team can generate their downforce cheaply for very little drag then it means they can generate more without losing too much top speed.\n\nThis is a huge advantage.\n\nHowever once you come to low downforce circuits this advantage can be wiped out as you aren\'t bolting that downforce on.\n\nSome cars inherently more ""slippery\' through the air and naturally generate less drag making them well suited to low downforce circuits. Has often been a feature of Williams cars for example.\n\nBut once they try and bolt the downforce on it is less effective with lower peak downforce figures and more costly with higher drag penalties for a given level of downforce.\n\nAs to why Red Bull didn\'t develop low downforce wings it becomes a cost benefit analysis. If the low downforce parts are only useful for a couple of races then that development effort and budget might be better spent elsewhere.\n\nIn the days of infinite budget you can guarantee that every team would have a Monza and Monaco specific package if they could afford it.\n\nIn days of budget caps teams need to be more sensible with their spending and develop things with wider use windows.', 'Downforce and Drag are related. \n\nThe same aero elements which keep you glued to the track in medium and high speed turns create drag on the straights which reduces your top speed.\n\nWhich is the whole concept behind DRS', ""I could be wrong, but low and high downforce setups are tweaked with the front and rear wings, but the floor isn't tuned differently per track. So having a car thats good on low downforce tracks probably means you have a very good floor design that doesnt produce much drag."", "">i realized i wasnt paying attention and reversed what i meant. That high speed corners need less downforce and low speed required being glued to the track more, right?\n\nEvery corner is helped by having more downforce.\n\nA car with high downforce will take a high speed corner even faster than one with less downforce.\n\nOnly time that doesn't help is if the car isn't grip limited around the corner (something like Curva Grande at Monza turn 3).\n\nDownforce is a compromise between straight line speed and cornering speed.\n\nExcessively low speed corners don't benefit as much from downfoce as downforce only really kicks in above 100kmh really, so it is more noticed in medium and high speed.\n\nThe length and frequency of the straights determines downforce levels more than the corner profile really."", 'Downforce is related to the car with the equation. This is generally produced by the wings and other aero pieces that can generate lift (negative lift):\n\nF = - (ρ * Cl * A * v^2) / 2\n\nCl is the coefficient of lift. Hence the - sign. \nρ is the density of air\n\nDrag is related to downforce with the equation: \n\nF = Fd^2 / ( π * AR)\n\nFd is the force of downforce and AR is the aspect ratio of the wing. \n\nThese are very basic ways to look at complex systems but you can see how downforce increases with the square of velocity and drag increases with the square of downforce. This means the efficiency of a car to produce downforce massively impacts drag. So each team is trying to maximize Fd while absolutely minimizing AR. So that means you need to create efficiencies with the total area and the cross sectional area. This is all occurring downstream of other effects so you also need to calculate the impact of all of those leading to the surface you are trying to optimize. In general when people say a car is good in low downforce its probably something along these lines', 'I built an aero package for my F1600 car to fuck around with on open track days, so maybe I can speak to this a little more concretely with what I’ve learned. \n\n1. Peak downforce for a given package isn’t the end goal of any setup barring a few special cases that aren’t applicable to GP Racing. It’s better to have a lower DF figure that generates the load more efficiently (I.e. minimizing the lift:drag ratio) than it is to have a wing that generates nominally more downforce but induces a significant drag penalty. \n\n2. Downforce is only useful if you can put it through the tires effectively, meaning your suspension architecture has as much, if not more, effect on the performance of your car around a lap than your aero package. \n\n3. The downforce you add to a vehicle must act at the correct point in space relative to your center of gravity. This is the center of pressure, or CoP. A highly dynamic CoP makes the car less predictable under dynamic loads (I.e., braking and turning, accelerating while turning etc), so the ideal aero package is invariant under yaw, pitch and roll for a given velocity. This, again, is more important to overall lap time than the nominal downforce figure, as it allows the drivers to reliably push the car without fear of snap oversteer or understeer (which can’t be a snap, but still undesirable)\n\nIt’s entirely possible that RBR was unable to develop a low-df package that was balanced enough to outperform their mid-tier package without making significant changes to the chassis. It’s also possible that the rear wing cut was to alter the aero balance due to atmospheric factors. There’s no way to sufficiently constrain our variables enough to know for sure why their package works the way it does or why it’s relatively strong/weak in comparison to others.\n\nWith respect to tracks, it’s easier to explain sector by sector rather than track by track. Let’s use COTA:\n\nSector 1 is dominated by fast, flowing corners with quick changes in direction and elevation. Increasing downforce on the car will result in a faster sector time, since the car’s speed is limited by its ability to corner.\n\n\nSector 2 is composed of two straights separated by a slow hairpin. The drag induced by Downforce here is a significant penalty, since the car has to push through the induced drag to get up to top speed. \n\nSector 3 is a combination of slow and high-speed corners and a short straight to the start/finish line. \n\nFor COTA, the teams would run a setup that is a compromise between high and low df, to try to maximize time gained through sector 1 and 3 while minimize time lost due to drag induced Sector 2.\n\n\nIn general: tracks like Hungaroring and Qatar are high-df tracks due to fast corners and high-speed change of direction, while tracks like Imola, Canada and Monza are lower downforce, since the corners are comparatively slow and separated by straights.', ""A few things seperate from the excellent answers already here\n\na. Mark Hughes talked about how McLaren were best on the compound that...uh...noone raced. And even on the meedyums, McLaren would've still been up front (ish) with a typical qualifying session.\n\nb. Last year it seemed RBR just elected not to focus on it, because it's quite rare. They all used to do packages for e.g. Monza, but often now it's not worth the relative benefit to your entire season.\n\nc. Apparently a lot of what dictates this era is not so much low/high downforce, but rather the variation in high/low speed turns for a given circuit, because much of the challenge nowadays is a car which maintains good downforce across both: by staying as low as possible without bottoming out."", ""Probably Newey et al now exactly why the RB is not good at high downforce levels, but based on what has been said about the car I reckon that too high downforce puts the car into an operating envelop, where the underfloor is more likely to stall making it so edgy to drive. With lower levels of downforce seem to lessen that problem, while still producing good L/D numbers.\n\nThat's the key to a superior low downforce car. Creating downforce always comes with drag. If you can create more  downforce for less drag your car is going to be more efficient and can thus run less draggy setups for the same amount of downforce than other teams. That is in part the brilliance of the ground effect car, it's a lot of downforce for very little drag penalty comapred to over the car aero.\n\nGenerally speaking downforce is king, there is litterally only Monza that is a true low downforce track these days. All others are mid tier apart from Singapore, Monaco and Budapest. And DRS on top of that makes even Monza less of a low downforce track.\n\nFor a better comparitive study of low vs high downforce kit, go back and compare 1990s spec cars at Monaco/Budapest vs Monza/Hockenheim. The former two no regard its given to drag, because you want all the grip and more you can get, the latter you want none of the drag. Also for the latter, compare the amount of rear wing visible on low frontal shots of the top cars vs the tail enders. Notice something? That is horsepower, the top teams have 50-100 ponies more and can afford to run draggier setups."", 'What makes a corner fast or slow?   Exactly the same things you find in normal road driving....\n\nThe tighter the corner, the more you have to slow down....   \nVery gentle curves may not require slowing at all and can be treated as straights,  a corner with a short radius requiring significant change of direction in a short distance will require slowing...\n\nCompare Lowes hairpin at Monaco, and the ""back straight"" at Melbourne which actually curves around the edge of a lake....\n\nNow, other factors can play a smaller part... How smooth the surface is, whether there\'s any camber or banking, how wide the track is ant corner entry and exit....   But the main thing that affects how fast you can take a corner is how tight a turn it is....', 'I dont think its downforce.  Its how the cars take the corners, the differential. The parts of the cars we cant see.  The Mclaren has a more open diff which is great for keeping trye tempts down and keeping grip through the corners.  The RB/Honda has a more closed diff.  This helps at tracks where ypu need to put power down right away and make haste asap, Monza, Baku.  Closed diffs are supscetible to over steer if you dont know how to control it... sound familiar?  Baku and Monza have high speed sections out of slow corners. That closed diff helps.']",49,38,0.82,49,38,38,4,0,0.009999999999999898,4
