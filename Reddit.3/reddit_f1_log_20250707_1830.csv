Afterward, he said he only saw the red rear light at the last moment‚Äîtoo late to react.

**That made me wonder: why do F1 rain lights still blink during heavy spray?**

In light rain, blinking might help grab attention. But in dense spray, the off-moments make the car ahead briefly invisible, which is exactly when you need to see it. A solid, constantly lit rain light would likely be more visible through the mist, even if less ‚Äúattention-grabbing‚Äù on paper.

According to older threads and technical docs, the rain light flashes at ~4Hz in wet conditions and ~2Hz during ERS harvesting, but a solid mode does exist (like during pit limiter). Why not use it when visibility is at its worst?

With wet races becoming more common, shouldn't the FIA consider making the rain light stay on instead of flashing in extreme spray?","[""A blinking or strobing light demands your attention, a single continuous light would eventually start being ignored because it's there constantly. It's why every emergency vehicle has strobing lights."", 'Having two lights side by side in each of the three ""points"" of the triangle, that flash on and off alternately, would possibly help.\n\nThat way there\'s a light visible all of the time, but the flashing makes the light move to still draw attention to it.', ""I've raced in rain worse than this weekend.

I just have a question for the physics-minded people. How much does the stopping distance vary on a F1 car when applying 60psi of braking pressure in Wet vs Dry conditions?

I see everyone is comparing George's 30 psi (in the dry) to Oscar's 60 psi (in the wet) and saying Oscar 'stopped twice as quick'. From my understanding, this is not accurate. I am under the assumption a better metric that the FIA would use as a baseline or threshold would be to look at the deceleration values?

Obviously Oscar shedding the 100mph was significant, but the timing in which he does so should be mentioned also and used as part of the baseline.

All just my thoughts, I'm interested in what everyone else has to say. Would be fun to have the raw data!","['It‚Äôs the effect on the guys behind.\n\nThere was massive spray for the guys behind Piastri - he was essentially the only guy with a clear view.

He‚Äôs very lucky none of them actually crashed.', 'r/f1technical is probably the better forum if you want better answers than ""he broke 2x as much.""\n\nEspecially considering the FIA in the Russell document didn\'t even comment on the brake pressure argument put forward by mercedes', ""I think both are important.\n\nYou can't just use stopping distance alone because the conditions mean that it is more difficult for cars behind to both see Oscar's braking and then stop in time. So even if he took longer in terms of distance to slow down that Russell did, it could provide more of a hazard."", 'So long as the tyre has grip I would assume they are the same.\n\nThe caliper acts on the brake disc and applies a braking force relative to the pressure on the pedal.\n\nThat will slow the wheel rotation down by the same ammount UNLESS the tyre loses grip and locks.\n\nNot a physiscist or engineer, but that is how my logic works on this.', 'G-force generated under breaking is the correct measurement.\n\n\nThe FIA could have easily fixed this issue of gaming restarts by writing rules that remove them as a competitive aspect of racing.', 'Idk why anyone is looking at psi instead of Gs. Unless that data is not available.', 'I don\'t think setting a limit on brake psi is useful, nor is it the intended purpose of the FIA. Stopping distance cannot be easily calculated from the psi. Also no one was stopping, they were braking within the limits of grip. \n\nThe vague point of erratic driving points to ""risk to the guy behind"" which in this case has a lot more to do with visibility. ""Max cannot see you because of the spray so this is not the time to throw up a surprise and brake harder than any other race leader has done behind the safety car in recent years.""\n\nThe Russell comparison is just to illustrate that last point: show what has caught out the number 2 man in the past even without the visibility issue.', 'Brakes in racing cars are different than in road cars, and braking is a different process too. The braking action can be very violent for max effectiveness. Typically, when a car needs to brake for a corner, the driver slams on the brakes quite hard and then gradually releases. That\'s kinda the opposite of what you (should) do in a road car.\n\nI can\'t find good data on how much psi F1 brakes do, but apparently it can be up to 2000 psi? So 30 or 60 really is not much, definitely not proper corner braking, more like gentle slowing down like in a road car.\n\nI guess that\'s why the McL people were saying it just looks more dramatic on TV due to how fast the cars are and how the brakes work.\n\nIn that context, Russell\'s 30 psi makes even more sense that he was just warming them up, even if it looked like hard braking to us.\n\nAs for the rain, I\'m not too sure but I\'d guess that\'s the same like in a road car. If you brake too hard, the guy behind you is more likely to ram you even if the overall braking distance is longer, so braking inherently carries more risk. I also imagine F1 drivers are more gentle on the brakes in the rain to keep better control, so maybe even 60 psi is into the ""don\'t do that"" territory in the rain.\n\nBut I\'ve also seen an explanation that the main difference between Russell\'s and Piastri\'s situation was that Russel was still behind an active SC with its lights on, while Piastri was essentially under racing conditions with him controlling the speed, not the SC. So it was his responsibility to not do anything that can be seen as erratic.\n\nNote: I\'m not an F1 driver', 'Just have to let the Brit win. \n\nHe literally got the same penalty Max got for banzaiing into another car on purpose.']",0,17,0.4,0,15,15,0,0,0.020000000000000018,0

4. Mclaren - Strong podium contender but given there extreme development to secure title this year it may be hard for them to compete for titles in coming years however the merc engine will work well for them

5. Williams - will be close with mclaren due to williams ignoring this year to focus on next regs and also having the merc engine, will have disadvantage due to lack of funding

6. Red Bull - Implosion for red bull with verstappens departure seeming iminent, newey wheatley leaving and horner may be out aswell, the switch to full works team may disadvantage them.

7. Alpine - Merc engine will be only saviour of this car

8. Haas - probably will have better aero and chassis than alpine but the new regs are mainly engine focused

9. Cadillac - New team so has catching up to do although will be working all throughout this year to try and catch up

1lt8gv5,Piastri‚Äòs penalty undeserved?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lt8gv5/piastris_penalty_undeserved/,2025-07-06, Discussion,"Edited see below

During the race, it looked quite clear that Piastri just tried to surprise Verstappen to give him a penalty. I just had a look at the telemetry from the live timing, and it paints a different picture. 

During the first safety car, Piastri decelerated from 207 to 65 kph in 3.3 sec (3.3 sec of hard braking). Verstappen went from 219 to 75 kph in 3.5 sec, they started braking at ca. 1/5 of the straight and basically simultaneously. 

During the second SC, Piastri went from 215 to 70 kph in again ca. 3.2 sec, for Verstappen it was 221 to 60 in 3.1 sec, so similar to the first SC. But Piastri started braking at 1/2 of the straight (so quite a bit later), the key here is that Verstappen only started to break 1.5 sec after Piastri. Piastri had already decelerated to 120 kph when Verstappen reacted. 

Looking at Verstappen‚Äòs onboard also gives a bit more additional information. During the acceleration down the straight, there was a lot of spray from Piastri and the safety car, so his visibility was reduced and he received a radio call that the SC is ending. I think both of these factors have contributed to his delayed reaction, which then in turn led to a very high closing speed, which forced him to evade Piastri. That obviously looked quite extreme off-board. 

I think, given that the call for the ending SC came relatively late and then Piastri‚Äôs need to allow the SC to go into the pits and the track to go green before he hits turn 15, gave him cause to decelerate quickly. It is not his fault that Verstappen didn‚Äôt notice him braking for almost 1.5 seconds. Just to be clear, I don‚Äôt think Verstappen is at fault here either, it‚Äôs just that his delayed reaction makes Piastri‚Äòs braking look quite extreme. From Piastri‚Äôs on-board (which faces rear) his braking doesn‚Äôt seem quite so strong and it looks like Verstappen just doesn‚Äôt brake. 

We can also compare this to the Russell incident in Canada. There Russell had no cause to brake (SC not ending or other), they were at lower speeds and Russell only decelerated to ca 85 kph so not as hard braking required (Russel 30 psi vs Piastri 60 psi). Russel did not receive a penalty.

Watching the race I thought the penalty was deserved but now I think Oscar got quite unlucky with it.

Edit: I stand by the conclusions I made due to the data but I agree that he shouldn‚Äôt have braked this hard this suddenly given the conditions. But if race control has an issue with him driving this way they should have reacted the first time he did it during the first SC restart. The way it happened he thought he was in the green to do it again","['Please keep the discussion focused on the (technical) details of the incident itself.\n\nFan wars, whataboutism or hatred targeted at any team, driver or official will result in bans.', ""The braking might have seemed reasonable to OP, but to everyone piled up behind him with low visibility it wasn't. \n\nI thought he stopped on track watching it live."", 'It was reckless given the conditions and very deserved. Even Hulk in the cool down room told him how it impacted him and other drivers.', 'Zero question whether he deserved a penalty. 10 seconds can be argued but no penalty at all would have been bullshit, stupid from him\xa0', ""Piastri wasn't thinking about Verstappen at all.\n\nHe was trying to warm up his brakes and tyres. That's all. He just did it in a way that wasn't reasonable. That's all there's is to it.\n\nIt had nothing to do with Verstappen."", 'The fact that the safety car had been called in makes it way worse, and that is what warrants the penalty imo. That is also the reason why Russel did not get a penalty: it was during normal SC period. Not after it has been called in.\n\nThe rule is clear : \n\n"" When the clerk of the course decides it is safe to call in the safety car the message ‚ÄúSAFETY CAR IN THIS LAP‚Äù will be sent to all Competitors using the official messaging system and the car‚Äôs orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the Competitors and drivers that it \r\nwill be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap.\r\nAt this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall \r\nmore than ten (10) car lengths behind it.\r\nIn order to avoid the likelihood of accidents before the safety car returns to the pits, from the \r\npoint at which the lights on the car are turned out drivers must proceed at a pace which involves \r\nno erratic acceleration or braking nor any other manoeuvre which is likely to endanger other \r\ndrivers or impede the restart.""\n\nPiastri was in breached of it. Russell wasn\'t. \n\nPiastri also did it under the rain, and it was a consequent breach. So they went for the harsher penalty. \n\nI honestly completely understand the logic of the steward. And comparing their decision with the Russell one doesn\'t make much sense as it is not the same rule. One if for normal SC conditions, where people are expected to warm up the tyres, and the other is during the actually restart procedures, when drivers are supposed to be lined up and predictable to get back to racing safely.\n\nLike yes it is unlucky for Piastri, but he should have seen the ""SC in pit this lap"" light on time, and eased off instead of keeping doing it.', 'The way the rules are today it‚Äôs a penalty, harsh or not. But I think the FIA needs to look at when they call a safety call in this lap and the drivers should be asking for that. Piastri was reacting to a very late call and as such caused the situation.

Half way down the straight is too late!', '""In order to avoid the likelihood of accidents before the safety car returns to the pits, from the point at which the lights on the car are turned out drivers must proceed at a pace which involves no erratic acceleration or braking nor any other manoeuvre which is likely to endanger other drivers or impede the restart""\n\n55.14 of the sporting regulations.
