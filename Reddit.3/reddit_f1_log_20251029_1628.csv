I want to try some modeling on high-density data. (Ok, to be honest, I want to do high-performance computation on low-level hardware(i.e my laptop) to test how good I can get, but financial data generally isn't available and I don't want to do computer vision/media stuff. I like F1 and think it would be interesting to see how machine learning fares against classical online algorithms for decision-making—plus I want to know exactly how competent the pitwall is compared to a jank-trained machine. I'd assume they're very good, but I want to see for myself.)

I've seen people post sector times and other data, and I've looked at OpenF1 and similar projects, but to the best of my knowledge:

1. There's no information on car setups and internals (like tire temps, body temps—is that even a thing? Does lower temp improve driver performance? At the very least, in Singapore and Qatar the effect of ""bad"" climate is clearly felt)
2. No one has analyzed how close we can get to replicating a pitwall's operations
