I would think the teams themselves are not capable of making replicas of the trophy, especially those that are porcelain, very ornate/elaborate, etc. Is it the trophy manufacturers who provide the replica to the driver? Who requests/pays for the replicas: the teams, the drivers, the FIA? Do the trophy manufacturers make the replicas beforehand in anticipation that some teams keep the trophy so that the replica can be given to the driver?","[""Dependent on contract specifics, but as I understand it the most common arrangement is that the team keeps the original and the drivers have replicas made.\n\nAgain the details of it are not clear, but I'd expect most of the trophy manufacturers will prepare the replicas ahead of time these days because it's so common that the drivers will request a replica."", 'They get made at the same time as the originals. \n\nGenerally, especially with crystal/ porcelain/ breakable trophies, they make 2 of everything, in case there is a breakage before presentation.

1nd9689,Has 2026 Australian GP volunteer registration really closed already?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nd9689/has_2026_australian_gp_volunteer_registration/,2025-09-10, Discussion,"Hey everyone,

I’m a bit confused about the volunteer (marshal/official) registration for the 2026 Formula 1 Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne.

On the Motorsport Australia official website it clearly says: *“Registrations to be a volunteer Race Official at the Formula 1 Australian Grand Prix 2026 are now closed.”*

But here’s the strange part: I can’t find **any announcement anywhere online** (news, forums, social media) that the 2026 registration was ever open in the first place. For the 2024 event, it opened in November 2023, and for the 2025 event it opened in June 2024 — so the timing has been different each year.

Has anyone here seen when the 2026 registrations actually opened? Or is it possible that the wording on the website is misleading, and they just haven’t opened applications yet?

Would love to hear if anyone has more info — thanks!","['Yes, they reached capacity and closed the list a few weeks back. Applications opened in July.

I think the top teams besides McLaren seem to have drivers that are the clear favorite. Russel at Mercedes, Max at Red Bull, Charles in Ferrari. I think you could maybe argue Kimi next year and Hamilton might improve but that’s an interesting if.

Towards the midfield the Williams pair I think are a clear favorite. Albon and Sainz in a battle would be intense. I think it’s clear to say Albon has proved he is good enough to match and beat Carlos, now if in a title battle Albon might fall to pressure more than Carlos? I think that’s a question that still means a fight would go long between the two.

Honorable mentions, Haas I think would have some really interesting veteran versus fast young kid. We will see if 2026 has an underdog story or a top team nailing it or if we’re lucky a close front two teams and a title battle! :)","['I would be thoroughly entertained by a Charles and Lewis inter team battle if we were in a reality where Ferrari was not burdened by itself.

1nd36kq,My Completely Unrealistic 2026 Season Wishlist,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nd36kq/my_completely_unrealistic_2026_season_wishlist/,2025-09-10, Discussion,"This is my list of things I don't see as realistic, but would love to happen, to really kick off the new regulations with a bang. This my first post here y'all so please be gentle lol

1. Both the Aston and the Ferrari are beasts, so I can potentially see one last head-to-head dog fight between Lewis and Fernando. The two drivers that turned me from a casual fan to an F1 diehard, getting the chance at a truly storybook send-off at the top of the sport would be dope
2. Two and Three are connected, but I actually do hope Hadjar gets the ""promotion"" and absolutely kills it. It would be so much fun to watch someone go at it with Max in equal machinery. Max is genuinely one of the most fun and exciting drivers I have seen, and I always felt cheated that Daniel kinda ran from the challenge against him. I think Hadjar is a dog and ROTY, it would be cinema.
3. Because this is a new regulation cycle and all the PUs are brand new, technically, this would be the first year VCARB might actually live up to its ""sister team"" moniker and be on equal footing. If Yuki and Lawson are their drivers, there is a real fun thought experiment that Red Bull can do, the main car can be an aggressive, unhinged monster, while the VCARB can be a more balanced affair on equal PU with no hand-me-downs. Watching them this year has made me excited for the two teams to actually duke it out next year.
4. This is where it goes off the deep end. Both Bottas and/or Checo get podiums at COTA. I think it's cool to have an American works team in the biggest motorsport in the world, and call it bias, but I do think it would be a wonder for the sport for casual American fans to feel they might have a competitive team. I know Haas is also American, but they are, without a doubt, the poorest team in F1, and having Cadillac build an aura similar to the Tifosi would be cool.
5. In my hypothetical 99.99% won't happen dream season, Ferrari and Aston would be fighting out for the WCC. And I pray Williams just comes out of nowhere to beat both McLaren and Mercedes. We have had the same four teams at the top of the pecking order for so long. It would be so refreshing to see a true customer team (I say this just because Williams doesn't make a road car) in the mix. Also, their colors, kits, and drivers just scream Formula 1 to me; they feel Nostalgic!
6. This is a tiny one, but an Ollie/Gabi Podium or win would be dope just coz these two have been so refreshing this season. Ollie has been so impressive; I feel like Ferrari has their driver of the future, and Gabi just has this aggression and feel for the sport that is cool. (This one is definitely just for the vibes)
7. I did the worst math on earth, and the 2026 cars look like they'll be the smallest they have been since 2016/2017, so I'm on my hands and knees begging the universe for more fights. This season has made me feel like all the drivers have been in handcuffs, and I get the feeling they just want to let out. Zandvoort was a pretty good race because a lot of the drivers came back from the break with elbows out

That's it that's the wishlist. I would love to hear everyone's thoughts. I don't think any of these will happen but new season, new regs if this isn't the time for wishful thinking when is.

P.S.: Yes, I am a Ferrari fan, Williams is my midfield team of choice, and watching the king Hulkenberg bring a podium to my favorite backmarker team (I hate kick, Stake and the pickle rick green btw I liled them as Alfa Romeo and Charles is my guy of the current era) brought a tear to my eye.","['From most to least likely I would like:\n\nA) The McLaren driver who doesn’t take this year’s title wins next year\n\nB) Charles finally does it for Ferrari\n\nC) Alonso gets #3 and his spirit can finally rest\n\nD) Cadillac comes out absolutely swinging and Bottas WDC \n\nIf the regs last four seasons then why not all of the above', ""My completely unrealistic wishlist includes:\n\n- A battle for WDC/WCC at the level we've seen in late 2024.

His season this year has been insane.', 'If No1 is true, it would be Alonso vs Leclerc…', ""Charles wins WDC against Max but Lewis must help Charles and have his own 'Lewis is a legend' moment backing up Max as payback for 2021."", '1.  Max vs. Charles title fight with Charles winning WDC and Ferrari taking WCC as well.\n\n\nThat’s it.  That’s the story.', ""Ok, my wishlist :\n\n1.

1ncomu6,Thought experiment with Oscar v Lando,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ncomu6/thought_experiment_with_oscar_v_lando/,2025-09-09, Statistics,"After last weekend, I decided to run a little experiment. It turned out to be more eye-opening than I expected, because I thought it would confirm something I already believed—but instead, it showed me something completely different.

With a little help from AI, I used random number generation to adjust Oscar Piastri’s form to reflect how he performed last year.

Looking back at all of his finishes from 2024, his average was 5.1 with a standard deviation of 3.0. So the idea was to simulate his current season as if he hadn’t improved, using last year’s stats as the baseline. I thought this would create a model where Lando was clearly McLaren’s number one driver.

My assumption going in was that, if Oscar wasn’t consistently near the front, Max Verstappen would be seriously challenging Lando and might be ahead. 

Here’s how I set it up: I left all other drivers’ positions untouched and just dropped Oscar into lower finishing spots based on that statistical profile, promoting the drivers ahead of him. For example, in my model he finished third at Spa instead of winning. There were a few other adjustments like that, but he still only finished outside the points once and even got two wins, which felt realistic.

What I actually ended up with was Lando leading Max by about 70 points. Behind them, there’s roughly a 60-point gap to George Russell, followed by Charles and Oscar close together, about 50 points ahead of Lewis, with Kimi and Alex another 50 points back.

So what I learned is this: Lando has improved drastically this year, even when you assume Oscar’s form stayed at last year’s level.

I’m Australian, so of course I’d love to see Oscar win the whole thing, but I’ll happily say this: Lando is fantastic this year. And unsurprisingly, even in this model, McLaren is running away with the Constructors’ Championship.","['There’s a reason people get degrees in statistics and other fields. \n\nWhat you’ve done is throw darts in the dark to draw a conclusion with no objective meaning. \n\nJust saying “AI” doesn’t make something meaningful or correct.\n\nOf course Lando has been good. He’s one DNF away from being in an extremely close fight for the championship. You don’t need any weird statistical manipulation to tell you that.', '""If you just change everything, everything will appear different""\n\n\n-Will Buxton', ""Maybe im taking it at too simplictic of a level, but how does making Oscar run worse peove Landos improvement?\n\nWhat happens when you run the same stats against Lando comapred to this year?\n\nDid you include McLarens technical inprovements and mid-speed corner dominance into the equation?\n\nI still feel that a drivers biggest push to improve comes from his own team mate's performance and data comparison. If you're cruising over your team mate, and winning against other teams comfortably, there isnt the pressure to find those extra 0.010's."", "">\xa0Lando has improved drastically this year\n\nHow did you conclude that Lando improved and not that McLaren's car did relative to the rest of the field?"", "">Lando has improved drastically this year, even when you assume Oscar’s form stayed at last year’s level.\n\nWhy would you make the assumption that Piastri's form has stayed the same as last year? It has been well-documented -- both by Piastri and by McLaren -- how he has applied himself to address the shortcomings that he had in 2024, and I think you would be hard-pressed to argue that he has not improved as a result."", '""I left all other drivers’ positions untouched and just dropped Oscar into lower finishing spot""\n\n\nSo you arbitrarily made Oscar worse in your game, so Oscar ended up worse. I don\'t want to be too sarcastic but that is hardly surprising.\n\n\nAlso, your conclusion is that Norris improved much? Isn\'t that like killing Batman and concluding Robin is amazing?
