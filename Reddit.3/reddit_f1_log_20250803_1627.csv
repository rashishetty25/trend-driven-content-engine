The leaders doing their pace, trying to create a gap to the midfield to slot in after the first stop. In this case, one Mclaren will try to undercut Leclerc and the other will opt to go longer creating a tyre delta for later. In this scenario it will be very hard for Leclerc to keep the lead. The undercut here is extremly powerful and if they are within 2 seconds before the first stop, one Mclaren will pass him, so Ferrari themselves have to try and be the first to pit.\n\n2. Do a monaco train and keep the field close together, aka driving 1-2 seconds slower than what they normally could do. Therefore the chance of an undercut is reduced a lot since the Mclarens cant slot into some free air. \nWith Leclercs slightly lower downforce setup, the 5 kph top speed adventage could be enough to keep the lead on the two straights but its risky cause with one bad exit of the final corner and mclarens superior traction and grip there he could still be vulnerable and then once he is passed mclaren will drive away and the rest of the race will be hard to recover.
