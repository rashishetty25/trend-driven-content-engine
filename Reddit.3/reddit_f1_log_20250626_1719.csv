It also lets people who have talent but not experience in F1 get used to how to drive an F1 car so when they get to your latest car they are up to speed quickly.\n\nThis is something a lot of the rookies that have come into F1 and done well from the off have had. Hamilton notably had a lot of testing time (might have been current gen back then as well as rules were looser) but Kimi had a lot of miles on previous F1 cars before he ever touched the wheel of a modern Merc.\n\nAlso the engineers can probably draw links between the current car parts and previous and may be able to learn things that are relevant to the current or next gen car."", ""Well they get data which they always love to have, and get to scope out talent.

I'm sure they hoped they had one with Miyata, but he hasn't adapted to F2, which, even though they are very, very different cars, is a large strike against him.\n\nHaas benefitted more directly when Ocon and Bearman also got to drive the car, which has happened. With Ocon changing teams, even driving a 2023 Haas is helpful, especially since it's still in the same regulations. And a little off season test always helps keep the neck strength up too. Driving an F1 car is really the best neck exercise, better than they can do in the gym.

Lots of teams have old cars sitting around, and that doesn't mean they do anything with them.

1ll51c8,[AMuS] Is this step enough for victories?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ll51c8/amus_is_this_step_enough_for_victories/,2025-06-26, News,,"['Translation:\n\n> **Ferrari is under pressure. This makes it all the more important to show its colors on the racetrack. A new underbody is supposed to give the SF-25 a boost. The drivers hope it\'s pointing in the right direction, but doubt it\'ll be enough for McLaren.**\n\n> The unrest in Maranello was hushed up. Not a word about the fact that team principal Frédéric Vasseur and his engineers were being scrutinized, as was rumored in two Italian media outlets before the Canadian GP. Ferrari wants to answer all the doubters on the racetrack. Therefore, the aerodynamic upgrade planned for Silverstone was brought forward by one race to the Austrian GP (June 29).\n\n> The new underbody is intended to help open up the narrow window within which the Ferrari operates. This problem has been troubling Ferrari engineers since the beginning of the season. An initial underbody upgrade in Bahrain brought only minimal improvement. The Ferrari SF-25 remains a car that is difficult to drive at the limit, especially in qualifying.\n\n> According to Charles Leclerc, the third underbody version gives cause for cautious optimism: ""It\'s a significant step. Will it be enough for McLaren? I don\'t think so, because the gap is too big. Several small steps will be necessary."" Lewis Hamilton also expressed caution: ""I don\'t know the exact figures for how much more downforce the new underbody is supposed to provide. We hope it\'s heading in the right direction.""\n\n> **Qualifying weakness at Ferrari.**\nThe next development stage of the Ferrari is scheduled to take place before the summer break, possibly at Spa. This is the mechanical part of the rescue operation. A new rear axle is intended to keep the car\'s ride height more stable within the window where the aerodynamics work.\n\n> The goal is to make better use of the tires in qualifying without having to sacrifice careful tire management in the race. Better starting positions would make things easier for Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton on Sunday. ""It\'s easier for us to manage the tires than to drive at the limit with little fuel. We lose too much time there because we rarely manage to get the tires into their window quickly enough,"" explained Leclerc.\n\n> **Criticism of 2026 cars.**\nWhile the eight-time GP winner is hoping that the second half of the season will be better than the first, he has nothing good to say about the 2026 car. Leclerc has already driven it on the simulator. ""To be honest, it wasn\'t much fun. But we\'re still in the early stages of development.""\n\n> The loss of driving pleasure is more due to the long recuperation phases than to the reduced downforce of the 2026 cars. The FIA, Leclerc said, has the teething issues on its radar. They will certainly make changes if the problem doesn\'t resolve itself with the improvements to the cars.', 'Ferrari is struggling but the Italians make it seem like it’s the apocalypse.

Currently sat in a hot taxi feeling super gutted. We were supposed to go to Maranello tomorrow on the literal trip of a lifetime from NZ which has cost us $8000 to arrange.  Our flight has been canceled so now we can't go and my friend is GUTTED.

We happen to be going to Silverstone on Fri Sat next week. Does anyone know of there's any way I can get pit lane access or anything for her? I want to do something nice to make up for this.

Thank you","[""I don't know if I fully understand your question but yeah there are VIP packages that you can purchase."", 'Dear Ferrari, my friend and his child with terminal cancer (both of them at the same time) and I planned a trip to Maranello and we spent $16,000 (2x what this guy said) and the flight got cancelled.
