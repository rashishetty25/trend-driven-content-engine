Jenson Button said it drove terribly in the first test , but when told he was faster than everyone was shocked', ""I think what you also need to add is that Honda put *all* of their efforts into 2009 during the 2008 season, to the point they were very much ahead of the curve when 09 started.\n\nMoreover, they were able to maximise their results when they had the advantage, which massively disappeared as 2009 evolved and the other teams caught up. There was also a legal battle over the Brawn, which they thankfully won, and they managed to gain enough sponsorship to keep themselves afloat during the year.\n\nI think you've summarised other factors nicely though, so not much more to add on my account."", '* Chassis developed by Honda since 2007\n* Engine developed by Mercedes and given to a customer for the first time\n\nHowever the most impressive thing about Brawn was that, even though they fired a lot of the technical staff and mechanics to keep the operations bare bones, they only had 2 retirements the entire season, fewer than any other team.', 'Double diffuser.

But they were 9th in the WCC in 2008, with only 14 points with only one podium (3rd in GB GP)\n\nIn 2009 I think some things just matched miraculously to allow BrawnGP to happen: they switched to Mercedes engines (arguably better than Honda engines), they risked it all going with the double diffuser (bigger teams didn‚Äôt as they understood it would be illegal and quickly shut down by FIA), and Ross Brawn made magic with some of his decisions, maybe partially because he had more freedom from a Honda that was going out.']",0,13,0.33,0,13,13,0,0,-0.019999999999999962,0

But this is a brave and important piece calling out the obstruction of the press, a trend that I've noticed is rising in motorsport in recent years and exacerbating the erosion of real journalism.\n\nThat PR teams increasingly view the press as something to be censored suggests a failure of two things: properly training their drivers to be able to answer challenging questions, and building relationships with the media that serve both parties.\n\nThis second part is jeopardized when public relations entities control access and narratives to an unreasonable degree, thereby limiting journalists' ability to work ‚Äì\xa0and yes, as Mat's article says, often by speaking on behalf of otherwise cooperative sources.
