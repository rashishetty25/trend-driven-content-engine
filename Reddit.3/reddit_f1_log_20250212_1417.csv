The F1 season currently has 24 races and while most circuits are locked in with multi-year contracts, there appears to be at least one available slot in 2027, with the Dutch Grand Prix to no longer be held after 2026 and the Belgian Grand Prix shifting to a bi-annual rotation.¬† Italy may also lose one of its current Grand Prix races, with the Imola expiring at the end of this season.

Thailand is not the only contender in the bidding race though, with rival submissions expected from organisers in South Africa and Rwanda. Authorities in South Korea and Argentina have also previously expressed interest.

It also hosts an annual MotoGP motorcycle race in Buriram in the east of the country, which generated US$140 million in economic circulation in 2024 and created close to 7,000 job positions at the circuit, according to the tourism authority.

A race in Bangkok would mean two annual races in the region, alongside the Singapore GP, which has been on the calendar in its Marina Bay circuit form since 2008. It was the first night race in the sport‚Äôs history and the first street race in Asia.

B) Going solo - any recommendations for making the most of it?

Some people believe Lando still doesn‚Äôt belong in that group despite taking 8 poles in 2024, which is laughable.

I also believe Bottas, Hulkenberg and Sainz are underrated over one lap. Probably the three drivers just behind the upper echelon. 

Hamilton and Alonso are also in that category, and I feel you could make an argument for Gasly and Ocon too.","['Verstappen and Leclerc. If Verstappen managed to finish his Saudi lap in...2021? 2022?

If it's a race pace car, like the sf24 and the 2022 red bull car  obviously it will be harder to put it on pole. If it's a quali car like the sf90, then it'll be easier to pole but harder to hold on to it. Extreme cars like those always skew quali stats.\nThat being said, Leclerc is the fastest over one lap on his day but Max is  fairly more consistent than him so Max takes this easy.\nNot gonna devote too much attention to the other 2 as it's just laughable that they're brought up at all.

About three times a year they put the car in a position where it should not be.
