The F1 season currently has 24 races and while most circuits are locked in with multi-year contracts, there appears to be at least one available slot in 2027, with the Dutch Grand Prix to no longer be held after 2026 and the Belgian Grand Prix shifting to a bi-annual rotation.  Italy may also lose one of its current Grand Prix races, with the Imola expiring at the end of this season.

Thailand is not the only contender in the bidding race though, with rival submissions expected from organisers in South Africa and Rwanda. Authorities in South Korea and Argentina have also previously expressed interest.

It also hosts an annual MotoGP motorcycle race in Buriram in the east of the country, which generated US$140 million in economic circulation in 2024 and created close to 7,000 job positions at the circuit, according to the tourism authority.

A race in Bangkok would mean two annual races in the region, alongside the Singapore GP, which has been on the calendar in its Marina Bay circuit form since 2008. It was the first night race in the sport’s history and the first street race in Asia.

I’m fairly new to the F1 scene, and I’m incredibly lucky to have amazing in-laws who volunteer each year as part of the recovery crew at the Melbourne Grand Prix. Thanks to them, my husband and I have scored two 4-day GA passes!



Our original plan was to stay in the city and attend all four days together, but due to work, my husband can now only make it on Sunday. That means I’ll be attending most of the event solo - which is a little daunting since it’s my first-ever Grand Prix!



So, I’d love some advice on:

A) Attending your first Grand Prix - any tips or things I should know?

B) Going solo - any recommendations for making the most of it?



I’ve looked through some older posts, but most seem to be from 6-8 years ago, so I’d really appreciate some fresh insights!



Also, any etiquette tips would be amazing - I want to be a good supporter of the sport! 😊 Thanks!",[],1,0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1.0,1

Some people believe Lando still doesn’t belong in that group despite taking 8 poles in 2024, which is laughable.

I also believe Bottas, Hulkenberg and Sainz are underrated over one lap. Probably the three drivers just behind the upper echelon. 

Hamilton and Alonso are also in that category, and I feel you could make an argument for Gasly and Ocon too.","['Verstappen and Leclerc. If Verstappen managed to finish his Saudi lap in...2021? 2022?

If it's a race pace car, like the sf24 and the 2022 red bull car  obviously it will be harder to put it on pole. If it's a quali car like the sf90, then it'll be easier to pole but harder to hold on to it. Extreme cars like those always skew quali stats.\nThat being said, Leclerc is the fastest over one lap on his day but Max is  fairly more consistent than him so Max takes this easy.\nNot gonna devote too much attention to the other 2 as it's just laughable that they're brought up at all. Where was Russell in 2023. When their car was better in race than quali? Just because they beat their teammates doesn't mean they're quali gods."", 'If you look across a season I think Leclerc and Russel have the most extraordinary laps. About three times a year they put the car in a position where it should not be. They also have about two qualifyings where they go out early because of crashes/track limits/a bad day and a few where they place right in the middle of the pack. Hulkenberg falls in a similar mould.\n\nVerstappen has less extraordinary laps in my opinion but his qualifying is nearly always very very good. Norris is similar to Verstappen in my opinion but has a few more average qualifyings (but hardly any bad ones).\n\nIf everyone where to drive a 100 laps I believe Leclerc would post the fastest single lap and Verstappen would have the highest average. \n\nIf I had to choose someone to qualify for me I would take Verstappen because I am practically guaranteed a start in the first two rows.', 'VER and LEC', 'Verstappen is probably more consistent over one lap but I think Leclerc is truly the quickest when he is in the zone. \n\nRussell is also hella underrated when it comes to qualifying', 'For me its charles.
