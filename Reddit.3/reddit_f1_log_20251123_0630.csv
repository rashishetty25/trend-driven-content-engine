The accumulated marbles and grease and gunk that come off road cars are usually washed away by precipitation in a place like, say Miami. Las Vegas gets so little precipitation that the gunk and grease builds up to make roads noticably sloppier in wet conditions. The longer you go between baths, the more disgusting your bathwater is.\n\nLas Vegas is not hot and has little precipitation because it\'s in a desert. To be clear it very much is in a desert but importantly, it\'s in a valley and on the dry side of a major mountain which creates a heat dome and disrupts weather patterns. The predominant mountain that looms over Vegas is Mt. Charleston and is often snowcapped half the year, including right now.\n\nLess than 1 hour away from Vegas is a ski resort on Mt. Charleston and it opened it\'s season this week with 30"" (76cm)+ of fresh snow over the last 3-4 days.

There's some chance they won't be back markers at all by season-end. Maybe I'm delusional though.\n\nThe team I'm primarily worried for next year is VCARB. Red Bull doesn't sound insanely confident about the Ford PU - and that's only gonna be worse for the sister team. If RB ends up 4th-5th in the standings, VCARB could very well turn from best of the midfield cars to complete backmarker.

McLaren: They have give us a close driver battle for a lot of the year, plus the team seems to have absolutely nailed car development considering this is the final year of these regulations. 

Mercedes: They have been fairly consistent throughout the season and I don't recall any major strategy errors. It's this sort of consistency that makes them a powerhouse and kept someone like George Russell in the running for so long.

Red Bull: Outstanding resilience and Max's resurgence has been absolutely incredible to witness. There was of course the huge controversy and turbulence with the Horner fiasco, but the team seems to have moved past it fairly successfully and swiftly.

Ferrari: The team has always tried to do something different and make something of a difficult year. There have obviously been some serious issues, but I respect the team throwing the dice on some strategies. 

Williams: What an amazing demonstration of team evolution and new organisation can achieve! JV should be incredibly proud of what has happened and looks set to continue happening. 

Racing Bulls: Always in the shadow of the bigger sister team, but has been punching way above its weight. The one-lap pace has been awesome and there seems to be a lot of effort behind the scenes to train the newer drivers. 

Aston Martin: I think their investments into new personnel this year will see them have a similar resurgence to Williams in the coming years. They just need to be cut-throat and efficient to make it happen as soon as possible with the new regulations. 

Haas: For a team that is notoriously small and underfunded, they are achieving some excellent results (especially with Bearman) and doing all this with new drivers and personnel has shown how well the organisation is blending behind the scenes. 

Kick Sauber: Another team that has managed to punch above its weight by taking advantage of some chaotic moments and utilising unorthodox strategies. Nico's podium obviously being a standout moment! 

Alpine: After a turbulent start to the year with lots of controversy around driver changes, personnel changes, and what seemed like a lack of cohesion, the French outfit has shown some flashes of brilliance in the second half of the year when they get everything lined up.

I understand there is some history there, but surely it's not less safe than the horrible grip and close walls at Vegas?

In a comparable permanent race facility like Silverstone, we just keep racing in the rain as well.

Why are we so extra cautious in Spa?","[""90% of the time it isn't because of the rain, but because of poor visibility for the medical helicopter. F1 has very prescriptive guidelines regarding this and those affect Spa more than most places because of its location in the Ardennes.\n\nIf weather conditions prevent the medical helicopter from taking off, or landing at the designated hospital, the session cannot proceed.\n\nHappened in Austria a few years ago as well, iirc."", 'The #1 danger in wet conditions isn’t actually the wet track, it’s the lack of visibility. One driver hitting the barriers will be okay 99% of the time, but that same driver being hit by another car who can’t see them is likely to cause major injury, furthermore F1 has strict guidelines surrounding the medical helicopter as it requires good enough conditions to fly and land safely.\n\nIn Vegas today visibility was fine. The rain itself wasn’t all that heavy, and the track wasn’t even all that wet so the spray from the cars wasn’t overly aggressive, it was just super slick tarmac on it’s own which combined with the cold temps turned the track into a skating rink\n\nIn spa when it rains, it’s big thick rain that comes down in buckets, only to get kicked back up into the air by the cars. Watch an onboard from a wet spa race, or any other wet race that has been red flagged and you will see how little the drivers are looking at when following other cars. Spas location in the mountains also means the helis already need to be extra careful, and the wet/colder weather systems often carry in a dense fog that will linger low in the sky making it almost impossible to fly', ""It could have to do with one of the most recent fatalities having happened there. Antoine Hubert died in a crash in an F2 race in 2019 and it's still pretty fresh in people's minds since a lot of the current drivers were coming up the formulas around then.\n\n\n\nHe's the one that Gasly puts flowers out for every year.\n\n\n\nIt may or may not be less safe than other tracks, but if someone dies there again you better believe the officials will go through absolute hell on earth during the followup.\n\n\nIf I were in that seat I'd be that bit more cautious than at Silverstone. I understand it sucks for the fans, but the race director has to live with himself if shit goes down, so I'm not gonna second guess him.\xa0"", ""Visibility is the thing people overlook a lot.\n\nOnce the rain gets pulled up off the track by the tyres and floor into a fine most, the visibility gets very poor very quickly. At a track like Spa with a lot of high speed corners and elevation changes that makes the visibility problem even worse in some sections where the drivers can't see other cars until they're very close."", 'A comment I haven’t seen is that Spa is also the longest lap on the calendar.

It's a lot of rain for Vegas, but the low temperature and it being a street circuit made the wet tire more preferable.

Cheap hotels everywhere, 5 star hotels, 2 amazing airports, great interstate (auto ban) connecting all this. Wide open land that is cheap as hell. Open building laws. Ridiculous low population outside of the cities. Labor 

Look you laugh but you will have more people visit if it was in Nebraska than in Las Vegas. Not because there is stuff do there, Vegas literally has the most stuff to do than any city, but because in Nebraska there is absolutely nothing to do and because of that everything is cheaper.  Yes there is stuff to do there, alot of awesome stuff actually. Chad Kroger of nickel back said that omaha is the coolest place no one has ever been too. That makes it ideal.
