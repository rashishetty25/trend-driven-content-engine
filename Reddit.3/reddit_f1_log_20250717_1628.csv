1m2aa3j,What is your go to racing news site that isn't focused on clickbait or politics?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m2aa3j/what_is_your_go_to_racing_news_site_that_isnt/,2025-07-17, Discussion,"For years I've wanted to keep up with other racing series, but I have very little time to sit down and try to watch dozens of races to figure out who is who, which teams are good, etc. I'm a Dad that coaches for two baseball teams. I have time to read through a news feed (at work), and get to watch most F1 races, but can't watch full races outside of that.

Example: sitting down to watch a full WEC race is just not going to happen for me. They are really good at posting highlights, and the racing+strategy looks great. But, since I have no idea who is involved or strong, or bad, I have no context to whether the guy in the lead is a dominator or a shocker. 

Motorsport used to be a decent resource, but I stopped going there when I had to dig through all the BS, team politics and possibly clickbait articles to get to good stuff. I'm in tune with F1, so when they put something out I have a decent idea whether that article is reasonable. WEC, DTM, Indy... no idea.

So Reddit, how do you reliably keep up with your secondary racing series of choice?","['I keep up with all racing by using Reddit and following official Twitter accounts.', 'For WEC specifically sportscar365 and onlyendurance are great sites.', ""Racingnews365 ofcourse.

I don\'t care about the politics going on, I don\'t care about following the drivers off track. Pretty much anything I could want to know is covered in the pre race build up. I don\'t even stick around for the post race coverage. \n\nI do like watching more technical breakdowns on YouTube but the ""news"" coverage of F1 is too sensationalised for the most part.', ""Usually reddit's first comments are pretty solid clickbait filters\n\nWhy rely on paid actors when actual humans can do it"", 'Similar situation as you.
