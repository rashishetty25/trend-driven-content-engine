1l2efu0,2026 regs probably won’t affect McLaren domination  much,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l2efu0/2026_regs_probably_wont_affect_mclaren_domination/,2025-06-03, Discussion,"Im starting to feel like 2026 might shake the order from P2 to P10, but with McLaren still at the top even after the regulation change. 

The reason: How much revolutionary their brakes are. Tire conservation and the capability of keeping them on the right temperature window will still be key and this is not changing with the new regs. 

We have seen that when the temps are cooler they don’t dominate as much, but in so many circuits the temps are hard to control and they do it so much better than the rest. If other teams don’t find out how to replicate that technology, it’s going to take a much, much faster car to offset that advantage. 

I get that 2009 double-diffuser feeling, but in this case, much harder to copy. 

Thoughts? ","[""People will eventually figure out how McLaren's handling the brakes, and will get it copied sufficiently.

1l32qc7,What is Actually Going on With Lance Stroll?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l32qc7/what_is_actually_going_on_with_lance_stroll/,2025-06-04, Discussion,"**Sure, the official story is probably true... but where’s the fun in that? This is F1 — when has anything ever been that simple?**

The timing of Lance’s withdrawal from the Spanish Grand Prix was *weird*. We're told he’s been dealing with this wrist issue for six weeks, yet he’d already logged several hours in the car over the weekend. So why suddenly pull out right before the race? If it was just discomfort, surely he could’ve pushed through another 90 minutes — drivers (and Lance) have raced through worse.

Plus, the team couldn’t even field the car at all, suggesting the issue is more than just physical pain. That raises a flag, especially when we’ve seen (thanks to *Drive to Survive*) how much Lance was willing to endure just to make the grid after the initial injury.

Now, it looks like he might miss his *home race* — arguably the biggest event for him personally and a huge opportunity for Aston Martin in terms of marketing and merchandise. You’d think he and the team would do *anything* to delay treatment until after that weekend, unless there’s more going on.

And let’s be real: if the issue is serious enough to sideline him with only hours’ notice, there’s no way he’s fully recovered in two weeks.

Then there are those *rumors* — reports of a blow-up in the garage, later denied by team sources. Still, that kind of drama doesn’t fit neatly into an ""injury"" narrative. It starts to feel like something deeper is going on.

So, naturally, the speculation starts:

* Has the team finally run out of patience with Lance?
* Are they quietly testing the waters with potential replacements?
* Is this a face-saving way to move him aside — framed around health rather than performance?
* With Aston Martin targeting the front of the grid in 2026, with a Newey designed car, can they really afford to keep a ""passenger"" in that second seat?

Maybe — just maybe — they're finally getting serious about running a true two-car title challenge.

Thoughts and speculation welcome.","[""None of your speculation makes sense with the timing of the move.
