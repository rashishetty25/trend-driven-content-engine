Absolute shit show.\xa0', 'Papaya rules are now part of the culture and lore.  Zak trying to define the tone and his legacy.', 'So Lando‚Äôs repercussions were that Oscar was allowed one free hit, and he used it up,', ""Everyone's heaping criticism on McLaren but when was the last time two top tier drivers in a championship car actually got along?

1oeu2lc,[RaceFans] F1 considered splitting US TV rights between Netflix and other platforms,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oeu2lc/racefans_f1_considered_splitting_us_tv_rights/,2025-10-24, News,,"['splitting F1 TV rights sounds like an awful idea\n\nwhat you think of when you hear that is ""great! I can choose which platform to watch it on!"" but the reality is that they\'d divvy up the races and make you pay for 5 different platforms to watch the whole season', 'Horrendous deal for fans, just like Premier League in the UK where you need Amazon, Sky and TNT to watch it all legally', 'That‚Äôs how I stopped watching football altogether in Germany. Sky, DAZN, Telekom, Prime, whatever else existed since that started I just chose none instead.', 'Splitting any rights to a sport causes no end of issues and it will result in the decline of the sport. You already see this with football in the U.K. To watch all the games you can, you would need Sky, TNT and Amazon, with Sky and TNT costing at least ¬£18pm each. I cannot remember the last time I watched a European match as I just cannot afford it. \n\nYou need to have young fans watching it, or you will have no fans in the future. The less and less that is available to everyone, means less and less people tuning in.', '""We considered doing the dumbest thing, but in the end we just took the most short term money. It was never about viewers, just the money. See? Everyone wins"".\xa0\n\n\n--F1', ""Splitting the rights 50/50 sounds like it'd be terrible for people trying to follow the sport. Go onto r/NASCAR and see how many people enjoy the Cup Series being spread over two broadcast networks, three cable channels, and Prime Video - especially considering how ratings have sunk this season.\n\nThe only split that makes sense for F1, IMO, is the one frequently made in other countries: the bulk of the races exclusive to a pay platform, but the country's home grand prix at minimum simulcast on a FTA network."", ""Just make F1TV available EVERYWHERE. I'd take a price hike even."", 'They really forget üè¥\u200d‚ò†Ô∏è is an option', 'Why does kid didnt watch our race with 5 different subscription to watch them all ? \n\nDomenicali: race must be too long for those damn kid.', ""As much as I'm not a fan of the Apple TV deal, splitting the broadcast rights would've been an even worse idea.""]",447,141,0.96,447,2323,2323,-3,1,0.0,-3
