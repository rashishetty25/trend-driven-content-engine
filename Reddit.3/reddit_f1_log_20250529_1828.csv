1ky7p64,This is what 'Platinum' actually means for Max Verstappen,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ky7p64/this_is_what_platinum_actually_means_for_max/,2025-05-29, Discussion,"I see a lot of misconceptions about what this 'Platinum' thing means that Max Verstappen has since yesterday, so this is what it actually is.

Platinum is a *rating* from the FIA, it's not a *licence*. As a driver you request to be rated by the FIA, you do not ask to be given a specific rating. The FIA decides what rating you get. It's like a tool or a guide for racing organisations like the SRO (GT World Challenge etc.), so they know where to place this driver into a certain category (like Pro, Pro-Am etc.), depending also on the rating of the driver's teammates.

Being rated by the FIA does not ""bring Verstappen closer to competing in WEC and ELMS"", because it's not a licence. Being Platinum is not a requirement at all to race in those championships nor did Verstappen need to do anything extra to be given a rating apart from just asking for one.

Also, not all F1 drivers are Platinum-rated. As a driver you only ask to be rated, if you intent on doing sports car racing. Only 6 current F1 drivers (including Max) actually have a Platinum-rating: Alonso (WEC champion and Le Mans winner), Colapinto (ELMS race winner and Spa 24H competitor), Norris and Stroll (Rolex 24 at Daytona competitors), and H√ºlkenberg (Le Mans winner). Edit: I didn't wanna forget about Friday drivers Drugovich, Hirakawa and Vesti, who too have a rating.

Alongside the facts listed above, my personal expectation is Verstappen might try and do the KW 6h ADAC Ruhr-Pokal-Rennen, the sixth round of the N√ºrburgring Langstrecken Serie on August 16. He is definitely not doing WEC or ELMS.

Edit: you don't even technically need to ask to be rated, but it is very common to do. As somebody who's been working in the sports car racing industry for a while now, I've seen cases of drivers set to make their debut without having requested to be rated. The FIA will then scramble to find out who this driver is and what their career history is to rate them asap üòÖ","['At risk of pedantry Haas test driver Ryo Hirakawa, who is doing FP1 for them this week, is platinum too', 'I believe after you turn 50 the FIA takes away your platinum status.

We'll reveal what this means in our Grand Prix preview.**\n\n> Many engineers have marked the Spanish Grand Prix in bold on their calendars this year. During the winter break, the FIA \u200b\u200bannounced that all teams would have to prepare for more rigorous front wing testing leading up to the Barcelona weekend. Those who had designed the carbon elements to be too flexible in the past had to retrofit them.\n\n> A flexible front wing, in which the main blade and flaps bend backward, not only reduces drag, resulting in higher top speeds on the straights. The built-in flexibility also helps optimize the setup balance between fast and slow corners.\n\n> In tighter corners, drivers want the front axle to grip the turn. This requires a lot of downforce, which a steeply angled front wing produces. In faster corners, it's more comfortable for the drivers if the rear end doesn't veer off so easily. If the front wing is flatter, the aero balance automatically shifts rearward.\n\n> Since this trick became popular over the past two years, teams have taken increasingly extreme approaches to bending. Development has been increasingly tailored to this. With testing becoming more stringent, engineers now have to put the brakes on. The question is which cars will lose the least performance with the stiffer wings.\n\n> Some teams, including McLaren, predict that the new rules won't significantly change the balance of power from the first eight races. Others, such as Red Bull and Ferrari, hope that the gap to the Papaya cars will be noticeably reduced.\n\n> Barcelona could therefore represent a turning point in the season. The varied track has always been a good indicator for the rest of the year. Those who don't show any weaknesses here will be good anywhere. Many teams are also basing their performance on Barcelona as a factor in how long the development of the 2025 cars will progress.\n\n> The weather isn't expected to cause any additional drama. The latest forecasts call for dry conditions throughout the entire race weekend. Maximum temperatures are expected to only slightly exceed 25¬∞C. A warmer climate would be especially welcome for McLaren. Then they could once again use the tire joker in the race ‚Äì as they did recently in Miami.\n\n> **The track: Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.**\nThe Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya is an ideal benchmark for the cars' performance. Fast corners with high centrifugal forces alternate with medium-speed and slow corners. All-rounders are especially in demand. Those who look good here usually do well on other tracks as well. Because all types of corners are accommodated, an efficient aerodynamic package is required.\n\n> Despite two DRS zones and the more than one-kilometer-long straight, overtaking is traditionally difficult in Barcelona. Qualifying therefore remains crucial. The 600-meter-long sprint into the first corner is one of the longest of the entire season. Here, we often see slipstream battles as the chasing pack chases the man in pole position.\n\n> **Das Setup.**\nBarcelona has been a fixture on the calendar since 1991. The technicians know the track's quirks almost inside and out. The changing winds from the nearby Mediterranean can occasionally throw up surprises. The wings have to be set very steeply at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya to provide sufficient downforce and stability for the fast corner combinations.\n\n> Brake wear is usually not an issue. The engines aren't subjected to excessive strain either. Tires, however, are a regular source of tension in races. As usual, Pirelli brings the very hard compounds C1 to C3. The fast right-hand corners T3 and T9 place particular strain on the left front tire.\n\n> **The Upgrades.**\nAs already mentioned, Barcelona is one of the benchmark tracks in Formula 1. After the wave of upgrades at Imola, we expect to see many new parts on the cars again. Sauber has already announced a larger package. Mercedes also intends to significantly expand its offerings.\n\n> More exciting, however, is the new regulations. Most teams will have to respond to the more stringent endurance tests with reinforced wings. In most cases, the changes will not even be visible from the outside. Mercedes had already conducted test runs in Bahrain and Imola with a stiffer Barcelona wing.\n\n> **The favorites.**\nMcLaren is naturally at the top of the list of favorites again. The high temperatures and above-average tire wear favor Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris. The two Papaya drivers travel to Catalunya separated by just three points. This could cause internal tensions.\n\n> Max Verstappen should be significantly more competitive than he was in Monaco. The fast corners of Barcelona are exactly what the RB21 is looking for. The world champion already showed in Imola that he's ready to take advantage of even the slightest opportunity. Since 2016, only two drivers have won in Barcelona: Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton.\n> Speaking of Hamilton: Barcelona will be Ferrari's last chance to turn things around. The Scuderia must finally get its tire problem under control in qualifying. And the setup window must be larger. In Monaco, they were able to concentrate entirely on the slow corners. In Barcelona, \u200b\u200ball-round qualities will be required again.\n\n> Mercedes also travels to Spain with concerns. Tire wear has been the Silver Arrow's Achilles heel twice this year. If the problem isn't addressed, a Waterloo could occur on the tire-killing track in Barcelona.\n\n> Williams has proven in recent races that while the speed is not enough to get to the front, the car is so consistent that it can score points when the competition is weak.\n\n> Behind them, Toro Rosso, Aston Martin, Haas, and Alpine are also waiting for slip-ups in the tight midfield. Sauber has recently remained well outside the top ten. Fans of the Swiss team will have to hope that the upgrades work."", 'Excitement, excitement aaaand nothing really changes.', 'And after all this anticipation, nothing will change probably', 'Whatever be the outcome, it will still be a 500X more interesting weekend compared to Monaco imo', 'I expect no big change.', 'if somehow aston are the ones most affected by this change as in 2023 and they are the 9th-10th team again I will fucking riot', '100% I am ready to be hurt again.', 'Getting excited for this weekend.']",153,86,0.93,153,82,82,-3,2,-0.009999999999999898,-3

1kxo32d,Madrid track layout,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kxo32d/madrid_track_layout/,2025-05-28, Discussion,"So I just saw a layout of the 2026 Spanish Grand Prix in Madrid and it‚Äôs getting a lot of hate for the amount of turns and comments about it being yet another track that isn‚Äôt conducive to overtakes. I‚Äôve also heard grumbling of how many of the tracks on the current schedule (see Monaco) are similar in difficulty to perform overtakes. 

My question is: what aspect of track design lends to more overtakes? And why are many of these circuits being built this way? Is it more of an issue with the design or is it just how large the modern F1 car is, or a mix of both? You‚Äôd think these race organizers would want uh, you know, actually racing instead of a parade of cars (see Monaco again.)

Also, what is in fact the best track for overtaking? ","['Take silverstone, interlagos or cota as examples of good tracks for racing.\n\nTake Hungaro mexico or Sochi to see what‚Äôs not good for racing\n\nThen there‚Äôs a middle ground of tracks like Spa or Monza that used to be good for racing but are ruined by DRS trains and dirty air\n\nFor an overtaking chance to occur in modern f1 you need a straight that‚Äôs not preceded by a slow twisty section and that ends in a heavy braking zone\n\nThe madrid track is an abomination from any point of view', ""I would argue that Bahrain, Interlagos, Las Vegas, Canada and Mexico are the best for overtaking right now. \n\nGenerally F1 cars need a long straight followed by a heavy braking zone to encourage overtaking, with the emphasis on heavy braking. \n\nLots of sequential corners and a narrow track make overtaking difficult. Imola is difficult because it's a lot of medium speed corners with no straights long enough to create overlap. Monaco is difficult because it's narrow and there's basically no straights to create braking events big enough to pass. \n\nJapan was difficult because the dirty air made it hard to be close enough at the beginning of the long straights, and turn 1 isn't a big enough braking event to allow for overtakes. I was surprised there weren't more opportunities at the Casio Triangle but I think 130r makes that hard. \n\nI think a lot of people would argue with me on Mexico being good for overtakes but I think the thin air creates and interesting balance where you get Monza-like downforce levels while trying to add on as much downforce as possible. The first two sequences of corners I feel create decent opportunities for pass attempts."", 'You need a high-speed straight ending in a heavy braking zone, followed by a low speed corner, with decent track width. Lose any one of those and you lose overtaking. Turn 1 at Baku is an overtaking dream. Turn 1 at Hungaroring is more difficult. Track width is there, but the front straight is on the shorter end, and the turn is a wide radius low-medium speed corner. You can get an overtake done, but it isn‚Äôt easy. Turn 1 at Monaco is a nice 90 degree-ish right hander, but the straight is too short, speeds are too low, and the track is too narrow.', ""I'm looking forward to it and interested in it, Vegas also got a lot of hate but it's been one of the better races last couple of years, I am sure that they built the track with the current cars in mind so i wouldn't be too worried tbh."", ""Long straights followed by hard braking zones is the usual recipe for modern F1. There are a few who have enough track width to support multi line racing through several corners (silverstone for example, Hungaroring kind of...) but it's mostly hard braking zones."", ""Actual race tracks are conducive to overtaking. When you have more runoff the more you're going to push the car to do things that you may not normally do. All these street tracks do is promote a fucking parade"", ""I find people always preemptively moan about new tracks, I think a lot of people don't like change. What is true is that there is a conflict between a push for more city tracks and the fact that city tracks will inevitably be more limited in what they can do than purpose built tracks because they're tied to the existing road layout and buildings. \n\nThe reason that they want more city tracks is that it brings the races closer to people and can involve better visuals, more prestige etc than some circuit out in the middle of nowhere.\n\nHowever we've seen plenty of great races at city tracks from Vegas to Singapore, and plenty of purpose built tracks that often produce poor racing, from Barcelona to Hungary.\n\nUltimately they do their best within the limitations and there are plenty of city tracks that produce good racing and sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't.   \n  \nI'd never judge a track just by a map so I'll reserve judgement on Madrid. There are things you can look out for, long straights followed by heavy braking zones and switch backs are generally good, sequences of medium to high speed corners generally aren't. But track width, kerbs, run off, bumps, tarmac abrasiveness and so many other factors all come into play so you really need to see the track in action before making a clear judgement."", ""Speaking of Madrid, has anybody found/done a Sim lap video on AC or similar that's better than the god awful hot lap in the announcement yet?"", 'Google Hermann Tilke.

It would be almost like a more extreme version of calling Hulk back. It could be like if Massa retired after his 2009 crash, ended up racing elsewhere, but then came back in like 2017 to mentor Stroll because Papa Stroll wanted Lance to have a mentor.

Pitt could totally play a 40 something. After factoring in the never won a race thing, maybe he's not actually that old? Maybe he had barely started his F1 career and was like 23 in 1999? He could maybe barely be late 40s now? Though I'm not sure why someone who barely had an F1 career twenty five years ago would be the ideal candidate for an F1 rookie.""]",0,14,0.42,0,64,64,0,0,0.0,0

This is probably fair- Haas had some dismal years from Bad Santa to Mazepin, and Williams during Claire's last years was in a sorry state.  

However, looking at Sauber's F1 results since *2008*, when they placed 3rd in the WCC, they've been quietly and consistently bad. Sauber has managed to place higher than 7th in only three seasons: 

2009: 6th 

2012: 6th 

2022: 6th  

Unlike both Williams and Haas, which are on an upward trajectory, Sauber seems to only be getting worse. So where is the uproar over their poor performance? Does Sauber not have a dedicated fanbase like the other teams?  

Wondering if some real F1 veterans can enlighten me on this one.

When they were given the time of the day, when they became the BMW factory team, they did deliver as well as they could. As for their current stint... well, they got shafted when they became Ferrari's C-Team, with Ferrari seemingly more interested in developing Haas than investing in them. And now they're in a holding pattern for Audi, not even bothering to recover from the Alfa Romeo stint cause, why spend the money when Audi can spend theirs?"", ""I feel like Sauber gets dragged for it all the time, but in the last few years, it's been understandable. They've been in the process of selling to Audi for a few years, and it's also the last few years of the regulations. It doesn't really make sense for Sauber (team now owned by Audi) to put a lot of money into making a good car when they are about to finally be under the Audi name, and want to spend all possible money towards making 2026 and the future as good as possible.\n\nProbably they'll get a pass at first in the new regulations because they have a first time engine manufacturer, so we might assume it's that if they struggle.\n\nFrankly, they aren't that far off the pace. All the drivers and all the cars are so good. Usually everyone is within a second in qualifying, and that definitely hasn't always been the case in F1. Honestly sometimes F1 qualifying is tighter in times than professional spec series qualifying, even when we all know that there's a general pattern that the better drivers are at the better teams, with some exceptions for most teams having a number one and number two driver, and some drivers not fitting in the driver market. With that taken into account, it's crazy how tight the whole F1 grid is. Sauber doesn't always have both cars out in Q1. They are bad, but there is usually a team this bad or worse. Hulkenburg getting some points in the first race by surviving and taking advantage of the weather took some pressure off them so they don't have to worry about having a pointless season."", 'You can say ""shit"", eh?']",0,83,0.41,0,465,465,0,0,0.0,0
