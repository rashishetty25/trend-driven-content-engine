But the Qatar track has no character whatsoever, I've never been able to discern the layout as it all looks exactly the same. It is a sea of flat tarmac, floodlights, and high-speed corners going into medium-speed corners. No identifiable corners, no landmarks for reference. 

Miami, a fairly universally disliked track, has distinct parts and buildings like the stadium and intersection for reference, so you can tell where in the track the rivers are. Bahrain, a similarly situated track with a barrage of floodlights in the middle of a desert, has the large tower by the first corner and goes up & down a hill for some kind of reference point. China has the gigantic pit building great first corner complex and a thrilling final few corners. Abu Dhabi, known for it's lack of character, is fairly nicely split into thirds with the high speed first sector, double-straight, and 90° corners galore.

Is this just me? Are there any other tracks that have a distinct lack of character that I am missing?

Obviously, Pulling and Pin would probably survive in a higher series or an open one in general, given that pulling does have some experience in British F4 and Pin even managed a podium in WEC which is quite impressive, but what about the rest of the grid? I'm assuming the ones with no points would probably also flounder in F4 regional, but do the top 5 or top 10 have a good shot at podiums in weaker f4 regionals, or even F3/F2 for drivers such as pulling and pin.

Furthermore, how do they stack up to actual F1/F2 drivers. Does someone like Bianca Bustamante actually have the skill to backup mocking actual f1 drivers like Lance Stroll, or would Lance Stroll in a wig lap every single f1 academy driver comfortably without breaking a sweat in equivalent machinery over a full grand prix length. Would a talented F3 rookie, like Piastri in his F3 years be able to smoke the girls even?

","[""The whole point of F1A at this point in time is exposure. They're the trailblazers at this point. I don't think anyone expects any driver on the current grid to be making it to F2 or F1. The powers that be want little girls around the world to be dreaming about becoming race drivers. The female talent pool is simply too small at this point. The more girls we have interested in racing the better and hopefully the number of girls driving go karts goes up at the grassroots level."", ""Based on Marta García, who won F1 Academy last year.

So none of them have any decent chance to get to F1, F3 maybe someone could reach but I think F2 is still too far away.

Also freca scored points but only finished 17 behind drivers that only copeted in half the races.\n\nThere is a reason why F1a exists and that is why i do not agree with Flörsch at all that they should just compete in the normal ONLY.

For instance, not many would have known about Ayrton Senna\'s beautiful friendship with Keith Sutton, had the latter not come out to shed light on it recently.\nAlthough Sutton never made it to the pinnacle of motorsports, he too, vied for a career in racing at the same time as Senna. Senna became successful, whereas Sutton started working as the Sao-Paolo native\'s personal photographer for a short period of time when he was in the lower ranks of open wheel racing (between 1981 and 1984).\nSenna first met Sutton when he took some pictures of him in his junior Formula car. Impressed, he asked Sutton to join his team and the two began working together, resulting in many prominent personalities getting to know the Brazilian driver, thanks to the clicks.\nEventually, Senna would meet the right people who would help accelerate his F1 dream, which not only did he realize, but also conquered. By winning three World Championships, he became one of the best and most beloved drivers of all time.\nSutton\'s role in shaping his career won\'t be forgotten and his time with Senna will be immortalized in the upcoming Netflix miniseries about the late great legend.\nSutton took to his own Instagram account to share his feelings about their friendship before the premiere. He wrote, ""Working closely with Ayrton during the early years of his racing career remains one of the most special periods of my life. Capturing the moments of a legend in the making was an honor I\'ll never forget.""', 'It was a B-minus for me! \n\nPositives: cinematography, cast (Prost’s perm was chef’s kiss)\n\nNegatives: too much drama with Senna-Prost and Senna-FIA', 'The racing scenes were pretty repetitive and so were the Brazilian celebration scenes at the end of some episodes.  Also feel like some of sennas mannerisms weren’t portrayed that accurately.
