1i0hqd2,What are some races where an unlikely car/driver almost won the race but said possibility was forgotten by the general public?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i0hqd2/what_are_some_races_where_an_unlikely_cardriver/,2025-01-13, Discussion,"F1 isn't a stranger to unlikely race winners nor the unlikely cars/drivers that ""almost"" won a race. Most recently, Esteban Ocon in last year's Sao Paulo GP took advantage of the red flag and led until the 2nd safety car restart where Max Verstappen overtook him en route to a famous victory. 

However, I recently rewatched the 2012 Italian GP, a race most famous for Lewis Hamilton's final pole-to-win with McLaren and Fernando Alonso's podium extending his championship lead to 37 points, including 39 points over Sebastian Vettel who retired in the closing stages. What also stood out was Sergio Perez, who ran an off-set strategy by starting on the hards, finished 2nd and just 4.4 seconds off the lead despite starting from 12th and had a great chance at challenging for the win if he qualified well enough (his teammate Kamui Kobayashi qualified and started from 8th).

This drive by Perez in Monza is certainly much less remembered than Perez's drive in Malaysia the same season where in changing conditions he rapidly closed down on Fernando Alonso, cutting the lead to 0.5 seconds and eventually finishing a memorable 2nd place, with just 2.3 seconds off the lead.

So like this, what are some races where an unlikely car/driver almost won the race but said possibility was forgotten by the general public? Certainly cases like Alonso in Monaco 2023 or Norris in Russia 2021 are quite well remembered for example, so what are the cases that are forgotten?","['Canada 98: Fisichella lead almost a third of the race until Schumacher activated the schumacher mode and caught up a stop and go to take back the lead.\n\nTrulli in Austria 97: Lead half of the race in a fucking Prost and was catching Villeneuve again to get back the lead when his engine gave up.', 'Andrea de Cesaris almost won the Belgian Grand Prix *twice*.\n\nFirst in 1983 for Alfa Romeo, after he made a lightning start to take the lead and looked quite comfortable out front.

He was a bit overshadowed by his teammate for that race - a certain young chap called Michael Schumacher - but after Schumacher retired he drove a very strong race and was closing on leader Ayrton Senna when his engine blew due to a lack of lubricant.\n\nBruno Giacomelli also almost won for Alfa Romeo at the 1980 US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen.

1i1390j,Jordan's 2000 Season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i1390j/jordans_2000_season/,2025-01-14, Discussion,"I'm rewatching the 2000 season at the moment and Jordan's season has peaked my interest. After the heroics of 1999, where the team was punching well above it's weight, Jordan set out to solidify themselves as a top team in 2000. They signed fast Jarno Trulli to replace the demotivated (and retiring) Hill and it was expected that both Jordans could fight at the sharp end of the field. 
In reality, we know how it went. Jordan had a hugely disappointing season, even failing to clinch third in the constructor's championship. This led to the competition with BAR over the factory Honda engines in 2001, putting the team under additional pressure. Jordan declined each year, became a proper backmarker by 2004 and Eddie sold the team. 

But rewatching the 2000 season, Jordan's year is remembered far worse than it was, focusing on pace alone. The Jordan was, over the balance of the season, the third fastest car slightly ahead of the Williams. It achieved front row starts and was a regular top 6 qualifier. Jordan had several races where they ran up front just behind the McLaren's and Ferrari's, on some occasions even splitting them (Australia after both McLaren's retired, Monaco where Trulli ran in P2 for the first half of the race). They were semi-regularly on course for additional podium finishes (both in Australia, Frentzen in Great Britain, Trulli in Monaco, Trulli in Germany and Belgium). Pace-wise the EJ10 (and its B-Spec) wasn't much worse than the 199 from the previous year. 

But it was woefully unreliable. The Jordans finished only 15 out of a possible 34 times and more often than not, they retired in points-paying, sometimes even podium positions. This helped Williams, who were a tad slower overall but much more reliable to achieve third in the constructor's. I personally think if Jordan sacrificed just a bit of speed for more reliability, the car still would have been fast enough to clinch third in the constructor's with something around 40-45 points. They still wouldn't have solidified themselves as a top team, but the outlook for 2001 and beyond would have been much better. Clearly ahead of BAR, no direct competition with them for the Honda works engines, more resources to focus on fine tuning the package.

In a way I think the 2000 season shaped the future and eventual downfall of Jordan. I'd like to know the opinions of others on this. Would a better 2000 have helped Jordan to stay afloat much longer?

Tl;dr Would a more reliable car in 2000 that would have got third in the constructor's have helped Jordan longer term to stay in F1 for longer?","[""I don't think it would have made much of a difference in terms of longevity. This was the era where privateers were basically being priced out as manufacturers flooded in. Best case for them is that Honda stays with them and dumps BAR which means they get bought by Honda in 2005 instead."", ""Jordan were unlucky that season in that they lost a lot of points through no fault of their own and they were disproportionately hit by reliability issues when they were on course for strong results. However, they did also lose a fair few points through driver error. Frentzen putting it in the wall from P2 in Monaco with a handful of laps left and causing the huge pile-up at Monza in a race they'd have been well set to score in are the two biggest examples.\n\nTo answer the second part of your question, I don't think it would've made much difference if they'd had a better 2000. They were getting leapfrogged by Williams in 2001 in any case and while they arguably should've beaten Sauber to fourth that year, they just didn't have the resources to take on the manufacturers. Performance wasn't a factor in Honda choosing BAR over them either since Jordan actually finished ahead of them in 2001 and 2002 and I doubt marginally better results would have changed much."", ""I think it certainly would've helped, because they are a case study in how rapidly F1 can become untangled for a team. Eric Boullier described similar for Lotus in 2014, that when things go poorly the drivers want to leave, the engineers and designers get poached, the good staff look elsewhere, the sponsors get unsure.\n\nHe's said since that McLaren sincerely faced that mid 2017.\n\nLiterally everything starts to unravel very quickly and synergistically.\n\nTrulli was probably my favourite driver in that era (beyond McLaren). I still have a 2001 Jordan hat! It's lasted better than some far newer team wear.\n\nI think Trulli is an absolutely perfect case study in the phenomenon of:\n\n1. driver is seen as poor (HHF)\n\n2. goes to team where he is clear #1 and surprises\n\n3. new driver comes in and grounds him immediately. \n\nIt's unreal how different reliability is now and I appreciate it's perhaps less interesting as a result. Marc Priestley said once that, long-term, the push towards multi-weekend components has meant the cars are fundamentally more endurance cars without a hat, rather than ~2001 where every component was 100% from start to finish, and therefore on the verge of exploding at any moment. Ferrari with a qualifying engine that lasted 12 laps etc.\n\nI sometimes think of how F1 is life on fast forward, that Jordan sort of ate his principles to sack HHF before his home GP, to get Honda engines which might keep the entire team afloat.\n\nThey've said on BBV10s once or twice that an enormous 'what if' is Hill going to Jordan for 1997 where he very probably would've won at least one race."", 'I always wonder how much of the team remains over name and organization changes, are there still people working in the Aston Martin team right now that were part of the team when it was named Jordan?\n\nI remember for example how commentators were saying how happy everyone was when Toro Rosso got their first win, and it was in large part because of how beloved Minardi was and that there was a big feeling that they really deserved a success like that. That was years after the transition from Minardi to Toro Rosso.', 'Yeah in 2000 we had Jordan, Prost, Minardi, Benetton, McLaren, Arrows, Sauber and Williams all on the grid as largely privately owned, self funding teams.\n\n\nOver the next few years most of them were gone (Arrows, Prost), de facto works teams (Renault, McLaren Mercedes, BMW Sauber), bought by billionaires as a plaything (Minardi, Jordan).\n\n\nWilliams were the only ones who stayed on as privateers. It was a extraordinarily difficult time to be running an F1 team.', ""All those big manufacturers coming into F1 certainly was a major contributing factor in Jordan's demise. Do you think a better 2000 would have enabled Jordan to at least remain a solid midfield team until they would be eventually bought out? Or could you imagine a Sauber-Like scenario where they would be bought by e.g. Honda and when Honda pulls out in 2008/2009 they would revert back to Jordan?"", 'Yeah, I found it really interesting  how quickly the narrative shifted from ""Jordan want to establish themselves as a top team and go for the championship at least as a dark horse"" in 2000 pre-season to fighting for survival relatively shortly after. Add in the Vodafone sponsor fiasco 2001/2002 and you have the recipe for a sharp decline.', '>I think Trulli is an absolutely perfect case study in the phenomenon of:\n\n>1.\t\u2060driver is seen as poor (HHF)\n\n>2.\t\u2060goes to team where he is clear #1 and surprises\n\n>3.\t\u2060new driver comes in and grounds him immediately.\n\nTrulli didn‚Äôt ground Frentzen immediately. Frentzen pretty easily had the measure of Trulli in 2000, out scoring him 11-6 despite having 9 mechanical failures to Trulli‚Äôs 3. It was only 2001 where Trulli got the upper hand over Frentzen.', 'Yeah I do miss the excitement of the days when any given car had almost a 50:50 change of spontaneously blowing a head gasket or throwing a conrod.\n\n\nI get why they brought in limited part counts for a season, it was an unfair advantage for teams like Ferrari who could afford to blow through six engines a weekend. But in the cost cap era it might be time to revisit that and shift the balance more towards pushing the limits again']",30,18,0.86,30,15,15,5,1,0.020000000000000018,5
