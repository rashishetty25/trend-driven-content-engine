Are they going to be similar to 2025 ones in terms of degradation or will we see something closer to early 2010s tyres to increase overtakes and strategy options?

What we know is that Pirelli aim for a conservative construction and a larger pace difference between compounds (target is 7-8 tenths up from 5) to cover a wider range of potential car performance.\n\nHow these tyres will turn out to work is nothing that can easily be predicted. We will have to wait and see on that.', ""Mostly the same tires really\n\nAlso worth pointing out, these regulations haven't failed despite public opinion, they're still some of the closest racing we've had in the entire history\n\nYes we will see an increase again  \nGive it a couple of years though and in 3-4 years time they will be worse than what we had this season"", ""we're drawing a unknown, there have been discussions about mandatory 2 stop races, and as gor tha last bit, all of this isnt Liberty Media's are of experties, lol, its the FIA.

I want your guys' opinion on how much success we will have next year. Historically, first-year works teams have done quite poorly, but I think there are too many experienced and talented people for this to be a complete flop. My prediction is it will take until the fourth round, at Bahrain, but those more knowledgeable than me I'm sure can give me a reality check. Obviously this is all hypothetical, and nobody really has any idea what will happen, but I like thinking about it anyway. I was gonna wait until near the start of the season for this post, but with all the hype surrounding Audi and the early launch this week, I thought I'd do it now.
