Spa has the most beautiful scenery for any GP you could ever visit. However, Spa has the worst overall experience you could have at any GP.\n\nThere's the issue with getting there, parking, going to the circuit. It taking 45 minutes to an hour to get out of your car and walking to the circuit on badly managed roads is already bad. But imagine when it's raining, you're standing in the middle of a patch of farmland which you need to pay 30 euro for (if you're lucky), sogging away into the grass. Then walking to the circuit over a mud-ridden road. Coming to the circuit there are way too few entrance points, so the crowd takes a long time to enter the circuit. The experience greatly varies (as with all GP's) whether you have gold, silver or bronze tickets. Food and drink prices are crazy, on some spots on the circuit it's a long walk to either a food or drink vendor and there's thousand of people pissing all over the place because of toilets being either too far away or way overcrowded. \n\nYes, Spa is the most beautiful race you will ever visit with it's nature and track scenery. The sound of the engines (today much less so than the 90's and 00's) roaring between hills of the Ardennes forest is A-MA-ZING. But you better come prepared. Take a decent raincoat with you, prepare for +25 and +5 temperatures with your clothes. Be aware that the sun can be very bright and you'll burn easily. Prepare to walk, A LOT. And if you want to leave the circuit, just wait, wait until almost everyone is gone. Because if you're parked more closely to the entrance of the circuit, you'll probably have to wait at least 5 hours before you can leave with all the traffic going out at only one spot.\n\nReason I'm writing this up is because the news that the track is making a loss doesn't surprise me. Spa has done very little the past 3 decades to make the track more appealing in terms of accessibility, entertainment, modernization. It very much is a relic at this point, but of course it should still be on the race calendar. But where tracks like Silverstone and Barcelona have had upgrades in terms of the fan-experience, Spa has done very little, at least imo. \n\nDoesn't mean we're not going to go each year it's on the calendar of course, it's only a 3 hour drive and with my dad's age you never know which year you're going together for the last time."", 'Spa needs to really look at why it‚Äôs losing money. I‚Äôve been to Spa, and when you compare it to Silverstone (which turns a profit) there‚Äôs a few key differences:\n\n1. They do not charge enough for certain seats. I sat at Eau Rouge - Gold 3 - and trust me when I say it‚Äôs one of the best seats on the calendar, looking down the hill and some of the most on the limit driving happening in front of you. It‚Äôs a covered grandstand with its own toilets underneath which you can only get into if you have tickets, with its own food outlets underneath. This is a luxury in european F1 terms. Charge more for this and similar stands - they are worth it because they‚Äôre more luxury than anything aside from hospitality at Silverstone. GA? No, don‚Äôt increase that. But Gold 3, Gold 2, Gold 8? Up that price.\n2. They make it incredibly hard to spend money. Why do I have to buy a card, go pay to top it up, and then your range of food I can buy with it is basically fries, terrible nachos, and crap burgers? They had me taking tupperware down to hotel breakfast to pack my lunch because it‚Äôs not worth it. Something Silverstone does really well is turning the place into a festival feel, there‚Äôs a variety of food stands and not having this card shit made it super easy for me to go and impulse buy a korean corn dog, or gyros, or a massive belgian waffle, and Silverstone got a cut of those profits. What‚Äôs easier to buy - a load of cheesy chips for ¬£6 where I can just use my phone contactless, or a load of cheesy chips for 3.7 spa coins where I have no clue what that is in real money and have to go find a stall to top it up.\n3. They don‚Äôt seem to understand how to manage the fan stage. They have almost all the driver interviews in a single day, with everyone packed in there, and then nothing. So that central area with the most food stalls and merch stalls is very full at one point and then basically empty and not making money. Silverstone spreads the interviews through the weekend, so people are repeatedly drawn to the biggest money making zone of the track.\n4. Their extras are a bit shit. When I went you had the option to request a ‚ÄòVIP lunchbox‚Äô but it was a bit of crudit√©s and cheese. Nobody can be arsed with that in the pissing rain and definitely not for ‚Ç¨50.\n5. Blocking routes for people with Bronze tickets is shit and inconvenient. It makes people with bronze tickets not feel like coming again, rather than making them think ‚Äòfuck, I loved Spa, maybe I‚Äôll go for a Grandstand next year‚Äô.\n\nSpa is excellent. The racing is good, the fans are friendly, and the staff work really hard - it‚Äôs incredibly clean, they‚Äôre friendly, they‚Äôre a credit to the track.

1i0hqd2,What are some races where an unlikely car/driver almost won the race but said possibility was forgotten by the general public?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i0hqd2/what_are_some_races_where_an_unlikely_cardriver/,2025-01-13, Discussion,"F1 isn't a stranger to unlikely race winners nor the unlikely cars/drivers that ""almost"" won a race. Most recently, Esteban Ocon in last year's Sao Paulo GP took advantage of the red flag and led until the 2nd safety car restart where Max Verstappen overtook him en route to a famous victory. 

However, I recently rewatched the 2012 Italian GP, a race most famous for Lewis Hamilton's final pole-to-win with McLaren and Fernando Alonso's podium extending his championship lead to 37 points, including 39 points over Sebastian Vettel who retired in the closing stages. What also stood out was Sergio Perez, who ran an off-set strategy by starting on the hards, finished 2nd and just 4.4 seconds off the lead despite starting from 12th and had a great chance at challenging for the win if he qualified well enough (his teammate Kamui Kobayashi qualified and started from 8th).

This drive by Perez in Monza is certainly much less remembered than Perez's drive in Malaysia the same season where in changing conditions he rapidly closed down on Fernando Alonso, cutting the lead to 0.5 seconds and eventually finishing a memorable 2nd place, with just 2.3 seconds off the lead.

So like this, what are some races where an unlikely car/driver almost won the race but said possibility was forgotten by the general public?

&#x200B;

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

&#x200B;

GOOD LUCK AND MAY THE TRASH TALK BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOUR.
