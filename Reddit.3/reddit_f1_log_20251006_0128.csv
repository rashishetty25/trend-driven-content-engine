It made me think about what this actually means for racing.

2026 F1 cars will have a 9 MJ battery powering a 350 kW electric motor, but the battery can’t be fully recharged every lap even with all the energy recovered during braking.

Even top tracks with strong braking zones only give back about 7-8 MJ to the battery, less than what the 9 MJ pack needs. Drivers can’t rely on using maximum electric power all the time without draining the battery.

On long straights, the battery drains quickly and regen can’t keep up. Teams will have to manage energy carefully and save electric power for key parts of the lap instead of using it continuously.

This limitation makes the new hybrid systems more strategic in racing, when and how you use electric power could decide battles and lap times.

Will this energy management create more strategy and uncertainty, or just become standard race management?","['Even as it is, it takes a lap to build up to have a shot at overtaking every 2nd lap. This will make it every 3rd.', ""They obviously won't deploy maximum power all the time and will have to get used to managing when they want to use all the power they have and when they don't.   \n\nOne thing that interests me more is if the massive amount of electric torque available now makes the motor mapping a sort of back-door traction control, or if the FIA has already thought around it."", 'Drivers will need to relearn how to drive with this PU regulation.\n\nNo more full throttle all the time, instead they’ll have to manage power across an entire lap to get it right. In a way it will be interesting to see who can adjust best to this new reg change.', ""It'll be like Top Gear. Where you have to save the nitro boost for the best parts of the track."", 'they will be using the mgu-k to generate on throttle too - possibly out of corners for TC of sorts but mostly towards the end of straights like the mgu-h does already - some tracks they will definitely not have enough fuel to do this every lap though.', 'there will probably be a lot of clipping', 'It means using the battery to defend will only work on 1 lap, which tbh will make the racing much better. Overtakes will take a little more strategy, but now if you are quicker you will be able to overtake on pure power on a straight instead of getting stuck behind someone using the battery on every straight', 'Not sure I understand this correctly, but the battery delta SOC should be 4MJ whilst the energy recovery limit is at most 9MJ, usually 8.5MJ.\n\nIt could indeed be challenging to recover enough energy under braking, they will likely burn some fuel for that as well. There are also a number of regulatory deployment limitations to manage the battery around the lap. things like limits to how much power they can deploy at what speeds, how fast they can reduce that power and how much they can recharge under full throttle.', 'In theory it will be a fun variable to the racing.

1nyz4cu,George Russell redemptions arcs in Singapore 2025 and Canada 2025. Do you think it shows how much more has he improved as a driver?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nyz4cu/george_russell_redemptions_arcs_in_singapore_2025/,2025-10-05, Discussion,"Just wanted to share an appreciasion post and start a discussion about George Russell, because I don't think many people notice how much he has matured and improved as a driver over the course of the last 18 months.

Singapore 2025:

After 2 years it seems like George Russell finally got rid of his ""last lap curse"".
2023 - Russell crashed on the last lap from P3
2024 - George drove into the wall in FP2, then finished the race in P4, suffering from heatstroke afterwards.
2025 - inserted himself into the wall once again in FP2. Got pole position with one of his best quali runs imo. Then executed flawless and dominant drive to win.

Canada 2025

2024: He got amazing pole position with the same time as Max. Beacuse of some mistake didn't capitalize on it fully and finished P3
2025: Got Pole position second time. Drove dominant race and finished P1.

In summary, in contrary to what many says Russell proves once again that he is able to analize his mistakes, learn from them and don't allow failures to get to his head too much.

Another telling thing is that after both Canada 2025 and Singapour 2025 he said sth like ""It is a payback for ...."" so these failures must have meant a lot to him 

I will probably get downvoted for this but I think that George this years can handle pressure very well ( better than Norris, Charles  and maybe even Oscar) especially in quali. Yesterday was not the first time that he wasn't super competetive in Q1 and Q2 but when it matters he got his shit together and got pole after 1st lap. Looking back this is a recurring pattern with him.","['Not sure how many podiums and poles he got last year but he’s defintely done well this year in a car that isn’t as good as McLaren’s.', 'What\'s funny is Leclerc and Russell have swapped places this and last season.\n\nRussell in 2025 and Leclerc in 2024 = uber consistent in a decent car to maximize podiums, rightfully receives a lot of praise\n\nLeclerc in 2025 and Russell in 2024 = in a less competitive car or team and so people think they\'re bad due to less podiums\n\nEdit: to be clear I rate them both very highly. Russell last season deserved far more praise than he got, my point is that people are acting like Leclerc suddenly got worse or Russell randomly became a top 3 driver this season when their performance has been pretty much the same across both. \n\n2023 was the last ""rough"" year for both of them, since 2024 they\'re both been super consistent.', 'I’ve always been a fan of George. I like him as a person and I think he’s an excellent driver. Most fans underrate him, imho. Not really sure why. Even the incidents people cite for the reason they hate him seem to be fairly mild and quite infrequent compared to some of the others.\n\nEither way, I was thrilled for him this weekend. He deserves all of the praise coming his way.', ""If everyone was given the same car, Russell would be competitive. I stand that Mercedes has not looked great at the same time Russell has been there. You can look towards the 2020 Sakhir GP to see him always having race craft. I didn't need 2025 Canada and Singapore to see that. Any team would do well with Russell."", ""I think most people are coming around to him being one of the top drivers. He's definitely in the top 3, maybe even top 2 behind Verstappen."", ""I think Russell has been proving for a while that he's good enough and has enough grit to win a championship with a good car. Dsq or not, what he did last season at Spa was ridiculous."", 'He’s always been a great driver just the fans hated him for his posh accent 😂', 'Who are you fighting with? Most people have Russell as 2nd or 3rd best driver in the grid rn. This year he has certainly been at least number 2, specially now that Piastri is no longer up there.', ""He's always been a top tier driver *and* he is still improving and learning from mistakes. If he was in any of those 2 McLarens he'd have the WDC in the bag already imo.\n\nI don't get why Mercedes hasn't locked him with a multi-year contract already when he's always been a Merc driver, he's still young but experienced and he's so consistent and good. They should just give him what he wants and not risk losing him because as soon as they give him a car that can consistently fight for wins he's getting that championship.""]",85,79,0.75,85,73,73,85,79,0.75,85

Pretty graphics, explanations for the lay person.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@chainbear\n\nBut at a certain point you just gotta watch the race. There's not a lot that can be distilled into a short post. \n\nIt's a racing series where the main differentiator is that the Teams or Constructors need to build the *majority* of the car themselves (as opposed to a spec series where everyone has the same car).\n\nSome teams build their own engines and are considered 'works' teams, other teams buy an engine from Merc / Renault / Honda / Ferrari are are 'customer teams'. \n\nThere is a Constructor championship (team) and a Driver championship (individual), so you get lots of drama where what's good for the team is bad for the individual. \n\nEvery race requires 2 sets of tyre compounds, so you see different strategies."", 'That’s awesome first of all that your son is interested and you might have a cool father-son activity together.\n\nI would go to YouTube, and just look up videos explaining things about F1 for new viewers.

For myself it's seeing twenty (currently) drivers who are so talented, fast and consistent that they can lap a difficult track within tenths, hundredths or even thousandths of seconds from each other competing in a sport where every decision is impactful.

For me personally pre wing, or how Newey called them ""boring cigars on wheels"" would be the best.

Id find the championship much more fun if they switched several races on known difficult (boring, historical) tracks to historic cars. And could remove sprint races all together because IMO those do nothing to make it more appealing or interesting.

Can Verstappen realistically win the WDC this season? Let's have a look at how many points per race he needs to score, or better, by how many points per race he needs to outscore Piastri and Norris.


6 races and 3 sprints remain. 174 point total. Max needs to catch 6.84 points per race weekend on Lando and 10.5 points per race weekend on Oscar every race weekend for the next six races.


 Of the 18 races so far this year he has managed to do that exactly once. Baku, the worst race of the season for McLaren and the best for him. Is it realistic to expect this to happen for the next 6 races in a row? ","['Possible but not realistic since it isn’t even really in his hands.', 'Possible? Yes\n\nPlausible? Not really', 'its increasingly less about how good max can drive and how badly McLaren could mess up. winning is unlikely, pushing Lando to p3 is still very possible.', 'Is it realistic? Sure\n\nIs it going to happen? Probably not.\n\nThat being said, I feel like an Oscar and Lando crash is inevitable and that could really make it juicy, especially with Max racing his face off lately.', 'He has the same problem Norris had last year.\n\nHe not only needs to be perfect, but also the rest of the grid (and especially McLaren) to fail, which is unlikely to happen.', 'I think after today the chances of Oscar and Lando colliding again are quite high. If they take each other out that could bring Max right into it.\xa0', 'Max is not winning the championship. Mathematically he has a chance but realistically absolutely not. He literally needs to win every race and sprint from here on with Piastri finishing third in all of them. Very very unlikely.', ""50% / 50%. Either it wins it or it doesn't"", ""Swap Verstappen and Russell in today's result and that's probably a typical worst case scenario for McLaren. They might have another Baku, but probably also a few wins. DNFs for anyone is not out of the question either. Run a few variations of those and maybe Verstappen wins 5-10% of them.""]",0,62,0.45,0,58,58,0,17,0.010000000000000009,0
