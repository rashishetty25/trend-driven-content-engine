1mqs6kw,Lawson blames set-up gamble for Red Bull demotion,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mqs6kw/lawson_blames_setup_gamble_for_red_bull_demotion/,2025-08-15, News,,"[""The demotion actually has given him a chance to save his career.

Liam’s merch was mysteriously delayed for half a year and was set to “release” in June. \n\nBut then you also look at the optics of a Japanese driver in Yuki, sponsored by a major Japanese company, and right before the Japanese Grand Prix. I think they used and abused Lawson, scapegoated him for 2 races and then when Honda waved the big cheque they pounced because they knew it was the only way they could get significant funding this year with how terrible the car actually is.\n\n“Saving” Lawson as they put it was very much an afterthought quip to justify what they did.

Yuki’s career is now hanging on by a thread as a result of performing so well in the opening two rounds. \n\nI do think that second seat situation will improve in the next ten races.

It was great in the 1980s when engines were varied, but the modern regulations meant that it soon became pretty dull. The redesign kept the spirit of the original while improving overtaking opportunities and I do not think it deserves the criticism it gets. The same applies to Fuji. I know the switchback maybe is not terribly interesting, but I can see what Tilke was going for -- it is easy to get off-line when attacking or defending, and since that leads into a gargantuan straight, any mistake is really going to be felt going down to the first corner.
