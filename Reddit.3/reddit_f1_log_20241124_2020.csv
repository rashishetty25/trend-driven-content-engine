Then he rejoins the festivities. First, he says: ‚ÄúCould anyone else become champion in this car? I would say: I wish them good luck.‚Äù\n\nThere are emotions, there is relief and, above all, Max Verstappen is happy that it's over. At least, that with two races to go he has secured his fourth championship in a row. An incredible achievement. Especially when you consider that the Red Bull driver did not have the best material for months. He himself estimates that he has not had the fastest car for seventy percent of this season. Still, things are now decided. ‚ÄúI had thought we would have to fight until the last moment, but then luckily the rain came in Brazil. That worked out pretty well,‚Äù Verstappen said, referring to his fabulous victory at Interlagos, which indirectly meant the knockout for rival Lando Norris.\n\n**Proving them wrong**\n\nThe intermediate score, more than three and a half hours after he crossed the finish line in Las Vegas? ‚ÄúI've had four beers now and two gin tonics,‚Äù said Verstappen, now holding a can of Red Bull. ‚ÄúMost of all, I'm pretty relieved. The race wasn't great, but actually a little better than expected. It's nice that it's done now and we can go into the final races in Qatar and Abu Dhabi reasonably relaxed. There I still want to get some nice results.‚Äù By then he has already wittily taken revenge on McLaren boss Zak Brown, by rubbing his nose in his face that he can also become world champion in a non-dominant car. Referring to earlier statements by the American about Verstappen's titles in 2022 and 2023. ‚ÄúSuch things only motivate me. **If people are critical and think that I can only win in the best car, I prove them wrong. If I don't get credit for this now, I don't know what else I can do. Whether I would have become champion in the McLaren? Yes! And much sooner too. In 2021 in another car (the Mercedes, ed.) I would have taken the title as well. In 2022 it would have become more difficult, because Ferrari was perhaps a little too fragile then. And last year? Well, that would have been a bit trickier.‚Äù**\n\n**Not just shouting around**\n\nA roar of laughter followed, as Verstappen and Red Bull gave the concept of dominance a whole new dimension last season. At the beginning of this year, that's where things seemed to be heading as far as 2024 is concerned, too. But since early May, the panels have shifted considerably. The question is legitimate whether anyone else could have become champion in the RB20. Especially if you compare Verstappen's performance to that of teammate Sergio P√©rez. ‚ÄúWhether it could have been? We're in Vegas, so you can maybe bet on that. I would say I wish them good luck.‚Äù Verstappen acknowledges that he is happy with how he has handled disappointments this year. Intrigues were plentiful at Red Bull, both on and off the track. As recently as early September in Monza, he said that a world title was no longer realistic. ‚ÄúWe had quite a difficult time after a very good start. I am quite proud of how we got through that as a team. As a person it's important to stay calm and not just shout around that it all sucks. I wouldn't have been as good at that a few years ago. You learn that over the years, too. And a few championships help put it into perspective more easily.‚Äù\n\n**Never been desperate**\n\nIn Las Vegas, Verstappen stayed ahead of both McLaren drivers quite easily. Mercedes (George Russell won) and Ferrari had it better than Red Bull, though. It will be interesting next week in Qatar to see how the proportions are then. At that circuit, McLaren should normally come out well, as should Red Bull. ‚ÄúAnd we have to keep a close eye on everything...,‚Äù Verstappen is referring to the possible gimmicks McLaren might have used, at least according to Red Bull. ‚ÄúI'm very proud of this season, though. I never despaired, but we had a lot of conversations - including at the factory in Milton Keynes - about what we could do better. A lot has happened and it has been a tough year.‚Äù Now he stands at four world titles, as many as Alain Prost and Sebastian Vettel. And one more than, among others, his ‚Äúfather-in-law‚Äù Nelson Piquet. ‚ÄúBut the first time I met him I had nothing at all... Now, fortunately, that's a different story. He also became champion in Las Vegas in 1981. He sure knows how to party here.

1gyiz32,"Should the FIA make provision in the cost cap for crash damage? If so, how much, 50% rebate? 1st $1M then zero after that amount?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gyiz32/should_the_fia_make_provision_in_the_cost_cap_for/,2024-11-24, Discussion,I ask this because of Williams run of bad luck. And in previous years Haas and other teams. Personally I think the FIA should allow a siding deductible based upon your previous season team points. Last place gets the most damage spending removed from their cost cap (to a rational level) while the championship winning team receives the lowest allowance for damage costs simply because of their championship winning income. The point wouldn‚Äôt be to reward crazy driving but to mitigate a force majeure situation such as happened to Ferrari at last years Vegas event or another car spearing into you and wreaking you. What does everyone think? ,"['A racing team that hasn‚Äôt budgeted for crash damage probably shouldn‚Äôt be in racing.', ""No. That's racing."", ""No. It's the cost of going racing. This isn't a bad run of luck, these are all mistakes of their own making.\n\nIf you then get into what is crash damage and what is upgrades/obsolete parts, it gets way too complicated as well, very open to being exploited. Or if you give everybody the exemption, then it's just a higher cost cap and doesn't make any difference."", 'No', ""No, it's unfair to teams whose drivers aren't shit"", 'Luck? Drivers make mistake it has nothing to doo with luck.', 'By that logic, should teams that don‚Äôt crash also have some kind of privilege? Nonsense proposition.', ""No because crash damage is a very difficult and opaque measurement and can be calculated numerous ways and will be fought and argued over.\n\n\nI don't want arguments over whether or not haas has to have damage out of cap or not because they were mostly at fault vs a crash w Toro Rosso.\n\n\n\nAnd honestly if you don't want to pay crash damage.

1gyxl88,Should Maclaren start giving Oscar more attention ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gyxl88/should_maclaren_start_giving_oscar_more_attention/,2024-11-24, Discussion,I believe that with the base Maclaren has it is really close to win both championships the next season. But I believe that they should start thinking that meybe they are closer to do that with Oscar than they are with lando. They absolutely did a good job for not treating him as a second driver. But I think they should consider him as their first driver maybe it would work great for them they didn't achieve much with lando ,"['Oscar needs to get to the point where he‚Äôs regularly beating Lando for that to happen.\n\nQualy H2H is 19-3 between the two.

Lando is consistently beating Oscar at the moment on pure pace alone.', 'Other than your (apparent) emotional attachment to Oscar, is there anything in the data and results that bolster your claim and opinion?\n\nBoth are talented drivers and it might certainly be that Oscar develops into a future world champion. It is likely an almost equally good assertion for Lando. \n\nBut what, in your mind, does ""giving Oscar more attention"" even mean? You state that they did not treat him as a second driver. So are you thinking that they must now treat Lando as a ""second driver"" to assuage your beliefs?', ""I think Oscar needs to start driving better first.

I have no problem with Jenson Button, he is great, but whatever misfit was alongside him he did not ask a single good question. (can anyone educate me where he raced in?).

Before this the drivers where moved by cars to the podium, why didnt the cars just park at the strip, or was this a problem with the track invasion? It just took way to long to get the drivers back to the Strip, it was boring.

  
Also the podium looked like it was on top Aarav's Shed (the Shed) there seemed to be no atmosphere at all, also there was no cooldown room, at least the trophee looked nice. The gimmic of the drivers being lifted up onto the podium was not impressive at all.

  
The race itself also has a lot of problems, from it being way to extravagant to the fact that the track looks like a pig upside down.
