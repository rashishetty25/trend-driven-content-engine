1i78lvs,"Starting today, we are banning Twitter/X content on r/formula1. We urge all journalists, creators, photographers and other F1 personalities to also make their content available on alternative platforms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i78lvs/starting_today_we_are_banning_twitterx_content_on/,2025-01-22, Meta,"**TL;DR:** For a trial period we will ban all content from Twitter, with the intention to make this ban permanent in some form.

Hey everyone!

After [yesterday‚Äôs proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i6lm2v/proposal_to_ban_xcom_links/) we discussed within the mod team whether a full ban on Twitter content would be feasible. We had already been encouraging Bluesky as a source over other platforms, since by not forcing users to log in it is more accessible and it does not suffer from the various other issues affecting Twitter. Our main concern with a full ban is that while many F1 journalists have joined Bluesky, teams, drivers & FOM have not. But we also realize that it‚Äôs a *chicken or the egg problem* and as a community of almost 5 million, we probably have a non-trivial effect as to what platform is the native source for F1 news

In the end we‚Äôve settled on the following approach:

* For a trial period we will ban all content from Twitter with the only exception of screenshots of relevant posts by teams, drivers & F1 that are **not available on any other platform**. Even in case of major breaking news, we ask you to post links to the press releases or a screenshot of the post from Instagram, with a link in the comments.
* We hope that this trial period will provide a nudge for F1 journalists, creators and teams to make their content available on alternative platforms as **we intend to make this ban permanent in some form.**

Why a trial period? First of all, sometimes mods make bad decisions even if with the best intentions. (For example in 2015 this subreddit banned images & gifs, which caused a controversy that was only resolved after [Will Buxton stepped in to mediate the situation](https://redd.it/3jmslx).) Second of all, this is one of the strictest approaches to Twitter content and strict bans like this can have unintended consequences, so we might need to later refine this ban. We intend the trial period to last at least until the first races of the new season, after which a final form of the ban would be implemented.

This subreddit has had restrictions on what content can be posted for a very long time. We‚Äôve had the source rating system that labeled the quality of news sites and is still used for removing sensationalist and unoriginal articles. We‚Äôve also had limitations on Instagram due to its requirement for an account to view posts. There‚Äôs no doubt that over the past years Twitter has become a low-quality source: the login requirements, the flood of bots, the prioritization of content from paying users and promotion of sensationalist content. But unlike with news sites in our source-rating system, for Twitter there wasn‚Äôt really an alternative. But now that viable alternatives are emerging and the proposal thread from yesterday has shown that the community prefers those alternatives, **we think it‚Äôs time to try and see how the subreddit works without content from Twitter.**

# For journalists, photographers, creators & other F1 personalities

Our preferred alternative platform is Bluesky and to help avoid impersonations we have created a [list of verified F1 related accounts on Bluesky](https://go.bsky.app/57f6geP). This list is used both for feeds & starter packs on Bluesky, but also for AutoModerator here on Reddit. We are adding new verified accounts whenever we come across them, but please contact us on Bluesky or send a modmail here on Reddit to accelerate this process. We want to assist with this transition and we also want to hear your feedback throughout this trial period, so please get in touch.","[""Twitter was such a low bar for quality news anyway.

Firmly a top 10 driver of all time in my opinion \n\n4 consecutive world titles is an incredible feat, and he had to fight Lewis and prime Alonso to get to them in 2010 and 2012. I also don‚Äôt think the car advantage was as massive as people pretend it was, particularly in 2010. I simply think Seb was just the best guy that season. \n\nBy the end of his career, the only guys he had really ‚Äúlost‚Äù to were Ricciardo and Leclerc.

Otherwise I don't think anyone underrates him."", ""I have almost automatically 10 spots filled just by filling in all time greats of their era. So it then becomes, do you put someone like Lauda out for Vettel? It is hard to say what is more impressive given almost nobody has a true idea how impressive it is given most weren't around back then, nor is there good footage to go off by.\n\nI for sure wouldn't put Vettel in front of: Clark, Verstappen, Schumacher, Hamilton, Senna, Prost, Fangio, Stewart, Alonso"", 'I wouldn‚Äôt say Vettel definitely isn‚Äôt a top ten driver of all time, but to say he ‚Äòfirmly‚Äô is would be a stretch in my opinion. Having watched every season back to 1990, I would say Schumacher, Lewis, Max, Alonso, Senna and Prost were all more complete drivers than him. In order for him to be top ten all time, I have to rate him higher than at least three of Ascari, Fangio, Moss, Clark, Stewart and Lauda and that seems like a stretch. What I will say however is that I think there‚Äôs a cut off point where it is really difficult to compare driver ability between eras due to various changes in the sport, and I think that cut off point occurs somewhere around the mid to late 80s.\n\nI will firmly disagree on 2010. Seb hit his team-mate in Turkey, turned a win into a third by flouting the SC rules in Hungary and had a nightmare at Spa. He left a hypothetical 50 points on the table as a result of those errors, which no other contender - not even Alonso during his early-season flurry of uncharacteristic errors - came close to. If you add in the 75 points turned into 12 through mechanical failures in Bahrain, Australia and Korea then you can see the potential was there for that car & driver combination to win the title by 110-120 points. Sure enough, that‚Äôs the exact margin they won by the following year. And even if Seb is as great as his most ardent supporter thinks he is, he isn‚Äôt beating prime Lewis or Alonso by that margin in equally matched equipment.\n\nI would also argue the four successive titles is overstated. I‚Äôm not saying it isn‚Äôt a brilliant achievement, what I‚Äôm saying is that if you put a top driver into the best car with an inferior team mate for four years, you should expect him to win four successive titles. To me, what determines greatness in that scenario is not that you win, but how you win, and to Seb‚Äôs credit I will agree that 2011 and 2013 were absolutely exceptional, and in 2012 his racecraft took a giant leap forward.\n\nOn your point about the car advantage not being as big as it appeared, I would say there were certain instances I‚Äôd agree the results don‚Äôt really give the full context. For example, the results would tell you the RB7 was an absolutely untouchable rocketship, but in reality McLaren were snipping at its heels at a good number of races that year. They threw away Monaco by two-stopping Jenson, at Spa Jenson could‚Äôve won if it wasn‚Äôt for a botched quali and a couple of other races - Spain and Singapore come to mind - were quite close. The car was undoubtedly quite clearly the quickest over the balance of the year, but what made 2011 impressive compared to 2010 was that Seb passed the tests he faced with flying colours and without unforced errors.\n\nI would also contend the years alongside Ricciardo and Leclerc give off a somewhat inaccurate impression that they were fundamentally better than him. In 2014 Seb had to readjust his driving style to accommodate for the loss of the blown diffusers, then in 2019 I feel Seb was still reeling from the mental drubbing Lewis gave him in the back end of the prior year. He made several notable errors but Charles still only beat him by a small margin, so it‚Äôs clear on raw ability alone Seb still had the goods.\n\nWith the passing of time it‚Äôs clear to me Seb is becoming more and more misunderstood. If you take the results as gospel you‚Äôd conclude he was GOATed, but if you take the critics as gospel you‚Äôd conclude he was a Newey merchant. The truth is somewhere in the middle.', ""While I do think you're overrating Seb, the biggest reason he isn't a top 10 driver of all time is because F1 has been around for 75 years.

1i6ns3t,What's the minimum healthy number of teams for a sustainable F1 grid,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i6ns3t/whats_the_minimum_healthy_number_of_teams_for_a/,2025-01-21, Discussion,"I've heard 12, I've heard 14, I've also heard that the league struggles to maintain 10 teams.  

I'm sure there are situations that can change the number so I'm basically asking, right now, how many teams you feel F1 should grow/shrink to for maximum health of the sport.

In my opinion F1 should look to target 12 active teams if possible.  I think that's a good number to allow 3-4 to struggle at any given time without majorly impacting the competitiveness of the entire grid and ensuring a competitive midpack, which as we saw in 2023 and  2024 can be vital for the longterm viability of the sport with McLaren and Aston Martin emerging from the midpack to challenge for top positions (and then Aston Martin falling back, but it was still fun while it lasted).

Bottom line in my mind 12 teams is the right number to maintain a healthy midpack from which new challengers for the stop spots might emerge.  This is entirely my own opinion but I'm curious what others think.","[""I think the maximum sustainable number is 13 since it's required for a circuit to be able to accommodate that, but a few probably wouldn't be able to support any more. So circuits would have to change and that would be strenuous for contracts.\n\nI think 12 is a good aim, we've had 12 recently without any issues.\n\nMinimum is probably pretty low, like 7 or 8, but that's an absolute minimum and not ideal"", 'Definitely more than 3, that gives 2005 US GP vibes.\n\nAPXGP made it 11 teams, are you saying they don‚Äôt count?', ""10 Seemed to work well, and I would think that's the minimum. I would love to see 12, but man, qually is gonna be a nightmare on some circuits."", "" It's doing fine now, probably sometime in the time where it's had 10 teams 20 drivers has had it's most popular period ever, so I don't see how you can think that 10 is below the minimum needed. \n\nI do think below 10 teams of two cars each might be bad for the sport. Not that it would die, but I think it would be bad. It's why I can't actually resent Lawrence Stroll, because without him we really might have gone down to nine teams, and the other teams still would have fought against an addition. \n\nI think ten teams is good. I think eleven teams will be good. I think 12 teams would be fine. I think more than 24 of these cars in some tracks is pretty dicey. Of course, there are the tracks that are already too small, but that is usually a width problem."", 'The bigger you get, the more likelihood that the worst team will be SO bad that they are a danger to themselves and everyone else by being so far off the pace that they affect the top teams more than the midfield does. I imagine it was pretty terrible watching the same two cars qualify P21 and P22 and do 3 seconds a lap slower than the pace for seasons on end.', 'I think 11 is good enough.
