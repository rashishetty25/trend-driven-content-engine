The top 8 then enter a knockout style qualifying tournament: 1st from Q2 against 8th, 2nd v 7th etc. One lap each, winner progresses to semi final. We‚Äòll have semi finals, a final and 3rd place playoff to determine the top 4 and equally with the losers from the quarter finals we‚Äòll have that for P5-8.

1kvtxkz,How do you decide YOUR best driver?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kvtxkz/how_do_you_decide_your_best_driver/,2025-05-26, Discussion,"I know, discussions about who is best and who didnt deserve it are old and kind of boring, but no inner discussion keeps me thinking so long and having so different views and I am just talking about the things happening in my own head. 

The ""typical"" greats are often drivers from different areas so it is really hard to compare them equally and not only did the quality of cars in general improved massively but also technical differences like stick-shift to automatic, engines etc. 

Without mentioning any names, what are the attributes a driver needs to have to be your number one or top 5 etc.? 

  
For me it is the circumstances a driver gets and what he makes out of it. There are drivers who have multiple championships with multiple cars and there are drivers who sit in one nearly perfect car and win, but mostly very close of their teammate. 

And currently my view on another driver shifts, because I thought he has the best car, but it seems that either he is an unbelievable driver or no one can use the car, but him. ","['Mostly vibes, and when someone comes with good arguments for another driver, I use my emotional arguments to justify my personal bests.', 'I don‚Äôt.

1kvh5qj,Monaco and Minimum Lap Times - Would it Work?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kvh5qj/monaco_and_minimum_lap_times_would_it_work/,2025-05-26, Discussion,"I think the mandatory two-stop rule could have worked to some degree in Monaco, if it wasn't for teams/drivers, backing up the grid to create advantageous pit stop gaps.

It wasn't interesting to watch and somehow made Monaco even more boring to watch.

But what if drivers had to keep to a minimum lap time throughout each lap? Governed by some metric, which I'm sure wouldn't be too difficult to work out and enforce (drivers would have a delta to follow), which would eradicate this backing up nonsense. Monaco isn't going anywhere. It's too steeped in history and has far too much significance with Formula 1, so I do think it's a good idea to mandate some interesting rules to help improve the racing, even though on-track overtaking is at a minimum/non-existent.

Would there be a reason this couldn't realistically work?

Edit: Sorry, this is also assuming the mandatory two-stop remains as a rule.","[""If you can't overtake a guy driving a year off the pace, you can't overtake.

1kvon1d,Is Antonelli performing beneath expectations?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kvon1d/is_antonelli_performing_beneath_expectations/,2025-05-26, Discussion,"This post might bring controversy, but I think young Kimi is performing slightly worse than expected, further overshadowed by all the praise about Hadjar recently. So far he has less than half the points of GR, 0-10 vs GR in race/sprint h2h, and 2-8 in qualifying h2h.

GR is great, and honestly I don‚Äôt think race pace, mistakes, (like losing the lead at the sprint) or even crashes are worrying, but it‚Äôs the raw pace that he has yet to show. In my understanding, speed is mostly not taught, and most great drivers become competitive in qualifying just about immediately. I think it is slightly concerning that Kimi has mostly struggled with qualifying thus far other than in Miami.

Can anyone who has followed him through his junior career give some input on how we should view his performance thus far?

Edit: after reading some responses, I admit it‚Äôs my expectations of him being a generational talent that are too high and not fair. Hopefully he will get plenty of lease at Merc to develop!","[""He's doing fine. 1 crash at Monaco Q1 and a spin in terrible conditions at Melbourne \n\nA pole and top 3 qualifying at miami.
