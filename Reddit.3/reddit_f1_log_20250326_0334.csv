As a Perez fan, I agreed with this viewpoint simply on the basis that it felt like Perez was a bit closer to the ultimate pace than Albon was. He had five podiums, lost an all-but-certain podium to late mechanical failure in Abu Dhabi, lost a probable podium in Austria to a slow pit stop, a potential podium to a VSC in Brazil and was on course for one when the rain came down in Russia. He also had some on-track battles with Lewis that made him look very good, especially in the context of RBR desperately needing a driver to play a supporting role to Max. He had some lows but the potential was there for greater things and he fulfilled that (and then some) the following year.\n\nHowever, I’m curious - how much of that was Perez simply looking better than Albon because of the context? And how much of it was down to him looking better by being in a better car? Could the optics have simply been very kind to Perez?\n\nAnother thing with Albon is he scored a whopping 78% of Max’s points in 2019, which could’ve been over 95% if Lewis hadn’t yeeted him at the finish in Brazil. Yes, Albon was massively flattered by Max having problems at Spa, Monza, Suzuka and Mexico City - some his fault, some not.

1jjzjy2,Can someone explain the Lawson Tsunoda drama? Outside of Yuki potentially taking Liams seat. Is there bad blood?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jjzjy2/can_someone_explain_the_lawson_tsunoda_drama/,2025-03-26, Discussion,"I've seen all the recent posts about Yuki potentially replacing him in Japan but is there bad blood between them? I've read comments that they have both been talking shit at one point or another?

I know they raced each other in the junior series but I wasn't really following that level too closely.","['They were actually good friends a while back. Red Bull puts their juniors up in the same block of flats in Milton Keynes, so you’d see them on stream together (same with Vips before his gamer moment). \n\nI think a lot of the shit talk is media saying half of a quote to them mixed in with the obvious conflict over both wanting that seat. \n\nTsunoda was asked whether he’s ready to take the seat. He said 100%. Reasonable question, reasonable answer. He was asked if he’d do better than Lawson in the RB21 in China, he said he didn’t drive in it in China so he doesn’t know but he didn’t feel he was too far off Max in his Abu Dhabi test.\n\nLawson was told ‘Yuki is saying he’s ready to take your seat’ and Lawson has hit back saying ‘Well actually I beat him in juniors and F1 so he can say what I want’. Lawson was probably a bit sensitive considering everyone was talking about him coming P20 twice and clearly struggling and the reporters have used the exact thing that would provoke him.\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see how they go. Gasly and Albon made up after the media played them off against each other in 2019 and 2020 and they weren’t friends before it.', 'Yuki has never talked negatively about Lawson. Lawson recently claimed he was better than Yuki in the junior categories, without looking at the context of the car they had under them.', 'From Yuki about 2 weeks ago: \n\n“I wouldn’t say I’m happy for him. Like, that’s kind of a lie. He has done definitely what he should do and, he gave his best. He gave definitely a 100% performance, and, also, I gave 100%. It was in the end up to Red Bull how they’re going to do it.”\n\n“We’re still friends for sure, and we still chat each other, and I like to talk to him. And, yes, since 2020, before that, actually, we had a lot of time that we are teammates, driving in the same categories.”\n\n(via: GPblog)\n\nThey are used to competing with each other and have been rivals for many years. Lawson’s been more defensive in his recent comments about deserving the seat “he’s had his time, now it’s my time” and saying he beat Yuki in the junior series, he has no sympathy for Yuki getting passed over but I think that’s just due to the pressure and him trying to be all like i’m not here to feel bad for others/make friends i’m here to win etc.', 'Nobody’s come to Liam’s defense in the paddock, so he’s made some relatively harmless statements of confidence pointing back to how he’s bested Yuki in the past.\xa0\n\nIt’s a mountain out of a molehill, IMO.\xa0\n\nRB screwed up and put both guys in a bad situation. Hopefully Yuki makes the most of this opportunity.\xa0', ""Both competing for the same competitive seat and a little bit of history from their junior days.

It's all media-manufactured BS like the Norris/Verstappen stuff last year."", 'They used to be teammates in the junior categories and I’m sure Redbull gmbh is stirring up drama for the media, because who doesn’t like a bit of drama?

1jjcr23,New Netflix show suggestion,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jjcr23/new_netflix_show_suggestion/,2025-03-25, Discussion,"# The Problem:

With the support of the FIA, I think there should be a new show to complement *Drive to Survive*.

I don’t mind *Drive to Survive*, but it has become more of a drama series than an in-depth coverage of the sport. While it’s great for bringing in new fans, it has also led to a wave of social media discourse from people who don’t fully understand the complexities of F1.

Formula 1 is an incredibly intricate sport, with countless elements that make it fascinating—car design, engines, racecraft, team strategies, and so much more. Yet, a lot of new fans miss these aspects, leading to takes like this one from the past few days:

>

This kind of misunderstanding happens all the time, and it’s frustrating because these are fundamental parts of the sport that have existed for decades.

# The Idea:

A new show that dives into the technical and strategic side of F1—covering the rules, mechanics, racecraft, and innovations that define the sport.

Each episode could focus on a different aspect:

* **Engines** – The different suppliers, why some teams build their own while others rely on manufacturers, how engines are managed across a season, cooling systems, and FIA regulations.
* **Car Regulations & Innovation** – How teams design their cars within the rules, how they push boundaries, and the technical loopholes they exploit.
* **Racecraft & Strategy** – The tactical decisions made during a race, pit stop strategies, driver-team communications, and how they impact performance.
* **Behind the Scenes** – A day in the life of a pit crew member, engineers, and mechanics, showcasing their roles and contributions.

With engaging visuals, expert commentary, and perhaps even actors or F1-loving celebrities acting as the audience, asking the questions casual fans might have, this show could bridge the gap between hardcore fans and newcomers.

What do you think? Would you watch something like this?","['A lot of this is available on F1TV', 'Most of this is already done on F1TV - they have tons of content explaining the more technical aspects, strategy and history of the sport', '> Car Regulations & Innovation – How teams design their cars within the rules, how they push boundaries, and the technical loopholes they exploit.\n\nI hardly think you\'ll get an indepth insider giving you the scoop on how they exploit loop holes!\n\n""hey Binotto, can you give us the scoop on fuel flow limits""\n\n""Sure!
