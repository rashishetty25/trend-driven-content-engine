I’m beginning to completely reassess my opinion of Albon and this is mostly independent of (but definitely prompted by) how he’s doing against Sainz right now.\n\nAlbon in 2020 scored 49% of Max’s points compared to Perez scoring 48% the following year, yet Perez was widely considered to have been an improvement. As a Perez fan, I agreed with this viewpoint simply on the basis that it felt like Perez was a bit closer to the ultimate pace than Albon was. He had five podiums, lost an all-but-certain podium to late mechanical failure in Abu Dhabi, lost a probable podium in Austria to a slow pit stop, a potential podium to a VSC in Brazil and was on course for one when the rain came down in Russia. He also had some on-track battles with Lewis that made him look very good, especially in the context of RBR desperately needing a driver to play a supporting role to Max. He had some lows but the potential was there for greater things and he fulfilled that (and then some) the following year.\n\nHowever, I’m curious - how much of that was Perez simply looking better than Albon because of the context? And how much of it was down to him looking better by being in a better car? Could the optics have simply been very kind to Perez?\n\nAnother thing with Albon is he scored a whopping 78% of Max’s points in 2019, which could’ve been over 95% if Lewis hadn’t yeeted him at the finish in Brazil. Yes, Albon was massively flattered by Max having problems at Spa, Monza, Suzuka and Mexico City - some his fault, some not. It’s also worth noting that Albon was basically guaranteed at least sixth even on a bad day in 2019. But even then, Albon still did quite well. \n\nIt all makes me question - how many drivers could do what Albon did alongside Max right now?

1jjmtna,"What is the psychology behind fast drivers in a midfield team, suddenly not being able to perform in a top team?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jjmtna/what_is_the_psychology_behind_fast_drivers_in_a/,2025-03-25, Discussion,"This has happened so many times in recent F1 history: a midfield driver shows real raw pace and promise, gets picked up by a top team, and then suddenly struggles to perform anywhere near the level they previously showed. Perez at McLaren and then again at Red Bull, Bottas in his first couple of seasons at Mercedes, Kovalainen at McLaren, and to some extent Fisichella at Renault—all drivers who looked seriously quick in midfield cars but just couldn’t make the same impact at the front.

Why is it that these drivers, who seem to be excelling in less competitive machinery, suddenly become mediocre?

Excluding the obvious Red Bull examples—it’s a pretty well-established fact that RBR, understandably, design their car to suit Verstappen’s unique driving style, so it’s not really a mystery why rookies like Gasly, Albon, and Lawson have struggled.

But for the others, what’s going on? Is it the pressure? Better teammates? Worse teammates in their midfield car making them look better? The car being more sensitive? Team dynamics? It just seems strange how often this happens. And on the other end of the spectrum—why do drivers like Leclerc, Verstappen, and Ricciardo manage to hit the ground running straight away?

Why do good midfield drivers struggle so much when they get into a top car?","[""Perez - Verstappen\n\nBottas/Kovaleinen - Hamilton\n\nFisichella - Alonso\n\nThe drivers you named simply aren't on the level of their new teammates, so they look bad. That's all there is to it."", 'I think there’s a ton of factors here, but I think a lot of it comes down to the fact that the standards are lower for a midfield car. Your teammate probably isn’t a multiple time world champion pushing for the championship so it’s a bit of guesswork where a midfield car “should” end up on a given weekend based on purely the driver. That tracing point car in 2020 probably would’ve been on a lot more podiums with max/lewis in it. \n\nSo that means you just have to show flashes of pace and can get away with being inconsistent because on those off days you just finish in the midfield as expected and people don’t really notice or can’t say how much of it was the driver not performing. When you’re in a top team driving vs someone who delivers every weekend and the expectation becomes podium or you shit the bed then those off days become a lot more noticeable.', ""Part of it is clearly the car. Making the car go as fast as physically possible might make it difficult to drive. \n\nMaybe some of them are overrated, too. One of the hardest things in F1 is to accurately judge a car's pace. If it comes sixth, is it sixth fastest? Maybe better drivers would take it to fourth or fifth, slower drivers to seventh or eighth.\n\nIf a driver is super quick in midfield but then slow compared to an elite driver, maybe he wasn't super quick after all. The car or teammate could have flattered him.\n\nYou can generally tell when you have an elite level driver on your hands in the lower part of the grid, like a Max, Charles, Alonso, etc. (Lewis had already proved himself at the top before the McLaren dropped back in the pack.)\n\nOf the drivers you listed, I don't think anyone expected any to be elite and thrive at the top as more than a number 2. Bottas and Perez achieved what was expected really. Kovalainen was nothing special to begin with. I was only a kid, but I remember expecting Fisichella to do a bit more, but he wasn't that great to begin with either."", ""I just am going to say this: Verstappen doesn't have 'a unique driving style'. He's just extremely good at adapting to any car. Even if a car sucks, he will get the most out of it."", ""Well, one thing to consider is that maybe the midfield car was actually better than midfield? If Red Bull had 2x Perez in the car last year it would be considered a midfield car. If we didn't see what Max can do in the same car, we would have no idea. \n\nSo perhaps the Williams that Bottas was driving before going to Mercedes was a better car than we think it was?\n\nPlus I don't know what you expected from Perez, he was quite evenly matched with Ocon. If anything, a better driver would win a few races in that Pink Mercedes in 2020."", 'My guess here is that those cars of the top teams in question have a very narrow operating window. In terms of aerodynamics, oversteer, weight transfer, etc. \n\nIt’s the “min-maxing” of a design in a similar way you make a very specialized character in a video game where he excels in a single context but doesn’t really shine everywhere else. \n\nSo these cars are hard to drive properly, utilizing that edge that Max can handle.

1jjpkv8,So what exactly happened to Ricciardo?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jjpkv8/so_what_exactly_happened_to_ricciardo/,2025-03-25, Discussion,"I was thinking of Sainz today and his recent struggles, and it reminded me of Ricciardo. But that brought me down memory lane, and it made me realize something. Off the top of my head, I frankly cannot remember another top driver that inexplicably became washed like that, other than maybe Hakkinen in 2001, but he retired immediately and he just looked burned out.

Ricciardo crushed Vettel, was within 2 tenths of Max in quali in 2017-2018 and generally competitive in race(ok, young Max, but still, the pace was there), convincingly beat Hulkenberg and Ocon who are good midfield drivers, both were on par with Perez for example.

Then he gets his move to Mclaren, outqualifies Norris in 3 of the first 4 races, but then suddenly goes off-pace. Like totally off-pace, he gets lapped in Monaco IIRC. Yea, he won Monza, but the talk about it at the time was how big of a surprise that was after Ricciardo’s struggles.

Ok, let’s say the 2021 Mclaren just didn’t suit Ricciardo, but then 2022 comes, totally different regulations, and Ricciardo only gets worse. Maybe Mclaren’s design philosophy just doesn’t fit his style.

Moves to VCARB, everyone expected him to do better against Tsunoda, but frankly, he’s not. He’s slower again. At this point I guess his confidence just got shot, but seeing how him being kicked affected him, that was not a man that was ready to leave F1.

So what exactly happened to Ricciardo? For a driver that for a good few years(2014-2020) was basically a consensus top 5 driver on the grid, worthy of becoming a champion in the right car, to suddenly lose that much pace.

I’ve seen the theory that Ricciardo can’t handle understeer, and 2021 Mclaren had a lazy nose. And then the 2022 regulations made the cars inherently less active in the front, so that affected him even more. But is that really it? Throughout his career I’m sure he drove plenty of cars with a lazy front, and he never looked that bad.

With the support of the FIA, I think there should be a new show to complement *Drive to Survive*.

I don’t mind *Drive to Survive*, but it has become more of a drama series than an in-depth coverage of the sport. While it’s great for bringing in new fans, it has also led to a wave of social media discourse from people who don’t fully understand the complexities of F1.

Formula 1 is an incredibly intricate sport, with countless elements that make it fascinating—car design, engines, racecraft, team strategies, and so much more. Yet, a lot of new fans miss these aspects, leading to takes like this one from the past few days:

This kind of misunderstanding happens all the time, and it’s frustrating because these are fundamental parts of the sport that have existed for decades.

# The Idea:

A new show that dives into the technical and strategic side of F1—covering the rules, mechanics, racecraft, and innovations that define the sport.

Each episode could focus on a different aspect:

* **Engines** – The different suppliers, why some teams build their own while others rely on manufacturers, how engines are managed across a season, cooling systems, and FIA regulations.
* **Car Regulations & Innovation** – How teams design their cars within the rules, how they push boundaries, and the technical loopholes they exploit.
* **Racecraft & Strategy** – The tactical decisions made during a race, pit stop strategies, driver-team communications, and how they impact performance.
* **Behind the Scenes** – A day in the life of a pit crew member, engineers, and mechanics, showcasing their roles and contributions.

With engaging visuals, expert commentary, and perhaps even actors or F1-loving celebrities acting as the audience, asking the questions casual fans might have, this show could bridge the gap between hardcore fans and newcomers.

I trust CanalPlus with Red Bull news, they were spot on earlier with the Perez contracts, so I think it's just a matter of time before the official announcement.

  
That being said, this isn't the news you think it is. Christian Horner [confirms that you need two cars scoring for the championship.](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/you-have-to-have-two-cars-scoring-horner-assesses-red-bulls-chances-of.2vOR3JBZW7rfvyODcokbSH) He and Marko both seem more concerned about losing the championship than individually rating a driver's performance or a car's performance. This means that the Yuki call-up is more of a way for them to save their championship, than to actually ""replace"" Lawson forever. This leads to only one possible theory, based on Red Bull's past actions, intentions, and confirmed actions:

Red Bull want to switch Lawson with his teammate who somewhat beat him in overall performance last year (not going into the specifics of how/where).

IF Tsunoda gets into the points (highly unlikely), the championship can still be salvaged. Horner is happy, Marko is satisfied and Yuki stays in Red Bull.

IF Tsunoda performs slightly better than Lawson but still in the P15-18 range (a lot more likely than option 1), the championship still cannot be salvaged. They have NO reason to leave Tsunoda in there. Past intentions show that they rate Lawson more than Tsunoda despite publicly available performance data showing otherwise. They WILL switch back Tsunoda and Lawson after a few more races. [Colapinto will head to Racing Bulls](https://es.motorsport.com/f1/news/red-bull-planea-dar-colapinto-asiento-racing-bulls/10706562/) and replace Tsunoda mid-season just like Lawson did to Ricciardo, i.e., Tsunoda will be out of a seat in F1 and scrambling for one for next year.

To summarize the most likely path of events,

Lawson/Tsunoda switch in Japan. Tsunoda doesn't perform well enough to have a chance at the championship which is the motivator behind this switch. Tsunoda and Lawson switch back. Colapinto, if contracts can be signed, replaces Tsunoda mid-season. Tsunoda is without a seat.

It looked nailed on around Spa that Ricciardo would be jumping into the Red Bull, numerous reports that the Verstappen camp fully expected it and were surprised when it didn’t materialise for whatever reason. Once that decision was made the writing was really on the wall, but I don’t think anyone really expected them to pull the trigger mid season like they did. In my opinion, they should’ve given him to the end of the year and if they’d made the decision to get rid of Checo, could’ve lined up like this in 2025:

RBR: Verstappen/Ricciardo
RB: Tsunoda/Lawson

Hadjar as reserve wouldn’t have been the worst move for his career, and if Ricciardo struggled they then had the option of swapping one of Lawson or Tsunoda into the seat. A year or two would’ve been Daniel’s max stint anyway and that time to develop would’ve benefitted Lawson and allowed Hadjar his route into the sport.

The advantage Ricciardo offered was his years of experience on what by all accounts is a difficult car, and the fact he likes a pointy front end similar to Max and so set up wise they’d be more aligned. It would also give us an insight into just how far Max’s set up has taken the car, and also once and for all answered the Ricciardo question.

They have all the data, but they gambled hard with their drivers, and only have themselves to blame.', 'Just let him go.', 'To some degree, yes. The issue really does seem to be that so few drivers can handle a pointy front end car. Daniel can, or at least used to. \n\nI feel like the solution should have been to try him out last year after the summer break and see what happened. Guess we’ll never know.', 'In my opinion, I’ve always believed that it made sense to at least give Daniel a go in the Red Bull, you didn’t have much to lose \n\nIf Daniel did well then great, Red Bull have a temporary short term solution while they figure out which one of the juniors will be the next in line for the main team\n\nIf Daniel struggled then you cut him loose and he’d probably shake your hand and say thanks for giving him an opportunity\n\nRed Bull are now in a situation where they’re unnecessarily burning through their juniors and putting even more intense pressure on the next person they hope can be the solution to the second seat', 'The great tragedy is he never got back into the Red Bull car for an extended run to see what was there in the tank.\xa0\n\nHe did the test, they were impressed, they wanted him back so they sent him to prove his red bull pace in a car that is absolutely nothing like the red bull???\xa0\n\nCan’t say age when there is older drivers, consistency was a factor but when you don’t mesh with the car that will be a problem. Had the same issue at McLaren still managed to win a race. \xa0\n\nThe injury obviously didn’t help his chances, but there was certainly an opportunity when the constructors was obviously lost to let him have a farewell tour at the very least before they shifted gears to Lawson.\xa0\n\nDanny is happily retired though if Cadillac can’t stir any interest I doubt this Red Bull car can either.\xa0', 'They might as well call the car a ""Mechanical Bull"" at this point because it keeps throwing off whoever is stupid enough to have a go.', 'He was the option that made the most sense and I am still stunned at how short sighted the situation was. [And I am positive it almost happened.](https://www.instagram.com/share/reel/BAHtt3aOr6)', ""They should've canned Perez in the middle of last season and put in Ricciardo. Would've ended this stupid debate on whether Ricciardo would fit the RBR seat or not. Lawson would've had more time in the VCARB as well.""]",0,97,0.34,0,863,863,0,1,0.0,0
