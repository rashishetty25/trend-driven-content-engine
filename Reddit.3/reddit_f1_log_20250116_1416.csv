Here is the plot showing the average price of race tickets as a percentage of monthly salaries in the country. Tickets seem to be the most expensive in Mexico, Brazil, and Azerbaijan. Is this a result of costly tickets or low salaries? Can locals even attend these races or are they for tourists? Are these races a tourist attraction boosting tourism in these countries? Let me know in the comments.

Tickets were 150€ at a bronze grandstand.\n\nIn Europe, flights are really cheap if you go with a budget airline, so a trip to Budapest wouldn't really break the bank for anyone.\n\nIf you factor in the cost of tickets+travel+accommodations most European races will cost you over 1400€. Monza was one of the races I wanted to go to, but any grandstand tickets became unattainable when they were charging 400€+ for a grandstand ticket.\n\nI think with being frugal you'd probably spend about 400-500€/person if you go to the Budapest race (but that if you find cheap flights and rent out an Airbnb during the race weekend and you're from Europe). Food and travel costs around Budapest and to the circuit are pretty cheap.

Definitely better value if you went for the whole weekend though.', 'Why is Hungry flipping me off', ""Mexico and Brazil have low salaries that I know from knowing people who were incredibly happy that they managed to get American jobs that paid in US Dollars. Brazil in particular was having insane inflation, and with being paid in US Dollars, he was able to buy a house outright, because the inflation is so crazy that mortgages are not given out. I guessed that Azerbaijan had low salaries as well, and a quick google check confirmed it. Monaco just doesn't look right, but you can dig into it and it makes a bit more sense. There are very normal people in Monaco who are citizens and can only afford to live there because they get housing discounts or allowances or something. But there are also lots of multi multi millionaires and some billionaires. I guess if it's median, it knocks those out. It's also noteworthy that a lot of Monaco's citizens just watch from their balcony or from a friend's balcony. Young Charles Leclerc would go to a friend's balcony. So yeah in Monaco probably a huge percentage of paying attendees are foreign. In other races, there are a lot of people from inside the country, though also a fair number of foreigners. Baku I think also has some areas where locals can sneakily watch for free though I don't think as many areas like Monaco.

O'Ward says that after getting P8 with Carlin in Indycar, Helmut got in contact with him an gave him a Formula 1 contract for what would have been 2020. Patricio says that he was on his way to F1, that Charlie Whiting gave the green light and all. Charlie dies and a new team arrives, referred by O'Ward as ""the French team"", they block O'Ward's SL due to a lack of points by not counting his Indy Lights points due to the number of cars not meeting the minimum to reward full points. This is the part when he is sent to Japan to get points, that he does not receive because he does not complete the season. In the end, O'Ward claims that the FIA did it on purpose to protect ""A Frenchman"" from losing his seat (honestly, just should have said Gasly, with the timeframe is very clear).

While I don't doubt there were politics involved because FIA, I find interesting that depending on who he talks to, his tone changes. In both english and spanish he is kinda hostile to the FIA, but in english has claimed ""Red Bull let me go"", while in spanish verions (i've seen) of the story is ""I cut with Red Bull"" (as if he was the one leaving, not Marko telling him to go).

Other thing I find interesting is what would have been Red Bull's structure for 2020, I asume VER-ALB in RBR and KVY-OWA in AT with Gasly dropped.","['Since when does the race director hand out super licenses?', ""This doesn't pass the sniff test.

1i2oo0q,Lando Norris: McLaren’s overstated pace advantage in F1 2024 a ‘compliment’ [Motorsport Week],https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i2oo0q/lando_norris_mclarens_overstated_pace_advantage/,2025-01-16, News,,"['““It’s been better than people have thought,” he expressed. “There’s definitely been some missed opportunities. That’s a fact.\n\n“But I’m very happy with my whole season. I still feel like I’ve got a lot out of it. Things have not just gone to plan. There’s been certain races which have gone away from us.\n\n“But I’m pretty happy with the whole season that I had, because it’s clear when things do go right, how amazing that they can be.”', 'He\'s right. I did a deeper dive into this a month ago...McLaren were only *most likely* the quickest car in a *plurality* of races (NOT majority), and when they were the quickest, the only tracks where their pace was RB 2023 levels of dominant were Zandvoort, Hungary, and Singapore. Every other track where they were quickest, the pace advantage was very slight, and their overall advantage on low fuel in race trim throughout the year did alot of work there.\n\nThe problem is people don\'t properly paint the context of what the McLaren was. It was ""the best car, by a little bit, more frequently than any one other car, but even still typically lacked in the straight line speed and DRS departments"". People frequently talk about it as if the context was the same as the red bull Max drove in 2023 though, which is frankly ridiculous.', 'Yeah exactly, it was ahead on some tracks and reasonably competitive on a lot of them but it wasn\'t miles ahead every other race like mercedes or red bull had.\n\n\nSomehow people talk as if Norris should have been many seconds up the road in 1st every race because ""it\'s the fastest"" which irked me, as they then blame the driver skill as the only possible explanation and hounded him on it.\n\n\nIt will be interesting to see how this year goes and how much development lando has gone through along with the car. I don\'t quite think it\'s a generational talent like Alonso, Hamilton and verstappen but he\'s very good and has too improve still.', ""How do you know what's the real gap to other cars when drivers aren't equal. Maybe if you swapped Lando and Max Red Bull loses a tenth and McLaren gains a tenth and the gap that wasn't big at first becomes quite noticeable"", 'Even in Singapore we don’t know how dominant Lando would’ve been if the Ferraris were starting alongside him. They instead couldn’t show their true pace cause they started at the back.', '""People frequently talk about it as if the context was the same as the red bull Max drove in 2023 though, which is frankly ridiculous.""\n\nI also saw people claim Mclaren was just the 5th best car this year,\xa0which is frankly ridiculous.', '>Somehow people talk as if Norris should have been many seconds up the road in 1st every race because ""it\'s the fastest"" which irked me, as they then blame the driver skill as the only possible explanation and hounded him on it.\n\nAt least some of this talk wasn\'t in good faith, though, (IMO a lot of Lando criticism last year was not in good faith but that\'s for another discussion) and just being done because he was fighting against Max. The objective was to make Lando look as bad as possible (and worse than he was) and not to offer objective criticism.', ""You're not wrong about Verstappen being the best on the grid and that he might have squeezed out slightly more pace...but a tenth wouldn't have been nearly enough to make a difference...the two things that typically held McLaren back more than anything were Norris' starts, which perhaps Max would have done better, however that's inconclusive because Piastri also had start issues despite that never having been a problem for him (and they were never a problem of Lando's before this year either...which makes you think there may have been something problematic from a technical perspective there), and straight line speed/DRS, which is by far the most important thing.\n\nAn extra tenth of pace while following another car in dirty air wouldn't have been all that significant if you're already faster on average than the car ahead but dont have the straight line advantage to overtake."", 'Agreed']",19,16,0.77,19,14,14,19,16,0.77,19
