1kkr2e5,Court documents appear to confirm Peter de Putron is Williams' real owner,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kkr2e5/court_documents_appear_to_confirm_peter_de_putron/,2025-05-12, Discussion,"A few years ago, the F1 journalist Joe Saward wrote [an article](https://joesaward.wordpress.com/2022/05/31/green-notebook-from-solarium-beach/) in which he identified Peter de Putron, an extremely reclusive financier and investor, as the ultimate owner of the Williams F1 team. Saward wrote:

>Back in the summer of 2020, when the Williams team was sold to Dorilton Capital, there was much interest and speculation about who was behind the mysterious investment firm. It was based in New York, but was clearly not an American firm. It was identified only as being a private investment office for an unidentified high worth family.

>I got a tip that the buyer was a Jersey-based entrepreneur called Peter de Putron, but no-one in the team would talk about whether these stories were true. De Putron is so reclusive that there does not seem to be a single photograph of him on the Internet, which makes it quite hard to identify him. ‚Ä¶

>Anyway, to cut a long story short I am certain that de Putron is the man behind Dorilton ‚Äì and I‚Äôll not post any pictures of him because he does not want to be famous.

Saward is a divisive character and it seems some people were suspicious as the source of his 'tip', but I recently came across a [court transcript](https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/other-courts/2025/2025-ny-slip-op-30605-u.html) which does appear to prove him right. These court documents relate to an [ongoing lawsuit](https://archive.is/97mXe) brought by Williams' former marketing director, Claudia Schwartz, against [James Matthews](https://www.williamsf1.com/team/james-matthews), another financier and Williams board member (and Pippa Middleton's husband, if you're interested in that sort of thing).

Schwartz's lawyers (based on, among things, testimony from Jost Capito, Williams' former team principal), reveal that:

* de Putron approves (or at least approved) all budgets for Williams Grand Prix Engineering
* Capito was told never to use de Putron's name in discussions about Williams, being informed by the board that ""Peter De Putron is in the background and doesn‚Äôt want to be known or seen that he‚Äôs the owner of Williams""
* Despite this, de Putron is referred to as ""ODL"" (Our Dear Leader) internally
* de Putron is publicly the owner of another Williams-related company, Williams IP Holdings LLC
* The plaintiffs (Dorilton and Williams) tried to prevent de Putron's name being revealed by arguing he is merely ‚Äúan outside investor‚Äù and not the owner

They further conclude that de Putron makes ""all significant decisions‚Äù for both Dorilton Capital Management and Williams Grand Prix Engineering.

The court documents are [freely available](https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/other-courts/2025/2025-ny-slip-op-30605-u.html) if you want to dive in further.

De Putron himself seems like an interesting and well-connected character with all kinds of links to politicians and various high-flyers. He is the brother in law of Andrea Leadsom, the former UK health minister, and was at Wharton business school with Matthew Savage, the founder of Dorilton.

It should be noted that Dorilton denies de Putron being involved with Williams in any way, despite Jost Capito's testimony.","[""It's been a minute since we've had a genuine mystery man in F1 at such a high level.

Most people aren\'t going back and actually watching races from the 70s or 80s, or reading detailed reports, they\'re reading wikipedia and going ""he got X titles and Y wins so is great"" missing all context.\n\nTherefore I feel I can only accurately comment on championships I\'ve watched, which is basically everyone from Hakkinen onwards in 1998, which within the GOAT conversation is limited to Schumacher, Hamilton, and Verstappen as I don\'t think there\'s much argument for the likes of Kimi or Button to be considered GOATs.\n\nI think Schumacher is fairly ranked, often #1, almost always top 3-5. \n\nI also think Hamilton is fairly ranked, also often #1 and also almost always top 3-5. This ranking will settle when he retires.\n\nI do think Verstappen is grossly overrated within this debate largely due to recency bias. He\'s the current champion, the one people see as being unbeatable, he took down the great Hamilton, and his fans are incredibly active on social media meaning any question of him being the GOAT is seen as a hate crime and you\'re hounded accordingly. I think there are questions around his wheel-to-wheel racing ability; almost every time he\'s actually challenged on track he resorts to some dirty tactic that leads to a rule clarification or steward involvement. Folk in 2022 and 2023 forgot what he was like as he was up front and not challenged, and it was only when he was pushed by McLaren in 2024 he resorted to his usual tactics. I\'d like to see him win a championship cleanly. 2021 is an obvious one really, multiple reasons why that counts against him. He\'s never had a decent teammate to challenge him either, and hasn\'t won with multiple teams. \n\nPeople reading that last paragraph will assume I\'m trying to say ""Max is a bad driver"" or ""Max sucks"" or something else that fits their narrative which couldn\'t be further from the truth. Max is incredibly talented, but after a while you have to stop looking purely at numbers. All the greats have data and statistics to back up their claims, but it\'s the other stuff that moves you from being ""multiple WDC who will go down in history as an all time great"" to being ""arguably the greatest person to ever sit in an F1 car"", and it\'s moving from that first phase, a solid 9/10 driver, to the latter, a 10/10 that he\'s currently lacking.']",3,19,0.67,3,18,18,3,12,0.17000000000000004,3
