This meant that he tumbled down the live timing tower, making it seem like he had issues. He didn't, the car was still going perfectly fine, so all the broadcasters removed the timing tower from the broadcast to avoid making people think he had retired.\n\nFortunately, F1 has a backup optical timing system on the start-finish straight to make sure that they can get correct race results even if a transponder fails. After a bit of work from the various broadcasters' technical teams, they were able to replace the timing tower using the results from this end-of-lap timing. Of course, that only updates once per lap, so it would have been pretty heavily delayed at certain points.\n\nNow for DRS: as you probably know, DRS can only be activated if you're within 1 second of the car ahead. George Russell didn't know if he was within 1 second of the car ahead, because he doesn't have timing. But also the car *behind him* doesn't know if they're within 1 second, because the car ahead doesn't have timing. So both RUS and whoever was behind him didn't have automatic DRS, and had to override it in order to be able to use it. This is why RUS was able to accidentally activate his DRS.\n\nNone of this was an issue with the broadcasts themselves, and honestly the broadcast teams did really well to compensate for it given that the data they ordinarily use for timings simply was not accurate."", 'Great race from Haas.

1jyvviz,Should there be an F1 Manufacturers' Trophy?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jyvviz/should_there_be_an_f1_manufacturers_trophy/,2025-04-14, Discussion,"Question in title.

For context, F1 currently has two leaderboards: the World Drivers' Championship for the racers, and the World Constructors' Championship for the teams, who build their own cars.

What i'm proposing is a leaderboard for the manufacurers of the cars' engines, their power units, as most teams don't make their own. Formula E, the other open-wheel world championship, already has its own Manufacturers' Trophy.

There are a number of ways to implement it, but i would suggest a modified version of the Formula E system (see [section 6 of their rulebook](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/2024-2025_fia_formula_e_world_championship_-_sporting_regulations_12.12.2024_-_clean.pdf)): 3 best results per power unit maker per race. If you're not among the top 3 of your power unit maker (e.g. Honda), the points go to the next best driver who is eligible fot MT points (e.g. Ferrari). Points are on the same scale as WDC and WCC, excluding any Pole and FL points.

For example, in the system i'm proposing, while there was only one Mercedes factory driver on the podium this year at Bahrain, all three podium results would count towards Mercedes' MT standing, since Piastri and Norris both used Mercedes engines in their McLaren cars. 

So, what do you think? Do you think F1 should have it? If how, how do you think it should be implemented?","['No. Next question.', 'Participation trophies?  No.\nWhere does it stop?\n\n Tyre manufacturers trophy?', 'Could only be implemented if there was an actual balance of PU distribution across the grid, which there isn’t close to.

1jypinn,Verstappen is what you get when you fuse senna and Prost together,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jypinn/verstappen_is_what_you_get_when_you_fuse_senna/,2025-04-14, Discussion,"Today he caught that slight overstep by Lando in the grid box, last year he and a very few others knew the proper start procedure in Brazil, it feels like he is constantly giving feed back about rules of engagement and the proper way to go wheel to wheel based on the rules. 

They’ve even had to change rules because of him, remember his safety car restarts in 2021, he knew the rule and he knew exactly how much he could push the limits without breaking it to give himself the advantage 

It calls to mind Prost and how he would make sure any rule infringement, even if it was very slight, was punished

But beyond that max has the raw speed and talent of senna, he’s not afraid to attack and seize any tiny gap he sees in a race, even if it risk a crash, not to mention he’s the best wet race driver we’ve seen since senna (he may even be better)

1jypmia,Realistic Options for Max?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jypmia/realistic_options_for_max/,2025-04-14, Discussion,"Before the season I think Max could have chosen any team. But three races in, I feel like the options are very limited for a future WDC.
Mercedes- no. George/Kimi seem locked. If Mercedes gets 2026 right, George/Kimi are easily favorites for multiple WDCs and WCCs.
McLaren- maybe. Lando’s seat could be vulnerable but does Zack want to deal with Jos? I think McLaren is set with Piastri rising and Lando accepting number 2 responsibilities and that gives McLaren multiple WDC and WCC potential.
Ferrari - no. I don’t think Max believes the hype and I don’t think he has the brand nostalgia of wanting to be a Ferrari driver.
Aston- yes. This seems like the only real option. Reunion with Newey, three years of Nando feedback, and Stroll and Jos seem like they could get along. 
Perhaps this is behind the frustration, because the options quickly became stay with RB without Newey or full Honda support or gamble with AM.
