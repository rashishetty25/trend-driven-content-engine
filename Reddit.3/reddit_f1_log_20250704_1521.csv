If this development is confirmed, Alpine\'s Formula 1 adventure will have lasted only five seasons.\n\nAnother major change: Renault has definitively ended its engine development for 2026. The Enstone team will now rely on a partnership with Mercedes to use their future V6 turbo hybrid. If the German engine proves successful, Renault will no longer be able to hide behind engine problems.\n\nOn the management front, uncertainty persists.

1lqxjq4,[AMuS] McLaren now also top in top speed,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lqxjq4/amus_mclaren_now_also_top_in_top_speed/,2025-07-03, News,,"['Rob Marshall really did some magic in that car\n\nHe really is 1 half of the real genius behind RB19 with Adrian Newey', '*Next technical tricks?* \n\nTranslation:\n\n> **McLaren has the best car in the field. And thanks to upgrades, it\'s getting better and better. The third part of a major package is set to arrive at Silverstone. This means McLaren is suddenly also at the top of the top speed ladder.**\n\n> McLaren isn\'t letting up. They already have a 207-point lead over Ferrari in the Constructors\' Championship. And Max Verstappen would need to win two races, with both McLaren drivers retiring, to get back within striking distance. Nevertheless, McLaren was in the middle of a three-stage technical upgrade at the Red Bull Ring.\n\n> There\'s a method to this at McLaren. Since it\'s becoming increasingly difficult to find lap times with these cars, and since the competition is increasingly struggling with the side effects of excessive development steps, McLaren prefers to take the cautious approach. The engineering department rolls out the upgrades in small portions. This way, you can quickly see whether you\'re on the right track. And if you don\'t hit the mark, the responsible part is quickly identified.\n\n> Last year, following the car\'s complete overhaul in Miami, the subsequent upgrades were split into two stages each. The first took place in Zandvoort and Monza, the second in Austin and Mexico City. The latest development phase of the MCL39 is a three-stage project: the front wing, rear wing, and front axle in Montreal; the brake vents and front wishbones, a chassis modification, and the rear axle in Spielberg. The upgrade is expected to be completed by Silverstone.\n\n> **More efficiency, more feeling.**\nIn Austria, McLaren was surprisingly open about its efforts to increase the gap to its rivals. The front wing from Montreal, along with the brake vents, chassis cosmetics, and wishbone fairings on the front axle, forms a package that makes the front of the car more aerodynamically efficient, resulting in more grip and less drag. It has been hinted that similar measures will follow at the rear.\n\n> The modifications to the front axle geometry in Montreal were solely aimed at giving the drivers a better feel for the tire\'s grip under braking. Lando Norris gratefully accepted the gift. Oscar Piastri returned to the old version. ""This isn\'t an upgrade in the true sense,"" explains team principal Andrea Stella, ""but more like a tuning tool. The drivers can decide whether they want it or not.""\n\n> **Are the rear axle and top speed related?**\nThe most interesting detail of McLaren\'s technological offensive is the rear suspension. The focus here was primarily on the kinematics, which stabilizes an already good aerodynamic platform. Neil Houldey, one of three technical directors at McLaren, explained in Spielberg that they had taken some inspiration from the competition and were following a trend set by others.\n\n> The McLaren veteran declined to go into detail. However, one can imagine that McLaren is now also using the ""lowering device"" that lowers the car\'s ride height to the desired level above a certain load, thus ensuring that downforce remains stable. ""The new suspension gives the car more stability at corner entry,"" reveals Houldey.\n\n> According to teams using such a system, another advantage is the higher top speed. Combined with the changes to the front end, this could help the McLarens on the straights. Until Montreal, the papaya-yellow cars were always ranked in the bottom third of the field in terms of top speed. In Spielberg, Norris and Piastri were suddenly ahead in all speed measurements, both in the race and in qualifying.\n\n> **Modular kit with aero options.**\nHouldey reveals another interesting consequence of the latest development steps. ""We\'ve found general performance, but now we also have a modular system of different aerodynamic options that we can combine depending on the track or the drivers\' preferences. Some things bring advantages on certain tracks, less so on others. If you choose them correctly, this leads to further time savings.""\n\n> Stella sums it all up simply: ""We\'ve succeeded in making a good car even better."" Who can beat McLaren?', 'Remember when people genuinely thought the front wing TD would nerf them? Pepperidge Farm remembers', 'The fuckers apparently fixed their one weakness, goddamn', 'Not massively surprising. The best car is normally fucking quick in a straight line because it can survive running less aero', ""I like AMuS and their technical explanations, but this article is backed up by almost no data. It would've been nice to see the results over a few races to see if maybe there is anything to it. A single race isn't enough to say if they are the fastest in top-speed. Maybe I'll do an article to see if there is evidence of McLaren gaining in the top-speed department.\xa0"", ""At this point probably a good thing for the entertainment, if they are guaranteed to finish 1-2 every race we'll have a fight in an otherwise boring season at least"", 'I would have guessed they would focus on bringing back the high speed rear stability they‚Äôve always had but it was a bit lacking with this car and a bit with the 2024 car.

He has 3 drivers who are all great for different reasons. But he only has 2 seats. And all 3 of the potential line ups have negatives and positives

Max/George is negative in that the team may have a civil war, positive in that great results are virtually garunteed.

Max/Kimi is negative in that there is a high risk of Kimi going the same way as countless Max team mates and losing all confidence but positive in that IF it works you've got a good plan for the future.

George/Kimi is negative in that you are refusing one of the best drivers of all time but positive in that you maintain good vibes and stability in the team. 

The only way I can think of Merc no ending up in a scenario where they lose at least one driver is if Kimi can be loaned to another team. 

A perfect team would be Alpine. They'll have Mercedes emgines next year and have only one seat locked down for 2026. Furthermore they showed that they are willing to take loans when they accepted Colapinto frim Williams on loan. And Kimi is an even better deal. 

Of course Alpine could refuse or Kimi could refuse to stay a Mercedes owned driver.
