1jq3dmz,Equipe Ligier: The Ups and Downs of the first ever French Team to win a Grand Prix,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jq3dmz/equipe_ligier_the_ups_and_downs_of_the_first_ever/,2025-04-02, Throwback,"This story begins with two friends, Guy Ligier and Jo Schlesser, both of them were avid race car drivers who had a dream, the dream od creating their own car brand and sports team, but those dreams seemed to shatter when Jo Schlessee perished on the 1968 French Grand Prix while driving the infamous Honda RA302, which John Surtees deemed a deathtrap, when his car lost control and the magnesium chassis burnt into flames. Guy decided that nothing would stop him from making his and Jo's dream come true, so he created Ligier Automotive, and as a tribute to his late friend, every car the team built had the initial JS as a tribute to his late friend.

Ligier jumped into the thriving world of F1 in 1976, which seemed a risky decision, but he signed a promising driver named Jacques Laffite to take the wheel of their first ever F1 car, the JS5, and also signed an exclusivity deal with Matra, after taking their F1 team assets, things seemed to go on a very good way, they got their first pole at the Italian Grand Prix and they also got three podiums finishing a respectable 6th ppace in the Constructors Championship with 20 points, even though 1977 went a bit more sour, they got their first ever win, and the first for an all French team in F1 history at the Swedish Grand Prix.

1978 was another solid year with podiums but no wins, but there came the ground effect, and with that, their best car, the JS11, they started the season with 2 straight wins of Laffite in Argentina and Brazil, and after signing a second driver in Patrick Depailler, winning the Spanish Grand Prix and leading the championship after Monaco, Ligier was looking to get it all, but Depailler broke his legs in a gliding accident and had to retire from the season. Reliability also killed all chances from getting a championship, as did Depailler replacement, Jacky Ickx, who wasn't able toget the grips on the car. Ligier finished that year 3rd in Constructors, with Laffite 4th and Depailler 6th even after missing half of the season.

By 1980, they signed Didiee Pironi as Ickx's replacement, and even though Laffite didn't like having a teammate, the car was solid and they garnered 2 wins and a 2nd place in Constructors (P.S. by 1979 they swapped to Ford after Matra gave poor results). In 1981 even though Laffite was the only competitive driver, he had a small chance of getting the championship at the last round in Las Vegas, and he ended up just 6 points behind champion Nelson Piquet. 

But suddenly, from 1982 to 1984, Ligier suffered a deep downward dive in performance, going pointless in 1983, only scoring a few podiums in 1982 and also losing their star driver Laffite, but in 1985 the team had new Renault engines that were powerful enough to make that car fight for points and podiums again, and in 1986 everything seemed to be going right into place, Laffite returned in 1985 and Rene Arnoux signed also for them, the duo looked strong and were consistent points and podiums contenders, but in the British GP in Brands Hatch, a massive crash ensued and Laffite broke both of his legs, ending his long career in F1 and leaving Ligier devastated, as they had lost their top driver. From 1987 to 1992 nothing seemed to work on the small French team, their performance was worse and worse as the seasons went on, they even weren't able to qualify in certain races. 

The morale was on the floor, but suddenly, in 1993, they were able to make a car solid enough and with good drivers such as Martin Brundle and Mark Blundell, they were able to finish on the podium a few times, and get enough points to get the team up to 5th in the Constructors Championship, and they were also the best team with a passive suspension that year, compared to the top teams who used an active suspension. 

By 1995, Ligier was able to sign a deal with Mugen Honda as their engine suppliers, but of course, with that came Aguri Suzuki as their driver along with Olivier Panis. During the season Brundle and Suzuki swapped seats for certain races, with Brundle even scoring a podium, the team put another solid season and finished 5th in Constructors again. In 1996, things seemed grim for the team as they were going to shut down after that season, but they were able to leave with a last hurrah with the miraculous win of Olivier Panis on the crazy Monaco GP where he got the first win for Ligier in 15 years, and of course the team's top driver, Jacques Laffite was there for the celebration aswell. At last, they closed the season with a respectable 6th place in the Constructors Championship with 15 points. And so ends the tale of the Equipe Ligier with 9 wins, 50 podiums and 9 poles, a remarkable tale that begun with two friends wanting to create a car brand and ended up with one of the most beloved teams in F1 history.","[""I'm surprised you totally skipped over the whole reunion with Renault that both caused their brief upswing in 1993 and the vulture-like Briatore by-out, as well as the constant failed negotiations with Prost that started as far back as his Ferrari days as those were what really sealed the team's fate. The team's brief spell as a Lambourghini customer was an interesting chapter too."", 'That was a great read mate. Thank you for putting the effort and not just posting a ""here is my Ligier livery if they were in F1"" type stuff.', 'My favorite Ligier story was how the JS11 had way too much downforce from its ground effect that it needed to ""cheat"" with a series of flaps (dubbed the *clapet*, french for ""valve"") in both its venturi tunnels that would open at a certain pressure. The team went to great efforts to hide this that their actions raised the suspicions of Giorgio Piola. Luckily for the latter, a chance to see what was going on opened up when one of the cars crashed at the final race of the 1980 season at Watkins Glen. Back then, the garages were some distance from the pits, so when the car was brought there, Piola ran as fast as he could to snap photos of the venturis before the team, most of whom were coming from trackside, could cover them up with towels. On the way back, Piola saw Ligier designer Gerard Ducarouge and gave a thumbs up at him, indicating that he caught what they were doing. According to Piola, Ducarouge apparently hated his guts after this.\n\nPiola talks about this in this video with Autosport. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zVD34wK-Q', 'Here’s my Ligier Matra story..

The pits were a no go zone general admission wouldn’t get you in.  \n\nThe track was laid out then that the pits were on Ocean blvd which had several apartment buildings. Residents were inside the track so we entered in the back door of one of the apartments walked up two flights of stairs and out the front door into the pits.. \n\nOther than ticket guys at the pit gate security was non existent, we were literally walking around the pits mingling with the mechanics and drivers.

I was confused that over the winter in here that there was a bit of a narrative forming that because he had a poor end to the year (which is quite overstated) that he wasnt a championship tier driver and wouldnt get close to Lando.\xa0\n\nLike the same people were saying after the 7 race stretch from Austria to Baku where he was the best driver on the grid bar Max, that he would be champion this year and would beat Lando in the championship in 2024.\xa0\n\nHe’s only starting his third year of F1 and is improving at an alarming rate. In 2023 he was criticised for his struggles at tyre management. Since mid 2024 he hasn’t had a problem with it.

Since mid 2024 he hasn’t had a problem with it.\n\nThere were still severaal races, especially in the back half of 2024, where his race pace was really lacking comapred to Lando. One of the main reasons for this was his lack of tyre management.\n\n>He’s literally outqualified every team mate he’s ever had including peak 2019 Sainz in his rookie year. \n\nThere is no indication that 2019 was Sainz\' ""peak"". He\'s just gotten to his best form from 2023 onwards imo if you compare him to Leclerc, who has also improved.', 'Nowhere in the initial comment OP mentions about people in either of the 2 categories. \n\nNo idea how you came to the above conclusion.', 'Ok interesting points. Ones I disagree with but interesting all the same\n\nWhich races did he struggle at tyre management in the back half of 2024? You see while theres a correlation between struggling with tyres and lack of pace I don’t think it’s a causation.\n\nOf the races in the back end of last year where he wasnt close to Lando there were other reasons than tyre management. And some he was really close to Lando in.\xa0\n\nUSA - Only around 5 seconds of Lando\xa0\n\nMexico - recovering from qualifying P16\xa0\n\nBrazil -\xa0\xa012 seconds off Lando who is better in the wet (one of Piastri’s few weak areas) before 5 second penalty.\xa0\n\nLas Vegas - Only around 5 seconds off Lando\xa0\n\nQatar - Beat Lando\xa0\n\nAbu Dhabi - Got taken out on lap 1\xa0\n\nSo he wasn’t really particularly struggling on tyres in these races.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nAnd now for Sainz’s 2019 season. In my opinion it is the best season put together by a midfield driver in the last decade. For context in 2019 the top three teams were way ahead of the rest and the best result you could realistically hope for was P7, or P6 of second Red Bull was struggling\xa0\n\nBahrain - Amazing start and is 6th, then he tries to overtake Max for 5th but they touch and Carlos loses his front wing and retires due to crash damage. But that shouldn’t take away from the fact that he was fighting Max Verstappen for fifth in a worse car.\n\nAzerbaijan - finishes P7 after a string race in the points. Second best in midfield behind Baku specialist Perez.\xa0\n\nSpain - finishes 8th after pulling some opportunistic overtakes on Kvyat and Grosjean towards the end.\xa0\n\nMonaco - Goes from 9th on the grid to 6th (best of the rest and joint best result for McLaren in the last year) with a really strong first stint and he makes one of the most unbelievable, underrated double overtakes around the outside of turn 3 on both Toro Rossos on the opening lap.\xa0\n\nFrance - Qualifies seventh gets to sixth at the start and doesn’t relinquish it. P6 and best of the rest again.\n\nAustria - Goes from last row of the grid after grid penalties to 8th place in a great comeback race.\xa0\xa0\n\nBritain - Has a great start to gain two places. Gets into sixth with safety car luck and proceeds to make a great defence of that position against a faster Ricciardo for the last portion of the race. P6 again.\xa0\n\nGermany - Finishes P5 in wet, wild, wonderful race. Had Stroll and Lvya not got lucky with their pit stop gamble when running out of the points them Sainz would have been 3rd!\nMcLarens joint best result of last half a decade.\xa0\n\nHungary - Finishes P5 AGAIN! Holds off a faster Gasly for over 35 laps! Over half the race Carlos held off a Red Bull and he won that battle!\xa0\n\nItaly - was running up in SIXTH place until McLaren left his wheel loose after pit stop.\n\nRussia - Qualifes fifth and has a great start to get ahead of Bottas for fourth. Bottas repasses him before the faster Red Bulls come through ahead. However Vettel retires so Sainz ends up getting 6th place. Again.\n\nJapan - He gets another P5 after another strong Quali, another strong start and finishes 48 SECONDS AHEAD OF THE NEXT BEST MIDFIELD CAR. That is insane.\xa0\n\nMexico - Goes from 7th to 4th at the start before having to do a two stop because of silly Q2 tyre rule where top ten have to qualify on the tyres they started on. This means he is 13th rather than likely 6th.\xa0\n\nBrazil - The best performance of his career. Imo it even beats his magical wins in Singapore, Australia and Mexico.\xa0\nCarlos Sainz goes from 20th and plum last on the grid, to 3RD! In what was perhaps not even one of the top 5 best cars on the grid that day. Yes the top cars made a lot of errors but Sainz had to overtake everyone else on track. Amazing race to get a thoroughly deserved first ever podium.\xa0\n\nAbu Dhabi - Makes two incredible last gasp divebomb overtakes on the Renaults to clinch the point he needed to get him 6th in the drivers championship by one point.\xa0\n\nI think other than Lewis and Max, he was the best driver on the grid that year and it is the best season of his career. He was the best of the rest in almost a third of the races that year with four P6 finishes, three P5 finishes, and a magical podium in Brazil.\xa0\n\nHe came sixth in the championship ahead of two drivers who had spent half their seasons in a Red Bull car far better than Sainz’s.\xa0\n\nHe was over 40 points ahead of the next midfield driver.\xa0\n\n\nI don’t think 2023 and 2024 compare at all. In 2023 Sainz had strong form in Italy and Singapore but they were his first podiums of the season.\xa0\nLeclerc had an insane amount of bad luck and still beat Sainz in the standings.\xa0\n\nAnd mainly, when Ferrari were in a fight for 2nd in the Constructors at the end of the year decided to be absolutely nowhere. In Vegas he spun at the start and worst of all, in Abu Dhabi he gets knocked out in Q1 and eventually retires one lap from the end while running in I think 15th. Meanwhile Leclerc had two of the best races of his career as he tried to get Ferrari 2nd place.\xa0\n\nIn 2024 Sainz had a great start to the year and on his day was great, but he made loads of mistakes that cost Ferrari the championship.\xa0\n\nIn Canada he spun off while running on the edge of the points and took Albon with him. In Singapore he crahsed in qualifying and this ruined not just his, but Leclerc’s lap too at a track they could’ve got a good result at. And In Brazil he crahsed out of both qualifying and the race.\xa0\n\n2019 was peak Sainz.\n\nAmd Ive just spent over an hour writing a Reddit comment hardly anyone will ever read…', 'First time on Reddit?', 'I was being facetious', 'Isn’t that,like, poo?']",88,10,0.88,88,9,9,7,2,0.0,7

You also eliminate the driving on the grass/mud practice, and potential issues from things like water bottle leaks.

So, are there things the teams would do to ""cheat"" if the weigh-in process changed? Especially cheats that would render the whole process useless?

/edit: This is not about any one team, car or driver. More on the the pros/cons of the weigh in timing. I'm not defending or attacking anyone in particular.

/edit2: Lots of examples of dumping liquids or changing parts. Those things would be really obvious and subsequent rules would surely make them much more difficult. The current weighing rules are already very complicated where different things are weighed separately and so forth.
