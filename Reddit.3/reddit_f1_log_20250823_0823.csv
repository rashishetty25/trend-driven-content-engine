1mx3ahx,FIA “surprised” by focus on lap times as it reveals just how slow 2026 F1 cars could be,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mx3ahx/fia_surprised_by_focus_on_lap_times_as_it_reveals/,2025-08-22, News,,"['So Pedro will hold his lap record at Bahrain, not a bad tradeoff', ""if lap times are slower but drivers are not obliged to drive 2 or 3 seconds far from others because of dirty air that's a huge win."", 'The Lego cars had terrible laptimes but the drivers had the most fun ever.', 'Was there ever a time when F1 teams and fans were happy about the regulations?', 'No one is obsessed with lap times exactly, but we don’t want the back of the grid slower than F2.

It's nice to see they all still care so much and were still insightful, all except Mansell felt very engaged and serious in their answers.\n\nThis comment has become a post praising just Prost but he is very detail oriented and clearly a brilliant mind, I love hearing him speak.
