However, as precedent shows, it appears to be the standard penalty for ignoring double yellows during a race. I went through the penalty-points system database which covers the past 10 years, and found all three instances of a breach **during a race**.

* 2021 Austrian GP, Mazepin & Latifi handed penalty post-race, **10s Stop & Go**, which was translated into 30s added to their race time due to the penalty being post race.

These are all examples I could find of drivers ignoring double yellow flags during the race in the last 10 years. All drivers got the same penalty.  If anyone could find examples from before 2014, that would be interesting too.

At least this time, the stewards seem to have been consistent for once.","['Maybe the confusion comes from that it has happened more often during qualifying in recent years and with different penalties for qualifying', ""It's confusing to fans because the broadcast makes no distinction between single and double yellow.  It's just a yellow flag notification and what sector."", 'I actually thought the FIA were right in issuing strict penalties. Their only failure was the wing mirror being let out on the track for so long.\xa0', ""Yup. We haven't seen it in a race in a few years, only really during quali & practices, where it's a 3 place grid drop. And during VSCs and SCs it's a 5 second penalty."", ""Penalty today was fair and consistent\n\nI think the issue actually is that drivethrough and stop and go penalties aren't given often enough. They should be utilised much more for collisions when one driver is clearly at fault instead of standard 5/10s penalties. The only reason the penalty today seemed harsh at first is we basically never see stop and go penalties."", 'There have been very rare instances of ignoring double yellows that not everyone remembers the rules. But what surprised me was that the commentators overreacted to the penalty. Even after the race where they had time to cool down and do a bit of research before the post race presentation, they kept repeating how both the penalties were harsh and FIA has to be blamed.', ""Most people don't care to look details and nuances, they just want to be angry!\n\nThe other talking point of today's race was Lewis's penalty. A drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane seems harsh because they usually give 5-second penalties. But the significant factor in this case is that Lewis was 12.5 km/h over the speed limit, not the usual 0.1 km/h. And a drive-through penalty is the recommended penalty in regulations when you are that much above the speed limit.\n\nFor Lando's case as you said 10-second stop-and-go penalty is standard for not respecting double yellows in the race. I think a lot of people are not paying attention to the fact it was **DOUBLE** yellows not single. Again 10-second stop-and-go penalty is the recommended penalty in the regulation (Bernie Collins confirmed that in post-race) and as you said it's the penalty that has been given in all recent instances.\n\nEdit: I think the broadcast also plays a part in the misunderstanding, firstly they showed the wrong replay in the live broadcast and they just said yellows in the race, didn't say double yellows until post-race."", ""It's a safety issue and a very fair penalty imo, same with the pitlane one"", ""> If anyone could find examples from before 2014, that would be interesting too.\n\nAlonso got a drive through penalty in the 2003 Brazilian GP for overtaking under yellows. I think it was double-waved yellows, but can't find a reference to that right now.

Hamilton can also be heard reporting a puncture while on the pit straight well before reaching the point where the mirror was hit by Bottas. (Please note that on driver cams, the radio is out of sync with the video, but you can tell when radio calls are made by watching the driver toggle the radio on their steering wheel.)

The debris appears to mostly fall on the RIGHT side of the track, off the racing line, and both Sainz and Hamilton report front-LEFT punctures.

Team principal Fred Vasseur believes that his team did everything perfectly over the Lusail weekend and launches the challenge ahead of the Abu Dhabi GP that will close the season. In the press conference following the grand prix, the Frenchman returned to the strategy adopted in the race and then analyzed the possibilities of the Maranello team in view of the last appointment of the year.\n\n**VASSEUR: “THE PLAN WAS TO GO EVEN LONGER AND IT WAS WELL EXECUTED”**\n\nThere was a lot of discussion about the fact that Ferrari was too conservative with its drivers, asking them to take care of keeping tires in the first dozen laps of the Qatar GP. Vasseur rejects the accusations, explaining that the puncture of Carlos Sainz and the subsequent Safety Car changed what were the initial expectations: “The plan was to return even later, since on one car we did the pit-stop because it had a flat, while on the other because the Safety Car had entered the track. But the initial plan was to return even later. I think we will discuss the history of the VSC for a long time before or not, but the plan was to last longer and the reason for Carlos’s drilling is only the debris, not the excessive degradation”.\n\nThe Ferrari team principal believes that even in these conditions the drivers performed everything at their best: “The initial conduct was too conservative if you know you have a Safety Car on lap 25, but the plan was to go a little longer than that and I think it was the right approach because when we decided to push from lap 12/15 the pace was there and I think we expected to do a long stint. Honestly the initial plan was executed very well by the two drivers and they did a great job”.\n\n**THE FINAL FLIGHT WITH THE MCLAREN**\n\nThe Qatar GP on paper was the most difficult appointment for Ferrari in this final triptych of races, but the course of the race allowed the Maranello team to shorten on the McLaren on the Manufacturers’ ranking and at the same time Leclerc to arrive at only 8 lengths from Lando Norris. Vasseur underlines the positive surprise of this weekend, promising battle in the final appointment of Abu Dhabi: “We would have signed before the weekend to score more points than McLaren. We are still alive for the championship and Charles is not far from Norris now. I also think that second place in the overall Pilots’ standings is a good result. I’d rather have 20 points of advantage than 20 of offset, but let’s see. On paper I think the next circuit will probably be a little better for us. We fight until the last curve of the last lap”.\n\nFerrari will show up at Yas Marina with less pressure than McLaren, which instead has everything to lose. Vasseur explained that the Maranello team must continue to focus only on itself, as it has done so far: “It is not a matter of pressure. The important thing is to do a good job and be fast, then we’ll see. First of all you have to focus on yourself. We managed to make 1-2 on weekends during the season, we have to try to do our best to achieve this goal. But it’s true that even if we do 1-2, they can be champions. The most important thing is to focus on yourself, don’t start thinking about what others do. This weekend the approach was very good, because we stayed focused on our strategy without thinking too much about what McLaren or Red Bull were doing. It’s not said that we’ll be in good shape next week in Abu Dhabi, but we’ll have to put everything together. It’s always a challenge, but we will enter Abu Dhabi with enormous motivation”.\n\n**FAR FROM CONTROVERSY**\n\nThe result of the Qatar GP was strongly conditioned by the decisions of the Race Management. Vasseur believes that the discussions on the decisions taken by the stewards are nothing new: “In the last 35 years of my life we have all always complained about the decision of the stewards and the Race Director. Maybe a little less with Charlie (Whiting) for different reasons. But it’s always been like that”.\nThe Ferrari team principal did not want to give a judgment either on the relegation of a position imposed on Max Verstappen on Saturday or on the 10-second stop&go set on Norris on Sunday: “Honestly, I haven’t even seen Saturday’s video, but it’s in the range of penalties to give a penalty position. Same for today, for Lando. It is at their discretion and they can impose this type of penalty. It certainly depends on the severity of the violation, if it was faster than the previous land in that mini sector, but it’s to allow me to focus on Abu Dhabi that I don’t want to start making controversy now. I’ve tried to stay away from every single controversy throughout the season, I won’t start again before the last grand prix”.\n\nThe French manager also pushed away criticism about the performance of his next driver Lewis Hamilton in the second part of this season: “Hamilton? Take a look at the 50 laps he did in Las Vegas starting tenth and finishing in the trail at Russell. I’m not worried at all”. The issue of Guanyu Zhou, approached Ferrari as a test driver next season and the protagonist of an excellent performance in Lusail where he finished eighth, was also liquidated in a few words: “Zhou had a good race. Congratulations. I didn’t argue with him, I’m sorry. I’m focused on my work. But let’s see, let’s see in the future” Vasseur concluded.', 'I did thought that was the plan when Leclerc\'s gap to the front increased fairly quickly and he had Sainz behind on drs for various laps without him saying ""I\'m faster, guys"", it looked a lot like conservative laps.', 'Ferrari WCC and Leclerc runner up in the wdc.', 'Ferrari always gets screwed over in WCC with no fault of their own. Last year the drain covers and now this', 'Ferrari very unlucky. Two years in a row, first with Carlos and the manhole and this year with the debris puncture. Both highly avoidable', 'Zak Brown reminds me of a sleazy used car salesman. Probably because he’s American. So, I relate to your dilemma in a big way.']",290,27,0.98,290,25,25,158,10,0.010000000000000009,158

The gap is 21 points, since McLaren has 640 and Ferrari 619. This is not all the scenarios, but a few to give you a picture of how well Ferrari has to do this weekend, and how bad McLaren has to be. Extra point for fastest lap is not taken into account here, but important not to forget. 

If Ferrari wins the race, a tie on points should also result in win for Ferrari in the constructors due to more wins than McLaren. They are currently tie with 5 wins each. If they end both on tie in points and in number of wins, the number of second places will count, and Mclaren will win constructors.

Thanks!","[""I think the penalties drivers received during the race were appropriate.  We don't often see infractions for speeding in the pitlane as much as Lewis did (10+ kph over) or ignoring double yellows like Lando, so it can be easy to forget what the penalties for those infractions look like.\n\nWhat I don't think was appropriate was the race director's decision to just cover a piece of debris on track with a double yellow and seemingly no plan to clean it up until it was actually hit and started causing damage to cars.\n\nIf nobody hit that mirror, were we just going to go the rest of the race with a double yellow on that track's only real passing zone?  Was that actually the plan?"", 'I’m thinking about the 2025 intro and how weird to see some in different colors, new faces, and Hülkenberg not in the same spot of the theme song for the 3rd year in a row (Will finish 10th or 11th)', 'I keep seeing misinformation about other drivers not lifting for the double yellows, especially the Ferraris, and people calling for them to get penalties.

His throttle usage in lap 30 is identical to lap 29. \n\nThere\'s also a post making waves on Twitter using the lap 31 telemetry as ""proof,"" but the lap that was penalized was lap 30.\n\nThe penalty Norris received is consistent with previous ones for ignoring double yellows in a race.\n\nThat being said... there needs to be a discussion about how terrible the debris was handled. First of all, why was the yellow flag removed six times before the double yellows were instated? Why were the double yellows instated then removed when the situation on track didn\'t change? Why didn\'t they even attempt to recover the debris? I understand that it wasn\'t on the racing line, but it was at the only overtaking corner on the entire track.

Entertaining, but a mess. \n\nFirst of all it's so interesting how big of a difference lifting parc ferme after the sprint has made to my enjoyment of sprint weekends. It solved one of my biggest issues last season, with the race basically being a foregone conclusion after knowing all of the teams racepace from the sprint. Now the setup changes can completely flip the top teams around again. In this case it meant that Red Bull went from slower than a Haas on Saturday, to winning on merit on the Sunday. Also a nice showcase just how important finding the right setup is. \n\nNow onto the race direction/stewards decisions. I still really do not understand what happend with the Max grid drop. I'm a bit afraid of the precedent that the stewards have set with it, and I'm not looking forward to people like Alonso and Max exploiting it in the future. \n\nThat mirror probably should've been a VSC a lot earlier. It was also a bit of a mess with the yellow flags. I'm not really sure I like the FIAs explanation but the top 3 during the presser said that it happens more often with debris off the racing line. As far as I know we haven't had confirmation from Ferrari and Mercedes that the debris caused there punctures, but if it did that really screwed over both Lewis and Carlos. \n\nI was a bit surprised at seeing the 10sSG and the DT penalties, but after reading some posts here yesterday apparently those were in line with earlier precedent so I can't actually complain too much about that."", 'Another great performance from Gasly. He had a  bit of a slow start to the season but he’s been really on it since ~Spain. His performance relative to Ocon this season has been every bit as good, if not better than what Alonso managed across 2021-2022. He might even sneak inside my top five drivers this season.', ""The mirror debris really provides a ton of cover for another huge failure of a weekend from Pirelli, when tire compounds are such a huge factor in making F1 racing interesting. Tire deg was hardly a worry on the opening stint of medium, just when they would fail (as they did on two cars. Then the Hard tire was just mediocre enough to provide no meaningful advantage over a medium with 30 laps wear, while the soft was completely worthless. It certainly doesn't help that the final turn in Lusail couldn't be built better to create 6 tenth gaps between F1 cars, but I haven't seen many races just shut down like this one did after Mercedes slow pit stop and Russell not being able to do anything about the midfield traffic at the end of the stint. The extra laps of follow the leader from the saturday sprint certainly didn't help my impression on the weekend, but something needs to change for '25."", ""Spent a lot of time watching track maps and onboards today on the mirror saga. Here are my takes:\n\n* Unless there was already carbon fiber bits on the track, Sainz's puncture is unrelated to the mirror. Sainz was complaining on radio before he got on to the straight. \n* Lewis definitely hit debris from mirror. I think his front left wasn't in the best condition and as soon as it hit that part of track, Lewis felt the vibration and was on radio even before the 1st turn. \n\n* Bottas caused a lot of unintended mayhem, just because he was being lapped. When he hit the mirror, he wasn't racing. He was moving over for Charles. He didn't hit it with his tyre but rather his car's underbody scooped it up. Interestingly Bottas didn't feel anything like a hit. Nor did his pitwall say anything. He did the lap after hitting it, just like the one before with his engineer giving him basic updates. \n\n* Lando not noticing flags seems to be a combination of: his engineer started talking on the radio, just before the flags and the signalling post before the flags being a basic yellow. Max noticed it because he was in clear air and from his onboard, he has like a couple seconds more to notice it. \n\n* I didn't follow it very well but it seems like GP made Max aware of the ground Lando has made up on him with DRS (DRS he got I think by lapping Bottas). Max who did lift for double yellows immediately put 2 and 2 together. \n\n* In my opinion, there were 2 large enough gaps to VSC and get the mirror away. Front 3 had a decent gap to Kmag and there was a gap between Lewis and Gasly I think. The way I read the track map, in each case the front car was about to exit the straight and back car hadn't turned the final corner. The space was there for 2 full laps. Afterwards, I think people upped their speed expecting a safety car and the gap closed up. \n\n* Nobody actually responded to George about why he got put on hards. He yelled it on the radio and his engineer didn't acknowledge it. Just went on giving more diff and balance recommendations. George, to his credit, out his head down as soon as he realised the team wasn't gonna respond.""]",32,98,0.86,32,91,91,4,5,-0.010000000000000009,4

Not directly in the race, but for example, at the next race, 5 teams discuss among themselves and announce that they will no longer compete if a certain race director will manage that race?

I ask because it is not uncommon in interviews to hear a team principal saying something along the lines of ""we're wrong (or we think we weren't wrong) but the decision is up to the stewards, and we will comply with it"".

So, tldr;

(thank you for all the details)

1. **Concorde Agreement Obligations**:
   * Teams are contractually obligated under the Concorde Agreement to compete in all scheduled races. Non-compliance could result in severe penalties, including exclusion from Formula 1.
2. **Financial Repercussions**:
   * The Formula One Management (FOM) can withhold prize money if teams fail to meet their obligations. This could lead to financial instability for all but the wealthiest teams.
3. **Sponsorship Dependencies**:
   * Sponsors expect teams to participate in every race. Non-compliance with FIA rules could harm sponsorship deals and revenue streams.
4. **Potential Bans and Exclusion**:
   * FIA holds the authority to ban teams from future races or exclude them from championships for non-compliance.
5. **Limited Power Against FIA**:
   * Teams have minimal influence over FIA decisions, which ensures a consistent governing authority.
6. **Judicial Alternatives**:
   * Teams have the right to appeal FIA decisions to bodies like the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). However, this process respects the FIA’s governance framework.
7. **Public and Competitive Image**:
   * Opposing the FIA publicly could harm a team's reputation among fans, sponsors, and peers, creating long-term negative impacts.","[""> Not directly in the race, but for example, at the next race, 5 teams discuss among themselves and announce that they will no longer compete if a certain race director will manage that race?\n\nTeams have to participate in races.

Curious to get theories about the performance difference of Hamilton vs.Russell this year. 

Last year Hamilton won fairly clearly, the year before it was more mixed but this year has been a bit of a mess for Hamilton. 

Keen to get some knowledgable input about what’s this been caused by: 

- fluke results the last few races?
- Hamilton performance dropping off?
- Russell under-rated?
- Something different with the cars? 

Thoughts? 

","[""George is a very good qualifier, so any woes that Hamilton experiences gets highlighted even more so.\n\nHamilton has probably lost of a bit of ultimate one lap pace.\n\nHe doesn't seem to have any confidence in the car.
