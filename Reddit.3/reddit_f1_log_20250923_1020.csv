1nnmk9j,A look at 2025 McLaren's dominance in a world without Max Verstappen,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nnmk9j/a_look_at_2025_mclarens_dominance_in_a_world/,2025-09-22, Statistics,"I wanted to see how dominant the MCL38 really is. Normally you‚Äôd compare its results to the F2004, RB7, W11, RB19‚Äîbut those teams weren‚Äôt challenged by the grid‚Äôs best driver in a weaker car, and that‚Äôs making the field seem closer to McLaren than it really is. So I asked: how dominant would MCL38 be if Verstappen fucked off to race GT cars this season?

I compared the best-performing McLaren (Oscar or Lando) each GP against the field, then re-ran the numbers with Verstappen removed. The difference is highlighted at the bottom. (Extreme outliers that skewed the averages are removed in the ‚Äòfinal‚Äô numbers.)

**TL;DR**

* **Avg. quali margin:** ‚Äì0.106s ‚Üí ‚Äì0.187s without Max (**77% difference**). McLaren now has 14 poles.
* **Avg. race margin:** ‚Äì7.727s ‚Üí ‚Äì12.453s (**61% difference**). McLaren now has 15 wins.
* **Avg. fast lap margin:** ‚Äì0.241s ‚Üí ‚Äì0.304s (**26% difference**). Same total fastest laps.
* **Points:** 623 ‚Üí 666 (**+7%**) (likely the least meaningful stat of the bunch)

*Take from that what you will. Obviously, this is not an exact science, but interesting data nonetheless. The only thing I know for sure we‚Äôd be bored to tears without Max this year. If people are interested, I‚Äôll compare these numbers to other dominant cars once the season‚Äôs over.*","['I mean yeah the top team would look even better if you take the best other competitor out of the equation, you can do this with any sport. This doesn\'t really show ""how dominant the McLaren *really* is"", it shows the season without Verstappen.\n\nThis also assumes that McLaren was faster than RB in all of the races they lost to him and thats not really true. Monza and Baku faster than MCL and imo equal in Imola.', ""I know it's a very big IIF but.........\n\n\nIf max somehow manages to win the championship from this far back this year he will become THE greatest of all time"", ""Now imagine if that same McLaren was being driven by Max, which would compound it's already big advantage.\n\n\nWe'd be talking about how it's one of the most dominant cars of all time or perhaps the most dominant ever, just like the RB19. Even if there have been cars, even in the recent past, with a greater pace advantage to the rest of the field."", 'Right and Albon would win every race if no one else was on the grid.', ""It's not that dramatic. Apart from Imola, Monza and Baku, the gaps are mostly consistent with reality (race pace)."", ""Do not get me wrong Max is the best driver on the grid by some margin & is probably the GOAT (or will be when all is said and done).\n\nBut the fact they keep sticking unproven drivers from midfield next to him year after year really has been amazing for his legacy and reputation. \n\nThey, more often than not, have 0 podiums and 1 or 2 seasons experience. We can see after this weekend with Piastri, even the prodigies are not the finished article when they have done only a year or 2 of F1.\n\nIt's easy to understand why some drivers push for this if they are able to."", ""It also ignores that RBR wouldn't just roll out another midfield driver in that seat, they'd be going after a top driver who may not be as fast as max but would certainly be competitive in a clearly capable car."", ""With the benefit of 24 races though.\n\nIt would be crazy, but he wouldn't have had a chance to come back decades ago as the season would already have been over by now."", 'The goat debate is the most useless and harmful in any sport, I wish at least F1 fans would stop with that bs.', 'Last capable driver next to him was probably Albon 2019 which was also the last time a Red Bull driver got satisfactory results']",75,13,0.73,75,74,74,6,0,0.010000000000000009,6

Even I had my doubts on him finishing in the podium but I am so ecstatic to see how wrong I was\n\nLittle note to add on: the drivers who finished in the Top 5 did exceptionally well this race in terms of defense, management and Antonelli and Lawson's cases, put up formidable fights against each other.

Hopefully this was a one off and he can get back to form for the last few races (cannot deal with a repeat of last year haha), at least Piastri having one of the worst weekends ever takes the heat off him lol.

Yeah.... that lasted a bit longer than an hour. \n\nWith the chaos of qualifying behind us, I expected more chaos in the race, that didn't really happen. I guess it shows the difference between drivers pushing the limits on low fuel vs taking a bit of margin with race management on higher fuel loads.\n\nMcLaren had an absolute disaster weekend. In two race weekends Verstappen somehow gained 35 points on Piastri. This has to be the worst weekend of Piastri's career. Quite frankly it was shockingly bad. Crash in qualifying, false start and crash immediately afterwards in the race. Lando somehow didn't capitalize on that. Partly because he messed up his own lap in qualifying by touching the wall. He didn't have a great start and got overtaken by Hadjar. Proceeded to nap on the race restart and got overtaken by Leclerc as well. After that Lando was basically stuck in the Tsunoda train, which later on became the Lawson train. He would've gotten in front if not for another disaster pitstop. I really want to say it can't get much worse than this, but I've cursed Ferrari with sentences like that before so I won't.\n\nRed Bull with an actual solid weekend with both drivers! Most importantly, from FP1 Max was happy with the balance. This is a huge if, but if Red Bull manages to address their balance issues on higher downforce circuits as well with their new approach, we could have some more McLaren vs Red Bull battles on track. And I'll never say no to more teams fighting it out for the win.\n\nLawson and Sainz both with redemption weekends. I can only praise them for delivering in a difficult qualifying session. \n\nAlbon can go in the shocker category together with Piastri. The botched overtake on Colapinto was just not it.

1no6gqu,Anthony Davidson points to reason for Oscar Piastri Baku crash,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1no6gqu/anthony_davidson_points_to_reason_for_oscar/,2025-09-23, News,,"['> What I believe happens here is that he‚Äôs got Hulkenberg in front of him, trying to make a move around the outside of one of the Haas drivers. I think it in a way goads Piastri into thinking ‚Äòthat‚Äôs where I can brake.\' But Hulkenberg runs wide himself, very wide actually,"" he continued. \n\n> ‚ÄúI think if the car in front of him, Hulkenberg, had been a bit easier on the brakes, naturally it would have made Oscar brake a bit earlier as well. But I‚Äôm giving him excuses. The calibre that he is as a driver, leading the world championship, as difficult as this is, you shouldn‚Äôt really be expecting mistakes like that when you are at his level. So a really disappointing weekend.‚Äù\n\nThat is an interesting potential factor, but as he said ultimately a terrible misjudgment from Osc.', ""I'm pretty sure it's because his car went into the wall instead of around the turn."", 'I think Ericsson hit him', ""I kinda feel like Baku could be good for Piastri in a way. He'll need to reset his mindset and self acknowledge that the mistakes he made were because of the pressure he put on himself.\n\nIt's a bit of a clich√©, but I do believe you learn more from your mistakes than your success.\n\nMcLaren talk highly of his analytical skills and his work ethic when it comes to focusing on his weak spots.\n\nRegardless, the next race is going to tell us so much about Piastri and whether he can perform under significant pressure, because the next race will have the biggest spotlight on him in his short career so far, even surpassing his debut imo."", ""It just looked he was distracted all the time. First the jump start which was not even milliseconds close but as close as a second. Then the crash it seemed as if he was again distracted & carried too much speed into the turn thinking he'll make some overtakes in the process. But went on the dirty side of the track & just locked his brakes.\n\nVery uncharacteristic of Piastri who's otherwise been so focused & calm. This entire weekend of Baku he just looked like a ghost of his former self."", 'Piastri braked 50+ meters later than others that were on the racing line. That is a recipe for disaster. He is a pro he should know where the limit is, no matter what a car in front of him does.\n\nI think he was just rattled by his poor start.

1no0vla,I think the 10 second penalty for Albon shows a deeper problem of the current stewarding,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1no0vla/i_think_the_10_second_penalty_for_albon_shows_a/,2025-09-22, Discussion,"I think this incident highlights the problems of the recent limit on penalties. Only handing out 5 or 10-second penalties for the vast majority of incidents means that incidents like this, which cost Colapinto 25+ seconds, kind of make it worth it (obviously not really, as it also costs Albon and penalty points). Introducing 15-second penalties, and actually using drive-throughs and stop-and-go's. 

The current stewarding process needs fixing in general. I think a selection of professional stewards is needed, but even stuff like this shows they need to go back over a lot of the guidance and really have another look.

They have pretty much sorted the extending track limits, which was a massive talking point a few years ago, by just using the B&W black, which is what it was there for, but wasn't used for ages. It shows that a lot of these stewarding problems do come from the guidance issued to them.","[""Penalties are not meant to repair the damage done, just to disuade drivers from doing certain things. I don't think it was worth it for Albon, even if it was way worse for Colapinto."", 'Bad take. Penalties aren‚Äôt there to vindicate the driver that got crashed into, but to punish the driver that caused the crash. Sucks to be the guy that got crashed into, but giving Albon a 25 second penalty because he cost Colabinto 25 seconds doesn‚Äôt do shit.', ""Stewarding has many more serious problems, I don't think this is a major problem.   \nConsistency and timeliness mostly.\n  \n\nIf you are found to gamble on penalties being worth it penalties do increase and have in the past (ie don't be dumb on radio). Penalties are also already handed out based on result often, so smaller penalties suffice.   \n  \nThe current drivers are also keeping it rather clean, so there is no need to penalize missteps as harshly"", 'Penalties should penalise the action and not the outcome. Which has been heavily discussed before with the Ham/Ver incident in Silverstone. \n\nPeople said a race ban would be appropriate, because Verstappen crashed with 50G and Hamilton was able to continue and score points.', 'I agree with you - Fornaroli on Dunne in the F2 race is another example.\n\nOn Russell at Monaco - it‚Äôs not good race direction IMO if the guidance allows drivers to profit from purposefully taking a penalty, which is entirely why the standard one moved up to ten seconds from five in the first place.', ""been saying it for a while. Driving standards have tanked a few years after the 5/10 second penalties. They were introduced to have less severe options for minor shit but they very very quickly became a replacement for almost all penalties. So many insane things done on track and rarely a drive through, stop go or black flag. Max shoulda got the black flag in mexico for sure. IN brazil again max should have gotten a drive through probably for how egregious that shove off was, but instead no penalty at all but that's because over hte years worse and worse behaviour went from a drive through, to a 10 second penalty, to a 5 second penalty to often being ignored.\n\nF2 is a heavy result of this. Kids coming through having never really watched/remembered f1 before the 5 second penalties were introduced. dive bombing being rewarded, cutting corners being rewarded is just the f1 they would have gone from like 5-15 yrs old watching and now those kids are in f3/f2 driving like maniacs."", ""Penalties aren't meant to copy the impact you had on the other driver. They are there to make it unattractive to do naughty stuff. \n\nThings would get very weird when you make a penalty the same as the impact on the other driver. It could even incentivize the other driver to crash his car in the wall because that can make sure that your rival will score 0 points we well. \n\nAnd what if a driver gets wounded or even dies in an incident. It would be a tragedy to lose 2 drivers ;)\n\nAlso it was very much not worth it for Albon here to begin with with a 10s penalty."", ""I know they are not meant to repair damage; it's more about how I can see this alongside other incidents labelled as 10-second penalties, which are not on the same level.\n\nIf you hand out 5-second penalties for minor incidents and 10-second penalties for everything besides that, then worse incidents are dealt with the same.\n\nIf drivers know that no matter what moves they do, the worst they will get is a 10-second penalty, things like Russell's chicane cutting at Monaco will become more and more common (I know he got a drive-through). \n\nMax got a 10-second penalty for the incident in Spain, which was a more serious incident than this by Albon, but I would also say this was a more major incident than quite a lot of the 10-second penalties handed out.\n\nAll of them exist on a scale, and not using the entire scale of penalties to reflect the seriousness of incidents seems like something that will come to cause a major problem eventually."", ""if he got a 25 second penalty he's not likely to do it again, and other drivers are unlikely to try to stick their nose in that late again. The fact that drivers so frequently get such small penalties encourages them to try these reckless moves dramatically more often.\n\nBut also there is this issue of fans looking at every dive bomb collectively and deciding they are all non risky. Albon had zero room there, zero chance, he was way too far back and this is not a track that has room for error, this was not a shallow corner with more than enough space for him to bomb in at that speed that late.\n\nthis was a literally never going to work move, not an well he messed up but the move was there for the taking, this move was never even close to on and he tried it anyway... because the penalty for trying is so low."", ""I wasn't saying he deserved a 25-second penalty; I'm more commenting on the fact that the scale of penalties the stewards are handing out does not show the difference in incidents across the calendar.""]",0,22,0.35,0,21,21,0,0,0.019999999999999962,0
