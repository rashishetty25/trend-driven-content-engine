1o8vy58,A warning about ticket prices and r/GrandPrixTravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o8vy58/a_warning_about_ticket_prices_and_rgrandprixtravel/,2025-10-17, Moderator Response,"Posting here because this is all about the mod of r/GrandPrixTravel and the kickbacks from a site called P1 Travel.  The sub is generally quite helpful but has a rule that any reselling of tickets at excessive prices will be removed.  And the mod, the single mod is always posting referral links (which he gets money for) to P1 Travel. The issue is the prices P1 Travel askes.  Lets take Suzuka which is on sale now:

B1 stand, officially 63,000yen turns into 132,000yen on P1... More than double. Then looking at the C stand + hotel package. It comes to 852.90 Euro going by the Japanese prices for everything you get, but the price is **€2,084** on P1 Travel**.**  More than a 2x price increase certainly seems excessive and into scalper territory for me. 

The biggest issue I have with this is sometimes I see people recommending to buy tickets from that site over official sales sites.  Pay double.. why? 

Before paying anything to any site, check official pricing first and ask yourself if you want to pay such a markup. And on seeing links anywhere on social media, check if they are paid links and then ask if the info you are getting is unbiased. ","['Thanks for bringing up this issue. We (r/formula1) used to redirect ticket and travel related questions to r/GrandPrixTravel. This was added after the mod of GrandPrixTravel suggested this in 2021 via ModMail\n\nIn February of 2025 we noticed that GrandPrixTravel has been **seemingly** monetized. They were stating that P1 Travel is a ""*community verified ticket vendor*"" of GrandPrixTravel and their subreddit was full of what appeared to be affiliate links for P1 Travel.^(The links were via the domain of an affiliate marketing platform and P1 Travel offers an affiliate program.) We found these links in the following places on /r/GrandPrixTravel:\n\n* In the sidebar\n* At the top of their wiki page for official circuit websites\n* At the top of their monthly buy/sell threads\n* In standalone mod-made posts\n* In AutoModerator comments triggered by certain keywords\n\nSome of these links were paired with messages pointing out that some other ticket websites are not fully reliable. In addition we also noticed heavy promotion of FanAmp, an app.\n\nWhen we became aware of all of this in February **we stopped the r/formula1 AutoModerator from redirecting users with ticket & travel related questions to r/GrandPrixTravel and removed links to that subreddit from our sidebar.**\n\nWhile GrandPrixTravel can be a useful resource we considered that it would not be appropriate to continue recommending it given these issues, especially since [Reddit\'s Moderator Code of Conduct](https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct) clearly prohibits *""moderation actions (including actions taken using mod tools, bots, and other services) in exchange for any form of compensation, consideration, gift, or favor from or on behalf of third parties""*', 'I made it to my personal mission to downvote that stupid mod every time I see it and the “hi here is X from P1travel” comments (this seemed to have stopped showing up)\n\nI will always recommend that people buy from the race tracks and only from the race tracks maybe F1 if they are desperate but the resellers are a no go imo…', ""The question is, why hasn't somebody reported the subreddit for violating [Moderator Code of Conduct](https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct), if this behavior has been occurring for awhile now.

It’s well known. \n\nLook at Suzuka now, everything except West Area is sold out.', 'The posts that I\'ve seen do always acknowledge that prices are higher than ""direct from circuit"". I guess it\'s a fine line, if there are no tickets left for ""general"" purchase, do you recommend a company that you are willing to put your name to, or let people amble off into the wild west of touts and scams.\n\nI do feel that if there\'s any recompense, or paid for promotion then it should be declared, but I think the ticket prices have always been made very clear in the posts, and the general line across the sub has always been ""go direct"" as a first port of call, so it\'s not a wholly uninformed choice if people use them as an alternative.', 'Can’t blame the guy for trying to make some money, but there may be a better way to go about it\xa0', 'Is there a guide to which areas of Suzuka are good for viewing?

Resellers are for people who don't want to or can't/haven't done that.\n\nFor some circuits, resellers may end up cheaper than dynamic pricing (looking at you Melbourne!) - I think we paid almost double face value from the circuit for Brabham tickets (my parents were coming over from the UK so we were prepared to pay that as we wanted to secure the tickets).""]",271,17,0.96,271,17,17,26,2,0.0,26

Lap record is 1:16.388 by an Austrian formula driver Josef Neuhauser who set the record in 2000 in a Minardi M190 Formula 1 car during the 2000 Rijeka interserie round.

What definitely needs to change for it to be fully viable are runoff areas and barriers, but since F1 already tried to invest into the track and wanted to use it for a Croatian GP I have no doubt that would be sorted if a deal was made.

Unfortunately, I think we'll never see a Croatian GP, but I want to see what you guys think about the track that is 10 minutes by car from my home.","['It looks like a very fun circuit to drive, but unfortunately I think it would offer few overtaking chances.', 'Not an emerging market for this “growth era”, best you can hope for is a minute chance of a Dubrovnik street circuit.\n\nNo, this answer has almost nothing to do with the track itself', ""not gonna lie, it looks leagues better than the new Street circuits that keep getting added to the calendar. How racing would be on it, i'm not sure, But im sure a lap around it would look and drive amazing. Especially the reverse Maggots Becketts and Chapel in turns 9 to 13."", 'Would it work for F1? Of course. \n\nWould it make for good racing? Almost assuredly no.\n\nThe track would be almost flat the entire time other than 3 corners', 'i mean , it doesnt look there really are any opportunities for overtakes here , most of the circuit can be taken flat out by an f1 car', ""I'm surprised it's not common knowledge that F1 races except monaco are always the amount of laps required to run 305km, in this case that would be 74"", 'Croatia? Give me Dragon Trail Seaside, I wanna see the drivers navigate the chicane of death.', 'Kinda looks like the baby of Monza and Cota', 'I’ll also add a minute chance for if there’s Croatian Verstappen/Lewis in the future', '[Here is an onboard](https://youtu.be/b2KB3Xmj2co) lap from an F3 driver that drove there.']",13,12,0.71,13,11,11,2,1,0.020000000000000018,2
1o8wcgy,[OC] How media perception differs from on-track reality for McLaren’s drivers for the 2025 season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o8wcgy/oc_how_media_perception_differs_from_ontrack/,2025-10-17, Discussion,"This visual compares the average media ratings (representing perceived driver performance) with the actual race results for McLaren’s drivers, Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, across the 2025 season so far.

Do you think McLaren’s perceived favoritism toward Norris is influencing how the media, and by extension the fans, rate him?","['The choice to show averages is weird. That just makes a few extreme results have effect on ""negative media perception"" for the whole year. You can see where the big drops were. So analyze those specifics weekends...', '> if media rating below race position = negative media reception\n\nNo, absolutely not. It just means other drivers mada fewer mistakes in worse cars', 'how do you even read this?', ""Lando's harsh rating at the start of the season was down to the fact he was driving poorly, he had a dominant car and was well below it.\n\nThe ratings are pretty fair and will be well below finishing positions as his car was still incredible.\n\nThat has set the tone for where his average media rating is sitting I'd suspect.\n\nBoth drivers media rating being lower than actual comes down to havig a dominant car, people always say it is more the car than the driver in that instance."", ""For me, it's more about how he's fumbling his chances in a dominant car after the way he talked about lewis and max in their dominant cars."", 'Unless Max wins it this season we will get the new weakest champion of 21st century\xa0', 'Lando’s dad irritates me…I might be allergic to him. When Hulk won and the crowd was happily cheering him on “Hulk, Hulk, Hulk”, Daddy got annoyed and starting chanting “Lando, Lando, Lando” in retort to them. Plus he’s one of England’s most wealthy men. \n\nMaybe some media people feel similar dislike to Lando’s family/privilege and unconsciously form a bias against him in their reporting', ""The graphs are all right. Your post isn't anti-Lando enough though, so you'll get downvoted to hell."", ""If the data don't show what you want them to, you fudge the stats like we always do.\xa0"", 'Yup, it appears to be a season-long running average over time, which seems silly to use in this case.']",0,38,0.38,0,34,34,0,0,-0.020000000000000018,0
