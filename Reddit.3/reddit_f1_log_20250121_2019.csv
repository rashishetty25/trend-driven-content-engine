1i6ns3t,What's the minimum healthy number of teams for a sustainable F1 grid,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i6ns3t/whats_the_minimum_healthy_number_of_teams_for_a/,2025-01-21, Discussion,"I've heard 12, I've heard 14, I've also heard that the league struggles to maintain 10 teams.  

I'm sure there are situations that can change the number so I'm basically asking, right now, how many teams you feel F1 should grow/shrink to for maximum health of the sport.

In my opinion F1 should look to target 12 active teams if possible.  I think that's a good number to allow 3-4 to struggle at any given time without majorly impacting the competitiveness of the entire grid and ensuring a competitive midpack, which as we saw in 2023 and  2024 can be vital for the longterm viability of the sport with McLaren and Aston Martin emerging from the midpack to challenge for top positions (and then Aston Martin falling back, but it was still fun while it lasted).

Bottom line in my mind 12 teams is the right number to maintain a healthy midpack from which new challengers for the stop spots might emerge.  This is entirely my own opinion but I'm curious what others think.","[""I think the maximum sustainable number is 13 since it's required for a circuit to be able to accommodate that, but a few probably wouldn't be able to support any more.

Not that it would die, but I think it would be bad. It's why I can't actually resent Lawrence Stroll, because without him we really might have gone down to nine teams, and the other teams still would have fought against an addition. \n\nI think ten teams is good.
