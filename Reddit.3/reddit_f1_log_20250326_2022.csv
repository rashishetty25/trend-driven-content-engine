This still got him P6.\n\n\nThat same gap to pole in 2025 would get you scraping in to P17.\n\n\nIn 2019 the slowest Quali time in China (set by Kubica in that godawful Williams) was over 3.7s off the pole time.\n\n\nLawson's P20 in China was only 1.533s off pole. Yes, the car is different, but you get the idea. 1.5s from P1 to P20 is incredibly low."", 'Gasly argued with Newey his car was wrong of course he was fired', ""He was consistently in the points and in hindsight he wasn't as bad, but the benchmark at that point was Ricciardo and the expectation was to match Verstappen.\n\nNow years later Max isn't just a feisty young driver with a few wins anymore but a veteran 4 time world champion, and after him, Albon, Perez and Lawson the expectation has changed, and Gasly would those performances today would be more acceptable I think."", ""2025 and there's not more than a second between all 10 teams (maybe 9 sorry Sauber)\n\nWhat was the average spread between teams in 2019? \n\nYup, he's failed in that seat, big time. But he's actually been setup to fail in my opinion. \n\nHe's had F-All chance to practice or test and the car looks like it's the hardest to drive yet. \n\nWill be interesting to see how Yuki goes in the RB and how Liam goes back in the VCARB"", 'Gasly got points but he was miles away from the front. The field was a lot more spread out and Gasly was nowhere near his team mate. In his 12 races he had 2 DNFs, finished a lap down 5 times, was almost a lap down 2 times. Performances like that in the 2025 field would be on a par with Lawson', ""People forget that in 2018 and 2019 (probably 2017, can't remember) there was a huge gap between Top 3 Teams (Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull) and rest of the field. It was pretty much impossible for a non Top 3 car to finish inside the Top 6 without a Top 3 car having a DNF or problem.\n\nLook at Austria 2019: Top 5 is within 22 seconds but P6 is already a lap down down, but gasly finished P7 in a Top car.\n\nLook at China 2019: Top 5 is within 31 seconds, then there is Gasly in P6 another minute down.\n\nTHIS is why Gasly got replaced, not the absolute number of points, you can't compare it. The field is much much much closer today.\n\nAnother stat: in 2019 before Gasly got replaced all other 5 people in the Top 3 cars combined had **3** finishes outside the Top 5. Hamilton had a 1+ minute pitstop in Germany, Vettel had a collision and penalty in Silverstone, and Bottas had a collision and damage in Hungary. Gasly alone finished 6(!) times outside the Top 6 in 12 races."", 'What is the point of this comparison when there is a six year and one major regulation change between the two cars.', 'Lawson had limited testing, limited practice at Australia and hadn’t driven the track before. He then went off in the wet on dry tires.\n\nHe hasn’t driven china either and had an hour’s practice before going straight into a qualifying session.

1jkh6kk,Did the Sauber Team make a tyre prep mistake in China?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jkh6kk/did_the_sauber_team_make_a_tyre_prep_mistake_in/,2025-03-26, Discussion,"Something interesting that happened that was relatively unnoticed in the chaos of lap 1 is both Saubers essentially ending their contention within the first half a lap of the race, with both drivers having a seemingly inexplicable loss of rear grip that put them off. Hulkenberg completely lost the rear on seemingly normal acceleration on the exit of T3/4, having to save multiple severe oversteer moments that put him into the gravel, damaging his floor and effectively ending his race. Later on in the lap, Bortoleto was in a battle with Bearman, and turned in relatively normally into T8 and instantly lost the rear in a basically unsavable moment that put him into the gravel, taking him out of race contention as well.

Both of these moments can be viewed here: [https://youtu.be/xY2yw7z\_2yk?si=SVezDkAevbN8oQeH&t=68](https://youtu.be/xY2yw7z_2yk?si=SVezDkAevbN8oQeH&t=68)

If one of these drivers had experienced this alone, it would be easy to put it down to driver error. However, the appearance of a similar issue on both cars in the first lap in seemingly innocuous moments when the drivers weren't even trying to make a move, leads me to believe that there was potentially some sort of issue on the car, or more specifically, the tyre preparation plan that the team had in place during the formation lap (ie number of burnouts, target tyre temp). It seems likely that the team made a miscalculation that resulted in the rear tyres being out of the window on both cars to start the race.

You set up your car less extreme than Max and you're slower a bit but then you want to compete with him, you push too hard and then you make mistakes and you lose confidence in the car and that's it for you\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ddEW\\_jHupA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ddEW_jHupA)"", 'We’ll find out soon enough- sink or swim time for TSU', ""I expect Tsunoda to struggle at least initially but I think he's Red Bull's best option at this point. \n\nIt'll be interesting to see just how far off Tsunoda is compared to Lawson on the Racing Bulls.  I still don't think the Racing Bulls car is faster (with Max behind the wheel) than the Red Bull but there is definitely a drivability difference."", ""I think the whole driving style conversation is a bit played out. For example (looking at your last sentence), in one of the interviews where Albon talked about the pointiness of the Red Bull car, he mentioned that he prefers more oversteer even when compared to drivers like Leclerc. Does this mean Charles would perform worse alongside Max than Alex did? I seriously doubt it. \n\nIt likely just comes down to the Red Bull being unpredictable due to design flaws. That makes it difficult to wrangle into some good pace. Max has reported the car oversteers and understeers basically from corner to corner. Max has enough ability to catch these changes and adjust on the fly, maintaining a decent pace. The better the driver, the more likely they'll be able to do the same.\n\nWhether Yuki will be able to is less to do with his preference and more to do with his actual raw ability.

The other way round, a driver maybe need a car to behave a certain way to get get his “mojo”. And if that’s not there, well, most of the times it’s just.. that’s a lost season or lost career.', ""If he's late and aggressive on the brakes I don't think he'll get on well with the car.

1jk395q,Could Leclerc go Down as One of the Best Drivers to Never Win a WDC?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jk395q/could_leclerc_go_down_as_one_of_the_best_drivers/,2025-03-26, Discussion,"Given the last decade or two have felt like f1's ""dominance era"" so many great drivers have started, ended, and driven most of their careers in a car that can barely win a race, let alone a championship.

Some big names with great primes that come to mind for me are Ricciardo and Massa. Granted, I haven't been watching as far back as their primes so I wouldn't know, but it truly feels like we have another uncrowned Champion in the making. 

Charles might have had mistakes earlier in his career but it really feels like he ironed them out last season and performs every race week. It's only early in his career but its possible we'll never see him lift the WDC Trophy despite being apparently more deserving than other names like Russel, Norris, or Piastri.

What are your thoughts? Could Charles go down as one of the best to never do it? Any other drivers this century that I'm missing?","['https://preview.redd.it/hwhj2dkwkyqe1.jpeg?width=739&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc15eda55bc8ff3cfab00efbbe424e8ebf77ef0b', ""Oh god I totally see it happening. Dude is going to lose it if Norris gets the WDC.\n\nAlso I'd argue Montoya is up there, he drove like a madman, but never got his well deserved WDC."", ""Why do people act like Norris, Leclerc, and Russell are going to retire soon and this season is their last chance to ever win? Even if they left their respective teams, they'd be snatched up in a heartbeat by another and likely continue to be competitive.

This sport has and had a ton of incredibly talented drivers that were just in the wrong place at the wrong time and couldn't acomplish it.\n\nAs an argentinian myself, I have to say Reutemann is another candidate... Didn't have the chance to see him race live myself (I was born a couple of years after he retired) but he was, bias aside, no doubt WDC material.\n\nOthers I could name are Gerard Berger, Jean Alesi, Eddie Irvine... David Coulthard was memed quite a lot but he was very good. Kubica had the talent and could've have a very realistic chance if not for the accident... Rubens Barrichello could've been another one if it wasn't for him having to live next to The Michael.\n\nI'd like to also say Martin Brundle who was incredibly fast but never even won a race... dude was always at the wrong place at the wrong time. \n\nAlso worth noting Alonso could've had a few more titles in his name if it wasn't, again, for being in the wrong place at the wrong time."", 'I still believe he’ll win it eventually, he’s only 27 and he’ll stick around as long as possible for a chance at a title. He’s not retiring early without at least one win. The real question is at what point would he decide to leave Ferrari for a better chance?\n\nBut if Ferrari never delivers and he never does win it, he’ll definitely be one of the best to miss out.

I've read comments that they have both been talking shit at one point or another?

I know they raced each other in the junior series but I wasn't really following that level too closely.","['They were actually good friends a while back. Red Bull puts their juniors up in the same block of flats in Milton Keynes, so you’d see them on stream together (same with Vips before his gamer moment). \n\nI think a lot of the shit talk is media saying half of a quote to them mixed in with the obvious conflict over both wanting that seat. \n\nTsunoda was asked whether he’s ready to take the seat. He said 100%. Reasonable question, reasonable answer. He was asked if he’d do better than Lawson in the RB21 in China, he said he didn’t drive in it in China so he doesn’t know but he didn’t feel he was too far off Max in his Abu Dhabi test.\n\nLawson was told ‘Yuki is saying he’s ready to take your seat’ and Lawson has hit back saying ‘Well actually I beat him in juniors and F1 so he can say what I want’. Lawson was probably a bit sensitive considering everyone was talking about him coming P20 twice and clearly struggling and the reporters have used the exact thing that would provoke him.\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see how they go.

It was in the end up to Red Bull how they’re going to do it.”\n\n“We’re still friends for sure, and we still chat each other, and I like to talk to him. And, yes, since 2020, before that, actually, we had a lot of time that we are teammates, driving in the same categories.”\n\n(via: GPblog)\n\nThey are used to competing with each other and have been rivals for many years. Lawson’s been more defensive in his recent comments about deserving the seat “he’s had his time, now it’s my time” and saying he beat Yuki in the junior series, he has no sympathy for Yuki getting passed over but I think that’s just due to the pressure and him trying to be all like i’m not here to feel bad for others/make friends i’m here to win etc.', ""Both competing for the same competitive seat and a little bit of history from their junior days.

After poor performances,  gets bombarded with questions: including what Yuki said and his response to that- he beat Yuki before. I would say the same, you need to be confident in yourself to drive an F1 car. \n\nThere’s no bad blood, just question and answers. The media is just blowing it up as usual.', 'They used to be teammates in the junior categories and I’m sure Redbull gmbh is stirring up drama for the media, because who doesn’t like a bit of drama?
