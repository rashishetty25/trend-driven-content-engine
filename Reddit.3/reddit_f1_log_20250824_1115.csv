He hasn't been in a formula car in years, hasn't seriously raced at any circuits on the formula calendar since COTA in 2019 and has no experience managing Pirelli tyres (tyre management being a notorious weakness of his).

1mys6cq,(OT) LIVE | Race | 4 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps 2025 (English),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mys6cq/ot_live_race_4_hours_of_spafrancorchamps_2025/,2025-08-24, Video,,"[""If you want some racing to watch this weekend, there's the 4 Hours of Spa, a European Le Mans Series race, on for free on YouTube, starting in just over 20 minutes.\n\nThere's three classes - LMGT3, which is road car based racing cars, LMP2, and LMP3. LMP2 may be the second tier of sportscar closed roof prototype racing car, but they're basically as fast if unrestricted by power and simple aero tweak regulations (adding diveplanes mostly) as the top tier WEC Hypercar as they are lighter than Hypercars and have better aero. This is due to the Hypercar regulations being slower than LMP1 which LMP2 was originally measured against. The universally used Oreca 07 is an excellent racing car, both for drivers and to spectate on broadcast.\n\nLMGT3 cars in the ELMS come from six different manufacturers. If you're a supporter of Ferrari you have a wealth of cars to choose from. It's basically the same as a GT3, with perhaps some tiny tweaks. The battles are excellent as different cars make performance on different parts of the circuit.\n\nAll LMGT3 cars are balanced against eachother with power restrictions and ballast weight added for fairness.\n\nLMP3 is the third class. It's a prototype that's a little faster than LMGT3. It's a smaller class and doesn't get much focus on broadcast.\n\nThe championship winning cars in both LMP2 subclasses and the winning car in LMGT3 are all automatically granted invites to compete at the 24 Hours of Le Mans the year following, so there are some real stakes in the championship battle. LMP3's winner also gets a LMP2 Pro/Am invite. Le Mans invites and a shot at a class win at the biggest 24 hour race are coveted amongst everybody competing.\n\nThere's one point in the LMP2 championship as we stand pre spa weekend. Four points in the LMP2 Pro/Am subclass. Six points in LMGT3, with the current championship leaders not having won yet. And the top 5 cars in LMGT3 are within nine points.\n\nSpa is an excellent circuit for sportscar racing. I think it suits sportscars and sportscar multiclass battling more than '22 and onward era modern F1 cars. You definitely won't be left feeling like you didn't see what Spa really can do for battles on track. No DRS or overtake system in ELMS - every inch and overtake is earned. There's no guarantee it will be an all time classic but the grid is stacked with talent and I'm sure we'll have a lot to get excited about.\n\nIf you are in the US you can watch on speedsport1 - https://speedsport1.com/how-to-get-ss1/""]",9,2,1.0,9,1,1,9,2,1.0,9
