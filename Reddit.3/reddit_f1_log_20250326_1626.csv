I have read that Tsunodas driving style is sharp and quick preferring a pointy front end and loose rear. he is also very late and aggressive on breaking. The main difference is being that he lacks the smoothness and a robotic precision that Verstappen has but he has good reflexes. 

From what Ive seen, it seems like Yuki’s driving style is a more ""staccato"" version of of Verstappen. With that being said is Yuki not more well placed to develop into a better teammate?

Does this mean Charles would perform worse alongside Max than Alex did? I seriously doubt it. \n\nIt likely just comes down to the Red Bull being unpredictable due to design flaws. That makes it difficult to wrangle into some good pace. Max has reported the car oversteers and understeers basically from corner to corner. Max has enough ability to catch these changes and adjust on the fly, maintaining a decent pace.

Vettel was the absolute KING of this with the blown diffuser. They are all very good off throttle mid corner stage, fast entry - get the car planted and pointed right then punch it out of the corner. The vaunted fast in, fast out style Schumi was known for. I think Max and Vettel had a lot of issues with the Renault engine and the way it behaved off throttle and fed power back in.
