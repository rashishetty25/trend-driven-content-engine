1obfu8y,Oscar Piastri remains confident despite slashed F1 title lead,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1obfu8y/oscar_piastri_remains_confident_despite_slashed/,2025-10-20, News,,"['>""I\'d still rather be where I am than the other two""', ""Definitely better to be leading the championship than not (obviously). He's still got a bit of a margin to Norris and Verstappen, should he have another race like COTA.\n\nIf you're Piastri though, you definitely want at least one more win to rebuild your gap. Ideally more than that, but one is a good place to start."", 'He needs to refind some form pretty quickly though. One good result and suddenly it looks a lot more healthy.', ""Fair enough, because for all the Max hype, a Pia, Ver, Nor finish in Mexico and it's basically curtains for Max and likely Norris too.\n\nThe momentum is heading one way, but it can swing around easy enough."", 'I think he got it this time , last year Mexico was just unlucky rather than a misstep , also he has kinda bettered his really bad tracks except cota where he barely had any runs , so yeah a week to digest . The mclarens are still fidgety but it’s possible to build a solid week .', '♫*jaws sounds*♫', 'Oscar desperately needs a win to regain some confidence, hasnt been the same driver since baku', ""He has more to worry about Lando than Ver as of right now. If he continues his poor form he'll have both."", ""Just got to dust himself off. FP1 and totalling it on lap 1 of sprint didn't help, full weekends will do him much better."", ""With only 5 races left, I think he's got good shot at driving it home.\n\nBut Max is going to make him earn it. My prediction is that at the end of the season it's going to be PIA, VER, NOR.\n\nPersonally, I'd love NOR to win it, though.""]",83,63,0.89,83,572,572,7,3,-0.010000000000000009,7
1obg6qw,'Dangerous' Tsunoda setting bad example to kids - Bearman,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1obg6qw/dangerous_tsunoda_setting_bad_example_to_kids/,2025-10-20, News,,"['lol think about the children Bearman', ""Listen, Tsunoda is underwhelming so far. But there was absolutely no room there for Ollie. You can't just dive bomb into a non-existent space and hope the other driver slams the brakes and gives up the corner. Tsunoda was full car length ahead, was under no obligation to give room."", 'I want to puke every time some of these drivers try to put weight on their claims with ""but the kids at home"" argument. \n\nYou fucked up, shit happens, own it up and move on. Fucking hell.', ""Driver with the most penalty points on the entire grid and who's one incident away from a race ban says driver with half as many penalty points is setting a bad example.\n\nOh the irony."", ""Why are people even blaming tsunoda? Just because bearman couldn't do the same move he got fucked with the day before?\n\nTsunoda is allowed to defend his position and if he thinks he might get dive-bombed in the next corner, he is allowed to preemptively take a tighter and/or non-optimal line to defend and prevent this potential divebomb."", ""> And when I finally did stick my nose in and attempt to move, he moved in reaction… didn't leave a car's width of track, and that's unfair, that's not allowed, and that caused me to avoid. \n\nDude was sending it from freaking downtown, by the time Yuki turned in there was no overlap at all. What is he talking about?"", 'Won’t someone think of the children and set a good example says Ollie, who has stuck up his middle to flip off other drivers during a race before.', 'That’s a stupid take. The fact that Bearman complained so much in the post match media is embarrassing. If it was some hot take inside the car then that’s fine.', ""Won't somebody think of the children.\n\nI hope this was just Ollie being heated from everything post race because it is kinda rich coming from the guy who's been wacked multiple times for safety infringements"", ""> He was fighting against Charles [Leclerc], who is not even in the race with him. Like, why are you defending [against] him?\n\nI bet Ollie also thinks Perez shouldn't have defended against Lewis in Abu Dhabi in 2021. Leclerc was a possible threat to Max, by making it hard for him to get by allowed his teammate to pull away a little further. Was it ultimately necessary? No. Did it hurt Red Bull to do it? Also no.""]",38,148,0.59,38,2425,2425,3,3,0.0,3
