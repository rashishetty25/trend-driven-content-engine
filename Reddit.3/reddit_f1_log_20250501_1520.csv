All changes in the document are in pink and you are encouraged to read it yourself.

* For races or sprint races which start behind the Safety Car the maximum total race time of 3 hours (1.5 hours for sprints) will commence once the green lights on the start gantry are illuminated to signal the safety car will leave the grid rather than the scheduled race start time.            
* The race director can under their sole discretion award an exception to the Restricted Period One for all Competitors should an official supplier fail to deliver their services promptly for the preparation of a competition in the period 12 hours prior to the start of Restricted Period One. This exception will not count as one of the 4 permitted exceptions.          
* There is now a greater clarification to the meaning of yellow flags which is in accordance with and supplementary to Appendix H of the ISC:            
   * Single Waved Yellow Flag: Any driver passing through a waved yellow flag marshalling sector must reduce their speed and be prepared to change direction. In order for the stewards to be satisfied that any such driver has complied with these requirements they are expected to have braked earlier and/or discernibly reduced speed in the relevant marshalling sector.             
   * Double Waved Yellow Flag: Any driver passing through a double waved yellow flag marshalling sector must reduce speed significantly and be prepared to change direction or stop. In order for the stewards to be satisfied that any such driver has complied with these requirements it must be clear that the driver has not attempted to set a meaningful lap time on the relevant lap. Furthermore, during a sprint qualifying or qualifying session, any driver passing through a double waved yellow flag marshalling sector will have that lap time deleted.        
   * Double Waved Yellow Flag during a Safety Car or Virtual Safety Car Period: Any driver passing through a double waved yellow flag marshalling sector during a safety car or virtual safety car period, in addition to the requirements of b), must stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU in each marshalling sector concerned.           
* There is now an exception for Monaco where they will an additional set of wet weather tyres during the competition (From 2 to 3 sets).         
* If a Heat Hazard has been declared and the driver has elected not to wear any of the personal cooling equipment, the 0.5kg of ballast in the cockpit may be fitted. This will only take place after the mass has been validated by the FIA Technical Delegate and under their supervision.       
* When cars which are required to start the race from the pit lane return to the pit lane having done the formation lap, they must proceed to pit exit at a constant speed and with constant throttle.         
* There is now a clarification that during the start procedure (For both standing and rolling starts) the pit exit will indeed be closed and competitors starting from pitlane may join the race one the last car has passed pit exit and the pit exit is opened.          
* Clarification that during Safety Cars, a green light on the SC will be used to indicate for either cars to overtake the SC to establish the order or for lapped cars to overtake.        
* Whilst lapped cars are proceeding around the circuit to join the queue behind the SC, at the sole discretion of the race director, the pit lane exit may be closed when the SC and queue are approaching and passing the pit lane exit.       
* When resuming a suspended race, the decision for a standing or rolling start will now be sent to all competitors after the two minutes point prior to the resumption.             
* In the case of a standing restart and at the sole discretion of the race director, the safety car may remain in pit lane and a message will be sent to all competitors “SAFETY CAR WILL REMAIN IN THE PIT LANE”. When the pit exit is opened all cars should leave the pit lane and proceed to the grid, the first car in line dictates the pace.","['The Financial Regulations were also updated with [the only change being on the last page with the inclusion of a row for ""New Entrant"" in the table detailing Capital Expenditure limits.](https://i.imgur.com/mR2OXXm.jpeg)', ""I still think it's crazy that there is such ambiguity surrounding yellow flags.\n\n>must reduce speed significantly and be prepared to change direction or stop\n\nDrivers are off the hook if they go from 350km/h to 340km/h, what meaningful difference does that make?

Its brakes overheated quickly, and it struggled to maintain speeds necessary for the F1 cars to keep their tyres and brakes at optimal temperatures.
