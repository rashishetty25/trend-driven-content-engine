For me, I think it will end up being Perez and Jak Crawford. I think they'll want a young driver and a vet. Bottas is probably the best vet available, but it will probably be Perez because he's from Mexico and can bring big sponsor money and a lot of Mexican fans.
And Jak because I think they'll want a young American driver and I don't think that Herta is as strong a connection as it was before.

I think it should be Bottas and Yuki. Yuki doesn't have a contract for next year and even though he's not so young anymore, he still has potential and hasn't gotten the shot he deserves. And Bottas is the best vet available.

And I personally would love for it to be Bottas and Mick Schumacher. This is meant to just be who you would love to see, I know this won't happen, I know that it shouldn't happen, but man I really want to see Mick drive anything other than a Haas. Him and Valterri are my favourite recent drivers.

On that basis, I would give a slight edge to the Red Bull.\n\nThe one thing people might say is an outlier about that year is that Vettel and Webber were quite closely matched, but to me that’s consistent with Vettel having a fair bit of improvement left in him. Webber was better in Monaco, Turkey, Germany, Hungary and Brazil. Webber also finished ahead in Spain, which is partially on Vettel for being unable to overtake Massa, but partially on the team for not strategising a way out of that situation. Vettel also took himself out hitting Kubica in Australia and got himself a drive through in Singapore. That to me is a much higher number of races (half the season pretty much) where Vettel didn’t maximise the potential of the car compared to a good number of years after 2010.', ""Making up for lost time wasn't easier because whatever the era of car people are trying to go as fast as they can anyway. \n\nThe current era of cars are particularly snappy, If the car goes it goes quickly.

However, when Norris had his Singapore-level pace… nobody could catch him—except himself, almost crashing into the wall.

Can Norris handle the pressure if the car is the fastest and he has bad luck or poor performances? Or maybe we'll see Norris 2.0 with no mistakes, crushing everybody. Or maybe Piastri will get as comfortable as he was in the lower categories, where he won almost every race…

Red bull's internal issues aside (power struggle, hornergate, newey departure) how much of the performance drop can be attributed to reduction of development time & money from finishing 1st for several consecutive seasons + cost cap breach penalty (-10% wind tunnel time) + late grasp of the current regulations by competitors?
