For me, I think it will end up being Perez and Jak Crawford. I think they'll want a young driver and a vet. Bottas is probably the best vet available, but it will probably be Perez because he's from Mexico and can bring big sponsor money and a lot of Mexican fans.
And Jak because I think they'll want a young American driver and I don't think that Herta is as strong a connection as it was before.

I think it should be Bottas and Yuki. Yuki doesn't have a contract for next year and even though he's not so young anymore, he still has potential and hasn't gotten the shot he deserves. And Bottas is the best vet available.

And I personally would love for it to be Bottas and Mick Schumacher. This is meant to just be who you would love to see, I know this won't happen, I know that it shouldn't happen, but man I really want to see Mick drive anything other than a Haas. Him and Valterri are my favourite recent drivers.

Brawn had the slightly stronger driver lineup, about enough to explain the 18.5 point win in the WCC.\n\nIf I had to pick one car, I think Red Bull were very, very slightly better over the course of the year, but you can make an equally good case for Brawn as well.', 'I‚Äôve been meaning to ask this same question for a while now! It is a really really difficult season to analyse because there were so many variables and I don‚Äôt have a lot of confidence in my answer, but here goes‚Ä¶\n\nI‚Äôd probably agree with u/GeologistNo3726, the two cars were very closely matched. I think in a straight fight the Brawn was probably quicker on average, but when the Brawn wasn‚Äôt quickest, it was more vulnerable to other cars taking points away from it, while the Red Bull didn‚Äôt face the same opposition while the Brawn was winning. On that basis, I would give a slight edge to the Red Bull.\n\nThe one thing people might say is an outlier about that year is that Vettel and Webber were quite closely matched, but to me that‚Äôs consistent with Vettel having a fair bit of improvement left in him. Webber was better in Monaco, Turkey, Germany, Hungary and Brazil. Webber also finished ahead in Spain, which is partially on Vettel for being unable to overtake Massa, but partially on the team for not strategising a way out of that situation. Vettel also took himself out hitting Kubica in Australia and got himself a drive through in Singapore. That to me is a much higher number of races (half the season pretty much) where Vettel didn‚Äôt maximise the potential of the car compared to a good number of years after 2010.', ""Making up for lost time wasn't easier because whatever the era of car people are trying to go as fast as they can anyway. \n\nThe current era of cars are particularly snappy, If the car goes it goes quickly. They are quite stable however, they aren't that hard to keep under control (relatively). Have a look at some mid 90s onboards and compare them to today. These cars look like they're on rails in comparison.""]",3,15,0.72,3,15,15,-1,5,-0.28,-1

Red bull's internal issues aside (power struggle, hornergate, newey departure) how much of the performance drop can be attributed to reduction of development time & money from finishing 1st for several consecutive seasons + cost cap breach penalty (-10% wind tunnel time) + late grasp of the current regulations by competitors?
