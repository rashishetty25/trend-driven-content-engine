Without developments, it risks finishing even behind Williams\n\n\n\nThe show of character at Imola helps “breathe,” brings morale (more to Hamilton than Leclerc) but cannot hide the serious troubles of a Ferrari, called this weekend to the Monte Carlo test, on the dreaded slow corners. Focusing on 2026, with rule changes and new superhybrid engines that few like, is crucial. But giving up the fight in the current championship could have devastating consequences on the standings and prestige. That is why developments are essential. Among the most important and long-awaited is the modified rear suspension. It has passed dynamic dyno testing and is being tested in the wind tunnel with different aerodynamics, it will change especially in the attachment area.

Williams, a team on the rebound, with Albon's fifth-place finish at Imola: 51 points collected, fifth among constructors behind the Cavallino, last year at the same stage of the championship was at zero.\n\n\n\nFerrari, on the other hand, took the reverse route: the average gap from the McLarens was 4-5 tenths, while at the end of 2024 it was around a tenth. The figure takes into account tire differences; this season Pirelli introduced softer compounds. Almost all the teams have met the performance increase forecast, not Ferrari.\n\nSome examples? If the 2024 Rossa had faced qualifying at Imola instead of the current one, it would have been half a second faster.  An enormity that cannot be explained only by errors in the preparation of the launch lap (Vasseur's thesis), by general difficulties in warming up the tires. \n\nThe compromise on heights\n\n\n\nIn Maranello, technical director Loic Serra is juggling two tasks: directing the 2026 group and correcting the SF-25's mechanical problems. It is not an easy job nor one that is quickly solved. Hamilton in recounting Sunday's comeback said the “car came to life.” What does that mean? That it starts going fast when the gasoline in the tank drops below 70 percent. The car's fundamental conundrum is a mechanical one: when the downforce (the force that crushes the car to the ground) shifts back, coming out of corners, the trim adjustments are not sufficient to cover its limits. Compression damages the bottom if the height is too extreme in qualifying, and so one must accept compromise solutions that lose 15-20 load points on Saturday.\n\n\n\nThe 2024 wing for Monte Carlo\n\n\n\n The fix is forced, the revised suspension is expected by the British GP at Silverstone (July 6). But first the most decisive Saturday of the season must be faced, in Monte Carlo where something winning will be seen again: in fact, the rear wing of the SF-24 with which Leclerc took pole and then triumphed in the race twelve months ago will be used. It will also be Adrian Newey's first time in an Aston Martin uniform. They tell us in Maranello that someone regretted not taking him. Market research is wide open-the problem is convincing the brains to come."", 'Ferrari had great pace in last race but..... what I can see in race that the car still feels sluggish at tight corners, the rear end is way too slippery and it hasn\'t improved much since Aus.

So I’m cautious optimistic about his chances to fight for the title.', 'Putting it simple: having a better feel for balance, rear end behavior, and brake response probably gives Max the confidence to make the lap 1 move (admittedly, wouldnt put trying regardless past him at all 😉)\n\nThat aside - on this track Redbull and McLaren were pretty much on par - best evidence is the almost non-existent delta between NOR and VER after NOR clearing PIA after the safety car - similar tire age, similar fuel load, similar degree of clean air', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **All signs pointed to victory for McLaren. In the end, Max Verstappen still emerged victorious. Did Red Bull manage to turn things around and bring the wonder car to its knees with its onboard resources?**\n\n> The favorites couldn\'t be clearer. Oscar Piastri on pole position, McLaren fastest in the discipline where Red Bull and Mercedes are most feared. Hot weather and track temperatures of 45 degrees Celsius on Sunday, plus the softest tire compounds Pirelli can offer, all signs pointed to a McLaren victory.\n\n> And yet, in the end, Max Verstappen won. Just like in Suzuka. Although the track and conditions aren\'t comparable, Formula 1\'s farewell performance at Imola told a similar story. Verstappen won the start. This is even more crucial for Red Bull than for McLaren. With a clear track and a clean airflow, the RB21 almost has McLaren qualities.\n\n> Then, with the better-placed car, McLaren gambled with the strategy, just like in Japan. Piastri was brought in for a tire change on lap 13. This committed them to a two-stop race early on. McLaren underestimated two things. The hard tire wasn\'t as good as expected. And Piastri was stuck in traffic longer than expected. Although the Australian had to overtake seven cars in 15 laps, he only lost just under a second to Verstappen. This shows: The speed was there.\n\n> **McLaren loses race at the start.**\nLando Norris was already ten seconds behind after ten laps in the slipstream of George Russell\'s Mercedes when he finally managed to establish his pace. 18 laps later, it was 8.7 seconds. After Verstappen\'s VSC gift, the lead grew to 20 seconds. Norris reduced it to 18.4 seconds before the safety car 18 laps later.\n\n> The neutralization gave Verstappen and Norris a chance for a second tire change, narrowing the gap to zero, but McLaren was unlucky enough to have Piastri on old tires between them. By the time Norris had fought his way past his teammate, the train had finally left the station.\n\n> The bottom line is that McLaren was perhaps a touch faster, but never fast enough. ""The race might have had a different outcome had Oscar won the start,"" admitted team principal Andrea Stella. From then on, McLaren was on the defensive and had the choice to react or take a risk. They chose the risk and lost.\n\n> **That\'s why the heat was good for Red Bull.**\nBut why couldn\'t the McLarens take advantage of the conditions and the tire types available, as was the case in Miami? The track temperature was only 39 degrees Celsius. Yet, winner Piastri beat Red Bull and Mercedes by more than 37 seconds.\n\n> For Stella, the result at Imola was no surprise. ""Suzuka and Jeddah, like Imola, showed that this type of track suits Red Bull and limits our advantage. All tracks feature fast, flowing corners. Imola requires a completely different aerodynamic configuration than Miami. Furthermore, Red Bull made a good step with their upgrades. Nevertheless, we were surprised at the end by how fast and consistent they were.""\n\n> Red Bull technical director Pierre Waché had an explanation for why the heat didn\'t play into McLaren\'s hands on Sunday. ""On certain types of asphalt with certain tire compounds, the tire wear mechanism changes in our favor in hot weather."" The Frenchman declined to elaborate on the tire 101. ""That would give too much away.""\n\n> **Better balance enlarges setup window.**\nRed Bull has improved its much-maligned RB21 with its two-piece upgrade. The new underbody, which was already installed in Miami, delivers more stable downforce. The modified cooling intake optimizes the airflow around the sidepods, the modified rear wishbone fairings to the diffuser, and the new rear brake vents allow for better control of tire temperatures. ""But it will take time until this works as well as it does at McLaren,"" fears Sporting Director Helmut Marko.\n\n> The impact of recent developments was felt by the drivers. The Red Bull no longer changed its balance between turn-in and the apex. The understeer mid-corner disappeared, but the oversteer on the exit remained. But Verstappen can live with that. ""For the first time in a long time, Max hasn\'t complained,"" Marko said with a sigh of relief.\n\n> The champion praised: ""The car was easier to control. This made it easier to manage the tires."" Team principal Christian Horner explained that the improvements to the car expanded the setup window. Friday and Saturday were like night and day. This time, it was possible to find a good car setup and not just a half-baked compromise.\n\n> The decisive factor will be whether Imola, like Suzuka, was just a snapshot in time where the car benefited from favorable conditions or whether it will provide a better platform in the long term. Technical director Waché remains tight-lipped: ""Am I confident now? I don\'t have an answer to that. I was after Suzuka, and then we were beaten by McLaren three times in a row.""', 'i seriously hope this was a real improvement for red bull, it would make the title fight an absolute banger if it was these 3 going at it every race', ""It's not 'or', it's 'and'."", 'I think the simple answer to this question is, track dependent performance. And if RBR have been able to widen the operating window, there will be more tracks where they are able to compete with McLaren. Max is other worldly but he didn’t just make up for a 35 second deficit across a race by himself', ""Passes were surprisingly easy due to the higher than expected tire deg. Verstappen's pace was real. I think it's a 50/50 mix of an improved car and Verstappen magic.\xa0"", 'Even Yuki said the car felt better... Before he wrecked in q1', 'Horner did say that they made good improvements to the car over the weekend in his post race interview, but also praised effusively the move that Max put on Oscar in T1, so my guess is that they got the car reasonably closer and then the rest was Max being Max.']",138,158,0.84,138,1504,1504,-3,1,0.0,-3

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

1kqqrmy,A call for respect on behalf of Argentine Formula 1 fans,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kqqrmy/a_call_for_respect_on_behalf_of_argentine_formula/,2025-05-19, Discussion,"I deeply regret the inappropriate comments and insults uttered by a small group of people who, perhaps newly familiar with Formula 1, have unfairly attacked drivers and their associates who had some kind of incident or interaction on the track with Franco Colapinto.



I want to make it clear that this attitude in no way represents the feelings of the vast majority of Argentine motorsports fans, and Formula 1 fans in particular. The true followers of this exciting sport greatly enjoy every broadcast, value the talent of all the drivers, and enthusiastically support the career of our representative, Franco Colapinto, without ever resorting to disrespect or verbal abuse.



We sincerely apologize to anyone who may have felt offended by these regrettable actions, which tarnish the sporting spirit and genuine passion we feel for the highest category of motorsports.","['I don\'t think it\'s just a ""small group"" given how we have seen similar grotesque behaviour in other motorsports like Indycar and other sports like football.', 'Does Argentina have a disproportionate amount of teenage boys? Or adults with the same level of maturity?', ""I think the problem is the very big difference between traditional motorsport fans and football fans. There's a group so big on instagram formed by dumbass football fans that watched their very first F1 race last year, honestly anyone who watched F1 before 2024 in Argentina is dying of embarrassment right now. I'd like to bury my head in the ground and hope these attacks never happen again."", ""Having seen what happened to Callum Illot, I feel like it's not a small group.  I even had people tell me in the wake of the Illot situation that I shouldn't be so sensitive and that was just how people act in Argentine sporting communities."", 'I think this is a nice post, but the issue is a BIG problem, the pure numbers mean nothing, and the only way to fix it is for other Argentine fans to aggressively call bad fans out and ostracise them from the discussion. \n\nIn cricket we have a similar problem with fans from  a certain subcontinental country - and their ‘support’ just ruins it for everyone involved.', 'In summary, social media and echo chambers have made it easy for a “vocal minority” on instagram to hurl racist abuse at competitors in “support” for “their” driver. \n\nThis is sadly nothing new - see the extremist arms of popular drivers’ fan bases who shout vile things at one another online. The internet has made this acceptable. \n\nThis isn’t just an Argentinian fan problem. See also the racist abuse hurled at black British football players after the Euros.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is half the shit people say online they wouldn’t have the balls to say in person.', 'Nah fam, I agree it’s not all argentinians, but it’s not a small group either. This is not the first time of the first sport where this happens.', ""The same thing happened with Augustin Canapino and Callum Ilott in Indy car tho. And other drivers in Indy that Argentine fans didn't like for whatever reason."", ""This isn't new or a particularly small group. It's cool you aren't like them, and it's probably not an actual majority who are crazy.. but it's not some group of 100 fans or something.
