1j14ga0,Insights behind the “Steer Sweep” technique,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j14ga0/insights_behind_the_steer_sweep_technique/,2025-03-01, Featured,"So earlier today u/Shezoplay1 noted that Lando was doing a “steering sweep” during his running at the test this week.

I was part of the team at RBR that (AFAIK) invented this technique. I have been out of F1 for a few years now and it is clearly no longer proprietary info, so I thought I would share some insights behind the technique and what it’s trying to achieve.

First off, let’s start with a primer, for context.

**What is aero mapping?**

An aero map, simply put, is a multi-dimensional model that attempts to model the aerodynamic response of the car (typically in terms of SCL and aero balance) against a set of variables. Each of these variables adds a dimension to said model.

SCL is our basic currency of downforce, measured in non-dimensional terms. It is a variant of CL (i.e. lift coefficient) but with no “Area” in the equation. For the mathematically inclined, SCL = Lift / (0.5 x air density x velocity ^2 )

SCL is made up of SCLf (front axle) and SCLr (rear axle). Aero balance is simply SCLf/SCL, ie the percentage of total load that is going through the front axle.

The dimensions that go into a typical model consist of things like: ride height (FRH and RRH), yaw, steer, roll. These were the well known variables, but at the same time aerodynamicists knew that these did not fully “explain” the variation of aerodynamics from one car state to another, because models trained purely on these variables did not provide great correlation. In the late 2000s, other new variables like **curvature** were starting to gain consideration in the correlation question. We’ll leave some of the others for another day.

**So what is curvature?**

Simply put, curvature is the reciprocal of corner radius, i.e. 1/r. Sharp low speed corners have high curvature, 130R has low curvature. Corners with curvature impart a curved flowfield on a car (crosswind yaw at the front, conventional yaw at the rear) and this is unqiuely different from the effects of pure yaw (all wind is coming from the same direction) and steer.

The issue with curvature is that it is very difficult to recreate in the wind tunnel (also another story for another day) due to the straight tunnel walls by definition imparting 0 curvature on the flow, and so you can only really model it in CFD. This is one of the many reasons why wind tunnel outputs have different flow physics from CFD ones, btw. However, the wind tunnel is *by far* the better of the two environments for building an aero map from, because you can have hundreds of test points to create your aero map from, for a given spec of car.

So, the result of this is that your aero map is compromised, it knows nothing about curvature. This is not great, because your aero map is your core manual for understanding your car. You feed this map into all your sims, your ride height optimisation models, etc. it is the single most important numerical output of the aero department.

**Introducing the track mapping experiment**

This is when RBR introduced the track mapping exercise. Why not build an aero map using the real car? You can measure pressures continuously on the aero sensors, so all that is needed is a track “trajectory” that covers the full range of values that each of your aero map dimensions typically cover. That should, in principle, give you enough “coverage” in your map to build a model from.

**So where does the steer sweep come in?**

Steer angle is something the wind tunnel shows very high SCL sensitivity to. The wind tunnel model allows you to independently sweep the steer angle while holding all other variables constant.

This is much harder to do on track. However, we do see a very wide range of steer angles on a track trajectory. The important thing to note is that on track, this range of steer angles is highly coupled with curvature and somewhat highly coupled with ride height. So you only get very high steer on track in conjunction with high FRH and high curvature.

This is what the sweep solves: we can now log a full range of steer angles *while holding FRH and curvature roughly constant* - this allows our model to better differentiate the aero effects created by the steer effect, from those created by curvature, ride height, etc.

The technique itself involves the driver overslipping the tyre, by sharply sawing at the wheel (usually 3-4 “spikes” in the steer trace per low speed corner). The sharp and transient nature of the sweep means the front end doesn’t grip up and the actual trajectory (and therefore curvature) around the corner is almost unaffected.

This post would be way better with some graphics, so I apologise for not providing these!

EDIT: 

**FAQs from the comments**

**Isn't this what Fernando has been doing for years?**

We are talking about two very different things, albeit both involving aggressive steering.

As far as I understand, ALO uses an aggressive initial steer angle (once) on corner entry, generating high slip angles and inducing higher mechanical grip in cornering. I don't know much about tyres (black magic to me) but that's the basic principle.

What the aero mapping technique described here is doing is creating 3-4 instances of very high steer within the space of one corner to measure the aerodynamic effect of steer angle on floor aerodynamics. The instances of high steer are too short and sharp to generate a mechanical grip response.

**Why care about de-coupling steer and curvature in the map, when these are practically coupled in reality?**

A few reasons:

(1) The aero philosophy at RBR was historically to develop benign aero characteristics, in excess of what the car is likely to see on track. This ensures a stable and consistent aero platform across the most extreme conditions - this is basically what allowed RBR to develop *the* high rake car - the yaw/steer/roll response at the combination of extreme ride heights (low front, high rear) was relatively benign and the team kept pushing this limit as far as it could go. To do this effectively you want to de-couple all your aeromap variables to understand *which* physical effects are causing non-linear aero behaviours, at the aero map extrema, so you can replicate them in CFD/tunnel and then design your way out of them. With the steer effect isolated from the curvature, you can also have greater faith in your SCL vs Steer graph that is coming from the wind tunnel, where most of the design iteration is happening.

(2) Curvature and steer are coupled, but not by a fixed ratio. The steer vs curvature graph when plotted from on-track data, across different tracks, tyres, track temperatures, etc is not a straight line but somewhat cone shaped. So, if you want your aero map to recreate that cone, you need your training data to have some decoupling within it.","[""Hey!

Believe me: preseason testing means jack shit.

Every year, we get bombarded with lap times, fuel loads, tire degradation charts, and endless analysis of ""long runs."" Teams sandbag, others chase headlines, and somehow, people convince themselves they’ve cracked the code.

But guess what? It never predicts the real pecking order. Never has, never will.

- 1994: Williams looked untouchable. Then Senna struggled, and Benetton happened.
- 1998: Williams still looked solid. Then McLaren turned up in Melbourne and lapped the field.
- 2001: Ferrari and McLaren seemed close. Then Schumacher casually won the first four races.
- 2009: Brawn GP barely existed in testing. Then they rocked up and dominated.
- 2014: Everyone knew Mercedes was quick, but not that quick.
- 2019: Ferrari looked like world-beaters in testing. Then Australia happened.
- 2023: Red Bull was “solid,” but not miles ahead. Then Max happened.

Judging from the size of the damper and other elements, this bulge doesn't seem to be necessary. 

My guess is that if there is no bulge, the anti-roll bar of the car will rotate when the car turns, causing its rocker arm to contact the suspension cover. 

It seems that Mercedes started to replace a larger anti-roll bar rocker arm at the Austrian Grand Prix last year? How does this upgrade work? It seems that Mercedes kept the bulge design because it don't want to increase the height of the suspension elements?
