1gru00i,[Tobi Gr√ºner] Formula 1 is working on a rule change for 2026 to make life harder for customer teams like RB or Haas.

We had to work a lot on the regulations. Especially with regard to energy management, to ensure that the cars also behave like real racing cars and have no undesirable characteristics. ""We are very happy. I think we have done well,"" Tombazis reports.
