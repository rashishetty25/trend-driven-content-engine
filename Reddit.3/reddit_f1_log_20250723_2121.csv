This is an unapologetically long post for anyone curious about what it actually entails‚Äîcost, experience, driving impressions, and more. There‚Äôs a video link down below, and I‚Äôll do my best to answer any questions you‚Äôve got!

Big thanks to my incredible wife and family for making this dream a reality for my 40th birthday. ü•π

**TL;DR:**

Yes, it‚Äôs every bit as awesome as you imagine‚Äîand totally worth it.

# Cost:

Let‚Äôs get this part out of the way: it‚Äôs not cheap.

* Formula Renault: 2x 15-minute sessions
* F1 Car: 1 out lap + 3 flying laps
* Price: \~‚Ç¨2800 total
* Insurance: ‚Ç¨8000 excess if you crash the F1 car
   * Optional insurance available for ‚Ç¨350 to reduce excess to ‚Ç¨4000
   * I skipped it. My strategy was simple: don‚Äôt crash.

# Briefing & Organisation:

As a non-French speaker, I was a bit nervous about language barriers‚Äîbut the staff were amazing. They went out of their way to make sure I was fully included, even doing dual-language briefings just for me.

They also gave me a personal track guide with an instructor, while the French attendees were grouped 8 to a minibus. I got to ask loads of questions!

The briefings were solid, with useful instruction on things like weight transfer and the grip circle‚Äîa helpful way of visualizing how lateral loads impact traction.

# The Track ‚Äì Magny-Cours:

One of the main reasons I picked this experience was the track. Not many F1 driving experiences let you drive on a real Grand Prix circuit‚Äîbut Magny-Cours absolutely is one.

* Long straights where you can go flat out
* Proper heavy braking zones
* Wide range of corners
* Cones marked braking, turn-in, apex, and exit points
* No restrictions on pace‚Äîcoaching was designed to help you go faster, not just stay safe

After this, Magny-Cours is now one of my favorite tracks.

# The Cars:

**Formula Renault**

These are not slow.  
Acceleration was wild, but the car was approachable enough to build confidence. Still had more than enough power to bite‚Äîmultiple people spun during the morning.

By the end of my sessions, I felt like I was really starting to explore the car‚Äôs limits.

**F1 Car ‚Äì Benetton B198**

* 1998 Benetton B198 chassis
* Original V10 replaced with a 3.5L Cosworth HB V8 (same spec Schumacher used to win the 1994 title)
* Still over 600hp
* No joke.

# The Driving Experience:

Their starter was broken, so I got a push start‚Äîold school!

* Launch: 2nd gear, clutch in, exactly 5% throttle (displayed on the wheel), then clutch drop on command‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôre driving a freaking F1 car.
* Gearbox: Paddle shifts are violent‚Äîinstant upshifts, jarring downshifts. Get it done in a straight line if you can.
* Braking: After being told to ‚Äústop braking like a grandma‚Äù in the Renault, I overcooked it and locked up on my first fast lap (big smokey lock up...). Backed it off slightly after that. Still, incredible stopping power.
* Steering: Heavy. After 4 laps, my arms were toast. These big tyres don‚Äôt turn themselves.
* Power: It‚Äôs not the original V10, but it‚Äôs still ferocious. I applied the same throttle I had in the Renault‚Ä¶ then found another couple of centimetres of pedal travel and entered warp speed. You‚Äôll hear in the video when I hit the ‚Äúparty zone‚Äù of the throttle‚Äîit just goes.
* Cornering felt solid, but I was cautious with throttle application‚Äî‚Ç¨8000 reasons not to spin...

# Post-Lap Emotions:

When I got out, I was literally shaking from adrenaline. Genuinely got emotional‚Äîtears and all. It was one of those rare life moments where the dream actually lives up to the hype.

# The Video:

I wasn‚Äôt going for lap records‚ÄîI pushed as much as my wallet would let me. Please be kind, but critique away:

That makes the deficit about 100BHP tops. \n\nI can only assume the 180BHP figure comes from a later year like 1983, when the turbos had progressed substantially, while normally-aspirated engines had only made a slight jump forward with the likes of the DFY."", 'They had this car at this years Goodwood FOS!
