1o6dyma,McLaren CEO Zak Brown rejects Alex Palou’s Oscar Piastri claim as ‘ludicrous’,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o6dyma/mclaren_ceo_zak_brown_rejects_alex_palous_oscar/,2025-10-14, News,,"[""Isn't this what Palou wants to prove though?

That was twisted into a gazillion headlines and videos that basically said, ""Zak Brown Did Not Want Oscar Piastri."" This is Zak\'s response:\n\n>“I’m not sure which allegation amused me more – the notion that I would not be the one making a key decision about our driver line-up, or the suggestion that I wasn’t on board with signing the hugely talented Oscar Piastri,” said Brown.\n\n>“Both allegations are clearly ludicrous – and anyone who follows our sport will see straight through them.”\n\nI don\'t doubt that Zak tried to blame Seidl or distance himself from signing Oscar to assuage Palou after he had signed the contract. But to say Zak didn\'t want Oscar is untrue.', 'Palou should sign with Alpine and make a video.', ""I don't see any CEO not wanting Piastri. As a back to back F3 and F2 winner, that puts him in a 'safe bet' driver tier.\n\nPalou could be even better for what we know, but Piastri is still a good bet nonetheless."", 'Did Alex Palou ever think about joining Red Bull as a TP? We need the shit stirring now that Horny is gone.', 'Like I am a little lost in this situation. From what I understand, Zak probably did wanna keep his word with Palou at first, but it would have been really dumb to not sign a rookie with so much promise like Oscar. Like even if Oscar hadn’t amounted to much in his first few years, he had an impressive career in the junior leagues. I only started watching F1 recently but it was a little crazy to me learning that the bidding war for Oscar was only between alpine and McLaren, I would have thought that more teams would have wanted someone with as much promise as Oscar (but we kind of see it today with how bortoleto is stuck in a sauber I guess)', '>“Zak told me that Oscar’s performance would be evaluated against mine for the 2024 seat,” added the Spaniard.\n\nI am no legal expert, but that seems to undermine his entire argument. This makes it sound like there was some kind of selection criteria that McLaren were using to evaluate Palou and Piastri, so Palou would have to demonstrate that he out-performed Piastri and Piastri still got the seat. On top of that, [some of his comments](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/palou-mclaren-f1-deal-brown/10766553/) made it clear that there was no guarantee of a seat:\n\n>“When testing with McLaren, Zak told me he believed we could make it happen, and that he would give me all the preparation I needed to get to F1,” he said in court, as reported by\xa0*Motor Sport Magazine*. “At the time I thought he was genuine.”\n\nSo Brown believed at the time of the test that getting into Formula 1 was a possibility. He is very clearly not making a guarantee, and surely Palou had to know that other drivers would be in contention for the seat.', 'Oh boy this could get spicy', ""You don't disprove allegations of being a liar by showing how your lies were obviously lies.""]",1002,135,0.96,1002,3827,3827,12,1,0.0,12

His legal team says that the Spaniard should not have to pay the team for the testing sessions because they benefitted McLaren.\n> \n> “This expenditure was not ‘wasted’,” say documents submitted by the defence. “McLaren got precisely what it expected to: an F1 reserve driver from October 2022 to August 2023, and an opportunity to assess his potential in an F1 car […] any such claim is reduced by reason of the $3.5m which McLaren Racing has or will receive for granting Mr Ryo Hirakawa the opportunity to take Mr Palou’s place in its ‘Testing Previous Car’ programme and participate in an FP1 test session at the Abu Dhabi GP in 2024.\n\n\nPalou's defense is pretty reasonable to me.
