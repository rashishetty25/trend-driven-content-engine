While he will start the championship with rookie Jack Doohan as a team-mate, he will discover another collaboration, but looks forward very positively to 2023 and 2024.\n\nDespite some tense moments, right up to the controversial collision at the Monaco Grand Prix last May, the French driver considers that Alpine was lucky to have this duo, particularly in the way it salvaged an unexpected sixth place in the constructors' championship last year.\n\n“It's true that we haven't really had the opportunity to say goodbye,” confided Pierre Gasly on Tuesday in London, when Esteban Ocon had left Alpine for Haas prematurely, not taking part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. “I think it was, when you think about it, the kind of story that we'll find hallucinating in twenty or thirty years' time. When we were told it was impossible to make it in F1, we both made it, in the same French team. It's a very beautiful story, with the podium in Brazil that will remain memorable.”\n\n**Fortunately, there were two drivers like us, both talented and motivated.**\n\nPierre Gasly also believes that the 100% French duo, while explosive on paper, proved the most skeptical of the pairing wrong.\n\n“We've proved that we're professionals,” he insists. “Everyone told us it would be a mess with both of us on the team. But it's a good thing there were two drivers like us, talented and motivated, because in-house competition allows us to give it our all. We never gave up, and if we managed to turn around what was a very complicated season last year, it's also partly thanks to the work we did together. We can be happy about that.”\n\nFrom now on, Pierre Gasly will cross paths with his compatriot on the track, but in the colors of Haas, which doesn't necessarily change his state of mind.\n\n“The rivalry has always been there,” he admits. “I've got 19 rivals on the grid, whether it's Esteban, Charles \\[Leclerc\\], Lewis \\[Hamilton\\]... After that, there are animosities between everyone and it's up to us to manage that. I'm a professional, I fight hard on the track but with respect, no matter who I'm up against.”"", 'The final straw for me with DTS was them trying to spin it into being a disaster. \n\nAlpine might be a mess, both those guys did just fine together.', 'I remember joking that it was going to be ""dinamite"". I\'m happy they had Brazil as a goodbye as team mates, they both looked really happy.', ""Let's be real here.  The problem at Alpine isn't Ocon and Gasly.  It's fucking Alpine.   I think they made the best out of a very bad situation.  Yes, they had a couple of dust ups  (all the teams do, now and again, don't they?), but they were \\*not\\* the problem."", 'Gasly’s F1 career could be a blockbuster movie trilogy at some point\n\nPart 1: Having arrived to the sport as a hot up-and-coming talent, he gets a shot at the front of the field next to one of the most talented drivers to ever exist. The pressure mounts, he flounders in comparison to his teammate, and winds up getting demoted back into the midfield. Around the same time, one of his best friends tragically loses his life. Determined as ever, Gasly puts up some of the best midfield performances ever, climaxing at his Monza 2020 win and continuing through 2021.\n\nPart 2: Gasly decides that after seeing AlphaTauri’s struggles in 2022, it’s time for a change of scenery. He winds up getting pitted against a childhood rival whom the media attempts to paint as his enemy. Their first year together is marred with collisions in Australia and Hungary, and the start of their second year sees them floundering at the tail end of the field. However, they have some stellar performances at the season end, highlighted by the double podium in Brazil, and wind up way higher up the WCC order than they anticipated at the start of the year.\n\nPart 3: ???', ""Between Gasly and Ocon it really wasn't. Melbourne 2023 was a freak accident for which there didn't appear to be any real animosity between them, and Monaco 2024 was silly by Ocon but the team reaction was extremely irrational and made it Wade worse than it had to be...\n\nI think in some ways it was probably easier for them to work together in a professional manner given they weren't trying to preserve any personal friendship while also competing directly against one another.\n\nBrazil 2024 was a really nice send-off for their partnership honestly."", ""It might have been a mess. If the car wasn't so bad."", 'Ocon has the win at all cost attitude of a champion.

1ispq3g,What were your favorite livery reveal productions (not the livery itself)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ispq3g/what_were_your_favorite_livery_reveal_productions/,2025-02-18, Discussion,"I know many hated on the production but I thought it was pretty good especially for first year production. I was keen to see how each team would use the stage. 

I really enjoyed the variety of ways each team chose to do their reveal from James Bond references (Alonso zip lining in from that clip was a missed opportunity) to Red Bull making a nod to... Initial D! 

But live production-wise, I thought the Kick one was really well done and I loved the Haas effect of the wall breaking apart as the car came through.","[""I really liked the Williams reveal actually. Partially I guess because it's second you realise all the teams really went different directions for their reveals but I loved the video they had and the car slowly falling from the sky was cool. Also liked McLaren's row of championship winning cars (even if including the 2008 car is a bit of a cop-out)"", ""Podium finishers for me are: \n\n1. Ferrari had far and away the best pre-reveal production imo since they actually utilized the screens in a way that felt like F1\n\n1. McLaren having their championship cars on the stage was really cool as well\n\n1. Red Bull's general car culture approach was a nice switch-up\n\n\nIt's a shame they were all the most underwhelming liveries lol"", ""Aston Martin's James Bond sequence was pretty cool.\n\nShoutout to Alpine for putting negative comments about their own car doing terribly..."", 'Merc, Ferrari, Aston, and McLaren.\n\nAlpine was just so awful.', 'Aston Martin and McLaren.\n\nTems was the only musical guest I enjoyed, and I loved McLaren having their previous championship winning cars behind their latest one, although I must say that the Vodafone livery makes the current papaya and carbon fibre look.... amateurish.\n\nAlpine takes the award for the most improved livery, but also the worst presentation. What the hell was Bryan Tyler doing?', 'Kick reveal was really well done - really set the standard for the reveals that were to come.', ""Aston Martin's animation and presentation were gorgeous. McLaren was cool but it did them a disservice to show those beautiful old cars and then show this years mid one. \n\n\nAlpine was by far the worst but the car looks good."", 'I was in the arena so I might have a bit of a different perspective, as a few played more to the camera than us.\n\nSauber’s was really good to open with, it looked cool as hell in the arena. Also really liked Ferrari’s and the crowd loved Lewis in red.\n\nMy favourite team is Alpine but it’s a miss. If they’d gone all in with the ‘Rise Higher’ stuff from Instagram, I think it would have been good, but it ended up as Brian Tyler with waves and girls doing cordeliss behind him on screens.\n\nHaas’ fell flat. VCARB fell very flat. Red Bull’s was purely for cameras, not for us - the booing was fun though.', 'Tens and the violins was such a refreshing change.
