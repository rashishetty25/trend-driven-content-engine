But I think everything compensated, and even when I went to Le Mans, the second Le Mans, we were two minutes behind the leader one hour before the end and then they had a puncture, then they had a wheel that was not properly done, then they had a double pit stop ... then I won the second Le Mans.

While I agree Alonso has been unlucky not to win more championships, he was also fortunate to pick up the titles in 2005 and 2006. Max Mosley and Bernie Ecclestone never liked seeing one team dominate, and when Schumacher and Ferrari started winning almost every race in 2002, the FIA began looking for ways to rein them in. The qualifying format was switched to single-lap runs, which exposed Ferrari’s weakness with tire warm-up and limited Schumacher’s usual strategy of starting heavier on fuel. The points system was also revised to keep the championship battle closer for longer. Things got so extreme after 2002 that Mosley even floated ideas like adding ballast to the championship-winning car or reversing the starting grid.\n\nThe real turning point for Ferrari came with the one-tire rule in 2005. It was no secret that Bridgestones degraded faster than Michelins, and the regulation change effectively swung the advantage toward Micheli supplied teams. That allowed Renault and Alonso to capitalize, even though Ferrari still had a strong,if tricky car. Renault’s rapid engine development also paid off when V10s were banned in 2006. Had Ferrari been able to carry its early-2000s advantage forward, it’s an open question whether Alonso would have still won those two titles.', ""The starts those Renaults had back then were crazy.

We're racing again on the most demanding race track in the world! Join us for race 9 of the Nürburgring Endurance Series of 2025 on the Nordschleife. Over 100 race cars are going on a four-hour hunt for points and trophies.  
  
In different classes, fast GT3 cars with around 500 hp, robust touring cars and identical cup cars fight for victory in their class. In the top class, GT3 cars from Porsche, Mercedes-AMG, Audi, BMW and others compete for overall victory.  
  
The Nürburgring Endurance Series races on the legendary Nordschleife - the longest permanent race track in the world.  
The 24-kilometre track leads through the middle of the Eifel forests, was built more than 90 years ago and leaves hardly any room for driving errors. No wonder that former Formula 1 world champion Jackie Stewart once called it the ""Green Hell"".
