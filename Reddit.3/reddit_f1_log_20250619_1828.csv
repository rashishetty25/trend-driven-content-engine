The titles are beyond them but if this upgrade can let them get a win or two and create some momentum while they focus on 2026 that would be a pretty good outcome.', 'These regs have sucked so bad for upgrades. Most teams don‚Äôt improve much after upgrades. Even Red Bull has failed in some upgrades. The only ones who were able to get them consistently right was McLaren and they‚Äôre the fastest for it. Mercedes, Red Bull, Ferrari have all made upgrades that don‚Äôt seem to go anywhere.\n\nLet‚Äôs not even bring Aston into the conversation.

The two drivers are publicly saying updates are needed, the tp is saying they're shit + the engineers are shit. The drivers seem to have no clue when updates will happen, the tp is giving vague hints about some coming. Keeping secrets from the drivers like they've signed for the competitors"", "">actually only need to find a few tenths to give themselves a chance\n\nIt's a lot closer at the front than people seem to think, one good upgrade can put any of Red Bull/Mercedes/Ferrari competing with McLaren regularly.

Has there ever been one?\n\nDoesn't have to be 24ht endurance. In Aus our famous race is the Bathurst 1000. 1000km of good tough racing.\n\nCould bring back a fuel pit stop, driver changes (although not so sure how easy that is in F1, so other option could be driver/car swap... Downside to that though is it allows a fresh car at each swap rather than a car that's done 560km with 340km to go) and great strategy.\n\nOne option could be for teams to just race 1 car and have their drivers share the drive.\n\nOther option is for teams to have 2 cars, use the F1 driver as a main driver and have an F2 or backups or whatever as the secondary driver.\n\nOr allow team to chose what they want.\n\nJust don't do it on a track like Monaco... Needs to be a track that has good overtaking prospects and long enough to allow good racing."", 'I just updated my f1 app and now it isn‚Äôt working on the iOS 26 beta.
