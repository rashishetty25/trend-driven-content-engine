This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

Remember to keep it civil and welcoming! Gatekeeping within the Daily Discussion will subject users to disciplinary action.

Has there ever been one?\n\nDoesn't have to be 24ht endurance. In Aus our famous race is the Bathurst 1000. 1000km of good tough racing.\n\nCould bring back a fuel pit stop, driver changes (although not so sure how easy that is in F1, so other option could be driver/car swap... Downside to that though is it allows a fresh car at each swap rather than a car that's done 560km with 340km to go) and great strategy.\n\nOne option could be for teams to just race 1 car and have their drivers share the drive.\n\nOther option is for teams to have 2 cars, use the F1 driver as a main driver and have an F2 or backups or whatever as the secondary driver.\n\nOr allow team to chose what they want.\n\nJust don't do it on a track like Monaco... Needs to be a track that has good overtaking prospects and long enough to allow good racing."", 'I just updated my f1 app and now it isn’t working on the iOS 26 beta. Can anyone confirm if this is happening on the beta only or is it widespread?', 'What if Antonelli gets a podium in the us he is only 18 and the legal drinking age in the us is 21 does he have to walk off the podium right after the national anthems or can he join the champagne party', ""Your wiki hasn't been updated for this year :/ Suppose I just need to visit some official F1 site or just google for the dates and other details"", 'If the regs didn\'t change, and max got on the phone to McLaren being like ""i want to drive for you"" would they take him? And if yes, who would they kick out?\n\nI would say any other team would immediately kick someone out, McLaren Is the only one where, yes, one of the two could be shown the door , but they might not be rushing to sing Max', 'Do you think if Madrid GP constructions will finish until 2026 season? A sports journalist from my country reported in his column that he was at Madrid recently and the construction of Madrid GP doesn’t look promising, there is no track at all & this may cause a delay in order to obtain necessary approvals& licences from the committees.
