""And the way in which you

generate laptime is a way that comes relatively naturally for Lando, and less naturally for Oscar. Lando is the driver of going on low grip, end of the stint when the tyres are quite worn, the grip is low - it's where we see Lando go green sector, green sector, green sector. Oscar, instead, is more of a driver of high grip. That's where he can exploit this incredible talent.","['In COTA Tom Stallard recommended that Oscar should use the combined more on entry like the other car (i.e. Lando) based on ""learnings from quali"".\xa0\n\n\nI believe (but could be wrong)\xa0this refers to combined throttle/brake application, which is supposed to help stabilize the car through corners.\n\n\nMaybe Oscar struggling more with this technique is why he has a harder time on low grip circuits where the car is a bit ""snappier""?\xa0', ""He did poorly in America last year as well, let's see what it's like in Las Vegas"", ""A reasonable explanation by Stella tbh, but it's easier to create conspiracy theories instead of reading I guess"", 'My guess is that he needs more ""feel"" at the front end on more slippery tracks, which is what Lando asked for and got earlier in the season but Oscar felt he didn\'t need.', 'So Oscar doesn’t like low grip. Is it safe to say this doesn’t bode well for next season considering the tires are smaller and likely will have lower grip?', 'Lol at all the comments suggesting conspiracy. Piastri has been shit in COTA and Mexico last year, same this year. Why it is so hard to believe that this is skills issue?', 'No! The obvious and true answer is that Oscar’s car has been sabotaged to let lando win the championship!\n\n/s', 'I thought the best drivers are the ones that can perform in difficult conditions', 'That sounds super reasonable. And Lando is very frequently fastest on track at the end of stints. Not just at COTA. \n\nAnd his first point about the car needing to be driven a certain way makes sense too. The competition and engineering is at such a high level, it really is coming down to the driver in those last couple tenths. You can see it in how at least in the past, Redbull had made a very pointed car which Max was able to adjust to better than any other team mate. Albon explains this in his interview about it. And as you watch your team mate excel more and more your confidence begins to crack. I think we are seeing in Piastri something similar. His onboards are so timid and nervous now.', ""I absolutely love this current theme of F1 drivers blaming anything but themselves when something doesn't go to plan.

I did this to show the performance throughout the season. The higher up the line is on the graph, the higher finishing position the driver had. This is designed to show when the drivers have had good runs of form and also dips in there results. The first 4 races are just an average of all the races up until that point as a 5 race average is not possible. e.g. the ""average"" for Australia is just the race results for that race as there was no previous races. This graph also does not take sprint races into account and only the drivers' Grand Prix finishing position. DNFs are counted as the drivers' classified position. e.g. I put Lando down as P18 in canada as he was the last car to DNF but Oscar P20 in Azerbaijan as he DNFed on the first lap 

Lando in the dark orange had a very good start to the season winning the opening round. His average tailed off slightly losing the lead for the champion to Oscar after the Saudi Arabian GP. His results then stayed around the same until Spain where they dropped off heavily after a DNF in Canada. His average was then down after that race as even though he was getting podiums, the DNF skewed his average. This is then compounded by the DNF in the Dutch GP after which he hasn't got a win since.

Oscar didn't have a great start to the season finishing P9 in Australia but his performances picked up and as he won the next race in China, After which he only finished off the podium once up until Azerbaijan where he DNFed and has not got on the podium since which as brought down his average significantly.

Max had a good start to the season but his average finish was slowly declining until is dramatically dropped off after he was taken out by Kimi Antonelli on the first lap in Austria. His average then stayed low until the Italian GP after which it has been on a sharp incline. This shows that his form in recent races has picked up and that his is now closing the gap to Lando and Oscar in the championship.","['The hungry grand prix, yummy', 'Piastri completely dominated the European stretch in the middle of the season. \n\nYou can see the DNFs for Max at Austria, Norris at Canada, and Piastri at Baku.  \n\nWhat a tear Max has been on since Monza.', ""I don't think you should be counting the races where they didn't finish towards an average FINISHING position stat imo. \n\nAnd if you're talking about their CLASSIFIED position, then you shouldn't be counting Piastri's DNF in Baku and Verstappen's in Austria, as neither was classified."", 'If Max loses the Championship this year by less than 9 points, he’s going to regret that bone headed decision to crash into George in Spain.', 'How did Lando’s go so low?

And that even though Verstappen beat Clark in 5 of the 6 metrics. Clark leads Verstappen only in the relative championship lead, since he beat championship ""rival"" Graham Hill with 73 to 29 points, and so had Clark 152% the points of Hill in comparison to Verstappen's 101.8% lead to Teammate Sergio Perez.

Numbers for Win %, % of HPP, Avg. Finish, % Points Lead and % Podium come from the respective Wikipedia articles for the F1 championships from 1950 to 2024.  
Numbers for Laps Lead % come from [statsf1.com](http://statsf1.com) .

HPP stands for Highest Possible Points, so how many points you'd have if you won every race of the season.

The Numbers for the Average Finishing Position were calculated as following:

* Getting the Average of all Grand Prix Finishing Positions,
* Multiplying that Average by 10,
* Subtracting that number from 100.

In the case of an average finishing position higher than P10, the value will be 0.

Wins are counted as part of the podium.","['I feel like adding percentages to everything and then also to points in front is misleading.

So naturally the difference is a lot larger in percentage.', ""I'm astonished Jim Clark's 1965 season, where he won every race he finished and took three Grand Slams, is in the bottom half of most dominant season. The first F1 race that season which Clark entered but failed to win was round 8 of 10. In fact round 8 (the Italian Grand Prix) was the first time all season somebody had managed to complete even one lap ahead of Clark. If that season can be ranked as less dominant than a whole bunch of much tighter seasons then the methodology must be deeply flawed."", 'Why are we just picking random stats and adding percentages (a lethal sin) without any weighing and pretending it means something?', 'Clark is the GOAT for me.
