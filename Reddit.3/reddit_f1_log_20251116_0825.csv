I’m intrigued as to the exact same question but race wins. Because this race has Lewis’s at the time 90ish, Sebs 52, and Perez’s 0, so thats 140-150ish. 

Is this the highest? Max is on 65, Lewis 105 and Lec/Pia/Nor are 10ish. So they could easily beat it if Lewis could make it to the podium in a Ferrari.
