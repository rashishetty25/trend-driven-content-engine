On paper Norris still has the strongest position with his points lead, but the situation is a lot more fragile than it looks.

McLaren’s DSQ in Vegas changed everything. Since the floor was ruled illegal they need to run the car more carefully. They cannot push the downforce window as far as before. That affects qualifying, tyre management, race pace and confidence. On top of that Max still runs a newer engine while McLaren are stretching an older unit. The risk of a technical issue sits more on the orange side of the garage.

Max can attack without fear. Norris has everything to lose. That changes how both drive in wheel to wheel fights. Max is proven under pressure. We have seen him in these situations many times. He keeps the car tidy. He delivers when it matters. Norris has made mistakes this season under stress. Same for Piastri. Both are fast. Both deserve to be here. But both lost points because they pushed a bit too hard when the pressure was high.

Piastri is the wild card. A few races ago he looked out of it. Now he is right back in the fight. He can afford to take risks because he is not the one with the lead. He can swing for a win. That brings chaos into play. If Norris and Piastri end up battling each other too hard it opens the door for Max to do exactly what he does best. Stay clean. Stay calm. Pick up the points. And grab a fifth title.

So the real question for the last two rounds is simple. Who handles pressure best. Norris with the target on his back. Piastri with nothing to hold back. Or Max with the chance to punish every mistake in front of him.","["">Max can drive without fear.\n\nWhile yeah. Max is always going to be driving like a madman now. But 1 DNF for him and it's over for him as well. All three can't risk a DNF now. If anything, Norris is the only one that *could* survive a DNF in this title fight."", ""Lando still has a huge advantage. All he has to do is not do anything too silly and not get involved in drama and he's got it in the bag. I know F1 media will try to make it look like WW2, but honestly it's not that close. If he managed 2 clean first laps then he's this year's WDC"", ""Norris doesn't need to win any races or do anything special. As long as he brings it home on the podium he's champion. He has a 24pt lead and if Max (or Oscar) win both races and the sprint he only loses 23pts by finishing third in all the events"", ""Meh, as much as I am enjoying the chaos and would love Max to get the fifth title, Lando just needs to mind to not make mistakes. Las Vegas has not been McLaren friendly circuit since it came back on the calendar. The last two circuits should be good for them.\n\nOf course, never discount the team fucking up but otherwise, this should be in Lando's hands by the end."", ""> Since the floor was ruled illegal they need to run the car more carefully\n\nThis has been mentioned a bunch since the DSQ, but has there been any quotes or evidence that McLaren were doing it intentionally or is it speculation?\n\nIt's not like McLaren had issues in Brazil or Mexico related to porpoising or the floor."", 'All Norris has to do is outscore both Piastri and Max by 2 points in Qatar and he’s done.', 'Even if Lando is P3 and Max P1 all races, Lando still wins. He just needs to bring it home and not take stupid risks.

Even if Max wins and Norris only gets a podium finish (I don't think McLaren will be any lower down the standings, and Qatar shouldn't be a difficult race to produce crazy results), he'll arrive in Abu Dhabi with a 14-18 point advantage. Potentially, a sixth or seventh place would be enough for him even if Max wins. Considering that only the Mercedes and Ferraris could occupy positions P2 to P5, he'd have it in the bag barring a very unusual race (Abu Dhabi isn't usually a race with crazy results either)."", 'We all know that Max was a big winner from Vegas but I’d argue Piastri was a winner in that it keeps him within 25 points of Lando.\n\nWould be absolutely bonkers if Max wins Qatar, Piastri is second and Lando comes 10th (unlikely). Would have Max and Lando on equal points. Piastri 7 points behind.

1p5ejcx,"The Evolution, Impact, and Legacy of Ground Effect in Formula One",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p5ejcx/the_evolution_impact_and_legacy_of_ground_effect/,2025-11-24, Technical,"Ground effect stands for one of the most significant aerodynamic breakthroughs in the history of Formula One. Its emergence in the late 1970s, later ban in the early 1980s, and controlled reintroduction in the 2022 regulations collectively show the complex interplay between engineering innovation, competitive advantage, and regulatory oversight. This essay examines the historical development of ground effect, the technical principles behind its success, the challenges that led to its prohibition, and its influence on modern Formula One design.

Early Aerodynamic Approaches in Formula One and their Evolution led by Colin Chapman

During the 1950s and early 1960s, aerodynamic optimisation in Formula One was minimal. Cars were designed primarily for reduced drag, with narrow tyres, high ride heights, and front-mounted engines. While this configuration produced high straight-line speeds, it offered limited stability and poor cornering performance. As the decade progressed, technological shifts—such as wider tyres, rear-mounted engines, and lowered ride heights—enhanced mechanical grip and stability, but aerodynamic understanding remained rudimentary.
A change in design philosophy occurred in 1968 with the introduction of aerodynamic wings. These early devices were unstable and sometimes hazardous, yet they showed off the effect of downforce on cornering capability. By the 1970s, front and rear wings had become fundamental components of car design, although they were primarily “top-mounted” solutions that did not meaningfully exploit airflow beneath the car. Colin Chapman, founder of Lotus, played a pivotal role in the development of ground effect. By the mid-1970s, Lotus had fallen behind its rivals, prompting Chapman and his engineering team to explore more radical aerodynamic strategies. Inspired by the Venturi principles seen in aircraft design, they theorised that shaping the car’s underbody like an inverted aerofoil could drastically increase downforce. Wind-tunnel testing confirmed their theory. By integrating Venturi tunnels within the sidepods and sealing the airflow with sliding skirts, Lotus created a low-pressure zone beneath the car that effectively “sucked” it to the track without the drag penalty associated with large wings. This marked the birth of ground effect in Formula One.

The Emergence of a New Aerodynamic Era pioneered by Lotus

Introduced in 1977, the Lotus 78 became the first Formula One car engineered specifically around ground-effect principles. Its extended wheelbase and enlarged sidepods housed the Venturi structures responsible for the car’s unprecedented performance. Although the design suffered from uneven pressure distribution and mechanical reliability issues, it proved the enormous competitive potential of under-body aerodynamics which would be built upon in further seasons. 
The 1978 Lotus 79 was a more refined example of the ground-effect concept. Engineers extended the Venturi tunnels and redesigned the rear suspension to stabilise airflow across a wider range of conditions. The car achieved extraordinary dominance, securing six victories, near-total qualifying superiority, and the World Championship for Mario Andretti. The Lotus 79’s success compelled rival teams to develop their own ground-effect solutions, marking a rapid escalation in aerodynamic innovation.

Competing Interpretations and Engineering Experiments

Several teams tried alternative applications of ground-effect principles, with varying degrees of success. Among the most notable was the Brabham BT46B “fan car,” which used an engine-driven fan to extract air from beneath the chassis. This produced immense downforce irrespective of vehicle speed and resulted in a dominant victory in its sole race. Although technically legal, the car was withdrawn due to political pressure within the sport. Other experimental designs—including Arrows’ inclined-engine venturi system and Ligier’s high-downforce bodywork—showed promise but lacked the refinement necessary for consistent competitiveness. These efforts nevertheless highlighted the diversity of engineering approaches stimulated by the ground-effect revolution.

Porpoising and the Safety Crisis

Despite its performance advantages, ground effect introduced new safety concerns. To maintain an airtight under-floor seal, cars were fitted with extremely stiff suspension systems that severely compromised ride comfort and stability. This rigidity, combined with variations in airflow, led to “porpoising”—a violent vertical oscillation caused by cyclical loss and reattachment of downforce, an issue that also became clear during the 2022 Formula 1 season. By 1981, porpoising had become a major hazard, and regulatory interventions followed. Sliding skirts were banned on safety grounds, and minimum ride-height regulations were introduced. Teams initially circumvented these rules through hydropneumatic suspension systems, but the FIA ultimately mandated fully flat bottoms for the 1983 season, effectively ending the ground-effect era.

The Reintroduction of Ground Effect in 2022

Ground effect returned to Formula One in 2022 under a new regulatory framework designed to improve racing quality. Modern cars incorporate controlled Venturi tunnels but lack sliding skirts, making the aerodynamic load less extreme and more predictable. While these designs significantly reduce turbulent wake, they have also reintroduced porpoising to a lesser but still notable extent. Teams such as Mercedes experienced pronounced oscillations early in the season, highlighting the enduring complexities of managing under-floor aerodynamics.

Conclusion

Ground effect stands as a defining chapter in Formula One’s technological evolution. From its pioneering development by Lotus in the 1970s to its eventual ban and controlled revival decades later, it proves the tension between innovation and regulation in motorsport. Its legacy continues to shape modern car design, offering valuable lessons about aerodynamic optimisation, safety, and the pursuit of competitive advantage. As the 2022 regulations show, the foundational ideas of ground effect remain as relevant today as they were nearly half a century ago.

1p5uq5n,How do you rate drivers?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p5uq5n/how_do_you_rate_drivers/,2025-11-24, Discussion,"How do you rate drivers?

In F1 spaces, there's a pretty strong consensus over where each driver relatively ranks. This post was prompted by [this discussion post asking who would be closest Max in the second RBR seat](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p5ftxx/which_driver_from_the_current_grid_would/), where there's a clear favorite answer (Charles) and then some runners-up (George, Fernando, and Lando a few times), which seems to be about the usual ranking.

But like...how do you guys know? I get that different drivers have demonstrated fantastic W2W skill or pace or raw speed, but these things are obviously affected by the car. When comparing drivers who have never been teammates, e.g. Russell vs. Leclerc, in your mind, how do you compensate for machinery? Like, I don't think I could say George *wouldn't* have done even better than Charles in the 2022 Ferrari, or that Charles wouldn't have more race wins than George in the 2025 Mercedes. 

I guess related: where does the consensus in the relative quality of cars come from? This season, with all the VCARB/RBR shenanigans, I've heard that the RBR has a higher ceiling but the VCARB is easier to drive. But based on what we know (everyone not Max has done better in the VCARB than the RBR), it seems equally possible that Verstappen is just car Jesus who  would have won the championship in the VCARB and the RBR without him would be a backmarker—not saying this is true or I believe it, but it doesn't necessarily seem *less* true than the current popular opinion.

I think the boring answer is that fans will naturally reach consensus (especially with new fans coming in and learning about past seasons via memes/stories) and that F1 is fundamentally not a sport where you can compare drivers like that, but I might be/probably am missing something. So how do you compare drivers and cars?","[""Vibes\n\nAnd consider how they're performing compared to their teammates, how consistent they are, and in relation to the team/car's recent performances.\n\nBut mostly vibes."", ""it's pure vibes, but most people vibe similarly, especially when they're not die-hard fans of any driver or team\n\nI'd say most people would agree max is, at the moment (and for the past few seasons), the strongest driver on the grid. \n\nOscar and lando were pretty close to eachother at the start of the year but oscar losing confidence as of late and lando REALLY hitting his stride in the last few races"", 'There are many factors, here\'s a few that work in Charles\' favour:\n\n1. Consistency\n2. Raw qualy pace\n3. Comparison with team mates\n4. F2/F3 results (Charles has a phenomenal F2 season)\n\nThere are also reasons you may favour George or Lando, but regardless, all these factors are weighted (they don\'t all count equally), get updated every race, and we combine it all into personal ""vibes"".\n\nThat\'s to say that while ""vibes"" is correct, it\'s definitely a massive oversimplification. It does also capture that there can be bias.', ""This is Reddit, we rate drivers based on whether we like them or not. When drivers that we like do well, we say it's skills. When drivers that we don't like do well, we say it's the car.\n\nI am joking but at the same time I am not lol"", ""It's tough, you cant REALLY, definitively and quantitatively really compare drivers. Even in NFL with all their stats, sometimes the numbers dont tell the whole story; maybe someone isnt putting up big numbers in TD's pr recieving yards, but they're still playing a big part in their teams performance. If you cant really quantify exactly two NFL players, with all their billions of stats, we've no chance to really quantify F1 drivers in different machinery, lol.\n\nBut everyone does it anyway, you just see how someone performs race after race, over a whole season. For a better read though you need a couple seasons. Like Albon I felt was higher up in earlier years, but this seson, even though he's had some great performances, hes made a bunch of silly mistakes and crashed unnecessarily, kinda brings him down a tiny bit.\n I'd say you rate them based on a number of diff variables, hows their qualy, how do they develop over a weekend, how do they compare to their teammate, what do the drivers and team say about the car (easy or difficult to drive, really sharp balance that snaps on you, then you give them more leeway, or like verstappen, if they dominate in that cars is all the more impressive), how they do in qualy, how they deal with pressure, how they bounceback from shitty weekends, etc"", ""I don't have much of an answer, I just base it based on their performance, over their entire career and current.\n\nFor example everyone would agree Verstappen is certainly the best right now. Then it's often Russell and Leclerc in the picture for 2/3, but I've found it's not nearly as unanimous as you'd think, in fact, earlier today  someone replied to me saying Russell is nowhere near the best. Which looking at his career, seems wild to me, but it's a good example of people letting their biases get in the way of how they rate drivers.\n\nAfter that? Well rn I'd say Norris, but after that it gets a bit harder to determine, I still don't think Piastri is far off, earlier in the season I'd swap them around, but he's still not far off. I'm really not sure how I'd put everyone else, kinda ebbs and flows, Bearman and Antonelli are up there, Hadjar and Gasly have their moments, and so on, though Tsunoda, as much as I love him, is probably bottom, not entirely his fault mind, but there's so much talent rn, it has to be someone."", 'Raw Pace + Race Pace & Quali Pace consistency over every weekend + Racecraft\n\nRight now Max is the best imo as he has the raw pace, he is the most consistent over the weekends overall on the grid and he has good racecraft on top of that', ""When they have a car that's competitive and fits them do they Maximize."", 'Well, whoever wins the championship this year will be the best.

1p5dxip,ELI5: What was Lewis thinking?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p5dxip/eli5_what_was_lewis_thinking/,2025-11-24, Discussion,"For a guy who built his career and strength on breaking late, I can't imagine how he thought moving to a team that uses engine breaking so much would make sense - I feel like by definition engine breaking is less controllable. And such a driving style, it's not just something you can change at 40, in a sport where mm and ms matter so much. Was he aware he wouldn't have been able to perform at his top? Did he not know they use different brakes in Ferrari? Was he overly optimistic in thinking he would adapt fast? Did he think (like Sainz thought, like we all thought) that Ferrari was going to be a title contender and the breaking issues would have been compensated by other strengths? Was it mostly a PR/money move, or the ability of saying ""I drove for Ferrari""?

Of course, I'm being a bit of Cpt. Hindsight here.

You're not wrong. Hamiltons speed was built on late braking. And lately many of Ferraris issues have been brake related. But I think the main problem was that after Hamilton won the sprint at the beginning of the season they realised the had an issue with ride height and the speed of the car was designed to be maximised at the low height. As soon as they raised the height the had a different car on their hands. I didnt expect Lewis to be as fast as Charles straight away but the issues with the car means he has never felt good driving it. And to be frank Charles hasn't been happy all season either.

I am often reminded of what I hear some people throwing around: “Las Vegas is just better Monaco” and honestly I’m starting to agree. After this third running it seem clear to me that Vegas will stand as an exciting track to race while also being made all the more intriguing with its placement at the end of the calendar.

I don’t want more events on the calendar to be handled like Vegas but as an outlier I really enjoy it for what it is. 

However, I really feel like all this pomp and circumstance makes way more sense as the season finale than this awkward third-to-last slot.
