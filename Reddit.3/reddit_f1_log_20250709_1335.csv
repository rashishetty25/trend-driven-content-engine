In the past days we received a lot of requests for special flairs celebrating Hulkenberg's podium.

So in order to properly commemorate this historic event we decided to create a limited edition flair, featuring a limited edition emoji made by u/Blanchimont.   
  
This flair can only be claimed in the next 27 hours. So if you want to have proof so that you can brag to all the future members of the community that you were here when history was made, this is your chance. If you change your flair back after the 27 hours you will not be able to recover the limited edition flair.  
  
To claim this flair all you have to do is to send a comment under this post including the words ""Hulkenpodium"" or ""Hulkengoat"" (and pray that AutoModerator doesn't crash and burn)

If a driver didn’t participate in qualifying at all, didn’t set a time, or their time was dropped for a violation of the technical regulations, that weekend wasn’t included and is listed as a DNQ in the table.

**Qualifying Time Differential:** Uses the time from the last qualifying session in which both drivers participated. For example, if one driver made it to Q2 and the other was knocked out in Q1, the Q1 time is used for both.

**Use of Average (Mean) for Qualifying Gap to Teammate:** Because the chart for qualifying gaps uses an average, some drivers were helped or hurt by a single bad qualifying session. The two most extreme examples in each direction are:

* Oscar Piastri crashed during Q3 of the 2023 Canadian GP due to weather, which meant that his lap for that session was 3.303 seconds slower than Lando Norris. If that qualifying session was dropped, he would only be 0.174 slower than Norris instead of 0.434.
*  Pierre Gasly’s teammate Brendon Hartley set a time that was 12.858 seconds slower during Q1 of the 2018 Azerbaijan GP. Without that qualifying session, Gasly would actually be 0.114 seconds slower than his teammates instead of 1.183 faster.","['Going a bit unnoticed, but Gabi is doing a great job, especially on qualis', '10 DNFs in Alonso’s first 12 race weekends lol\n\nI know it’s DNF by either drivers but that was just funny to see.', 'The key caveat is their teammates are not all equal, which makes comparisons hard.\n\nGeorge Russell’s rookie season 12-0 quali and 10-2 race H2H looks amazing, but his teammate was Robert Kubica returning after 8 years, and the Williams car that season was terrible.

1lvbg6m,Safety Car Restart Procedure,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lvbg6m/safety_car_restart_procedure/,2025-07-09, Discussion,"The SC restart procedure has always been a bugbear of mine. I feel there are so many better ways to do it that don't involve slowing down significantly to allow the SC to 'escape' - possibly losing tyre temps and just causing general havoc.

Surely there are better ways to restart?

Option 1 - Send the SC into the pit a lap early - at which point, all vehicles are under a Virtual Safety Car. Paint a new line towards the end of the lap, at which point the VSC ends - and the front driver is now the SC and can restart at any point as they do now, with no overtaking until the SC line. They no longer need to completely slow down to allow the SC to 'escape' to a safe distance. Problem with this approach is that at times it may add an extra lap. (Maybe not VSC - maybe speed limited is the better wording)

Option 2 - Move the SC line further into the track rather than at the pit lane exit - meaning the SC exits the track, and there is sufficient distance for the Pole sitter to restart without again having to slow down so much and create an artifical gap.

Probably many other ways to do it.","[""I think better communication would be enough. The problem at Silverstone was:\n\n* The call for the SC to come in was made late.\n* The teams didn't have any advanced knowledge the SC was going to be in that lap - the first the drivers knew was the lights going off.\n* Because they choose to bring the SC late they turned the lights off at a high speed part of the circuit, only Oscar could see the lights had gone out. Max didn't expect Oscar to slow to restart speeds (because he was unaware the SC was coming in).\n\nHad race control put the SC in notice out in the complex or - at worst- maggots and Becketts there would have been no issues. The SC would have had more time to escape, Oscar wouldn't have had to slow down to such a low speed to build a gap."", ""Option 1. The point of the VSC is that cars are to maintain the time gaps. This is obviously impossible at the end of the SC period when everyone is bunched together. The problem is track layout dependent. Any track with a substantial front straight tends to benefit the cars following the leader if the front car doesn't game the situation somewhat. You'd end up with the situation that many race leaders going into a SC lose their lead when SC ends and this is what the SC shouldn't really do.\n\nOption 2 is just confusing."", 'I like your options but I disagree that it solves the fundamental issue.\n\nThe problem is not that the SC has to “escape” because they really don’t have to. Under the current rules, once the SC light goes out the leader becomes the SC, so he can theoretically be chasing down the SC, so long he doesn’t overtake SC. \n\nThe problem is that the leader “feels the need” to get as much advantage as they can at restart, which means gaming the car(s) behind. I believe this is the thing to solve. At the moment, the way to do this (consistently) is to slow down and start at your own pace.\n\nThe problem this race is a combination of 2 things: safety car coming in message late (meaning leader cannot anticipate the SC light going out), plus Oscar continue accelerating and then slow down so abruptly AFTER SC lights go out. He could have coasted or follow SC closely, but that will diminish the advantage he could gain at restart.\n\nTLDR: there is no rule demanding the leader to “slow to restart speed” or let the SC escape. They do that to game the cars behind. That’s the real problem to solve.', ""> Problem with this approach is that at times it may add an extra lap.\n\nIt may? Mate, SC gets called in once it's safe to bring it in. Once that's happened, it'll almost always be safe to restart as well. You'd be delaying things by a lap in almost all cases of this.\n\n> meaning the SC exits the track, and there is sufficient distance for the Pole sitter to restart without again having to slow down so much and create an artifical gap. \n\nAlso, this frankly hasn't been a valid concern since they disallowed overtaking before the start finish line. Before that, you need to create a gap to ensure cars wouldn't be racing past a safety car that's still out on track. Nowadays, creating gaps and whatnot is purely done for gamesmanship.\n\nIf that bites someone in the ass, it's genuinely their own fault."", ""I don't get all the fuss about the safety car procedure just because Piastri did some dumb shit.\n\nThe safety car turned off the lights at the start of sector 3 as it is normal.\n\nPiastri doesn't have to restart into the first corner of sector 3. He doesn't need such a big gap. Usually at Silverstone restarts were done into vale or even as late as the exit onto the straight, not before stow.\n\nBut an easy solution would be: don't allow high speeds before safety car line 1.\n\nPS: safety car lines have multiple purposes. You can't just move them."", 'I like it how it is. It’s fun.', 'The SC doesn’t need to escape.

Just watched an Open Wheel Opinion video on Red Bull and she basically said Max is balancing the car on a knife’s edge like Senna used to able to and that’s the only reason it’s placing so high. I agree but think it’s even worse, as in I think Max would have the same results he has now at Haas or Williams. At one point Red Bull development drivers were like almost half of the grid so what has caused this change in culture or ability for them to develop drivers? Did they just quit once they got their max Verstappen and not realize that time marches onward? was wondering on other people’s thoughts on this as even commentators are saying this and fans for years have been arguing. ","[""verstappen is good, the best on the grid I'd say, but he's not a magician\n\nred bull's car is not good and it has an incredibly narrow and hard to extract performance window, so narrow that even max falls out of it sometimes, but the performance IS there when max can find it\n\nnow, the question is, does a car like the alpine, haas or williams also have a supper narrow performance window that nobody has managed to extract yet?\n\nthis also puts a larger question around how we rate car performance (or more accurately how it's basically impossible to objectively rate car performance), because if you put a driver pair like isack and liam into every car you'd probably see the redbull be significantly worse than the visa cashapp buy 1 get 1 free car, but if you put max and lewis in every car you'll probably see the running order significantly change, maybe they unlock crazy performance out of some cars but some others are just as shit as they look"", 'Max is a superb driver. He can extract a lot from a good car.

They promote solid, midfielders.', 'I think people tend to undersell the importance of time in the car. Max has been in the RB for almost 10 years, he’s driven it for every iteration as they’ve developed toward the car now. So it’s hard to drive for everyone, but Max hasn’t had to adapt so much. Whereas it must be jarring for other drivers joining the team.\n\nBut also idk 🤷\u200d♂️', ""Max is a racing freak but he is not god. You can't drive faster than the car will physically allow you, that is the ultimate pace or maximum potential of the car. The maximum potential of a car is no the same thing as how easy the car to drive or the car response to setup/ track/ weather changes. The car can be extremely fast but extremely sensitive or very easy to drive but lacking in maximum potential. \n\n  \nThat Red Bull car does have some speed to it, but its balance & operating window is so narrow that only Max Verstappen can adapt to it. Max Verstappen and the greatest drivers before him are very good at extracting the last potential of a car, but if the maximum potential of a car is lacking, i doubt he would be able to put it on pole and challenge for race win consistently at all.

1luxkb3,In equal machinery which driver do you think would win at each track?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1luxkb3/in_equal_machinery_which_driver_do_you_think/,2025-07-08, Discussion,"For some reason this thought popped into my mind while I was trying to get to sleep last night.

So I decided to go through each track this morning and who I thought would be most likely to win each race.

This is what I came up with,

Australia - Verstappen - tight with Norris. Albon and Alonso.

China - Russell - Prime Hamilton might win here, but Russell is quite underrated in China imo.

Japan - Verstappen - And it's not even close. 

Bahrain - Leclerc - He is spectacular in Bahrain. Shoutout to Gasly too.

Saudi Arabia - Piastri - This was a really hard one. Verstappen, Piastri, Leclerc and even Russell are all very good here. Piastri just beats Leclerc for me.

Miami - Verstappen - Very hard one to pick. Nobody seems to have always been clean in Miami. 

Imola - Verstappen - Verstappen has basically dropped a 10/10 performance every race he's driven in Imola. 

Monaco - Leclerc has been unlucky in the past  but is rapid around his streets. Shoutout to Ocon.

Spain - Verstappen did have a mad moment this year but it's not for a lack of pace. Prime Lewis might beat him but he was underwhelming this year so Max takes it.

Canada - Verstappen - Russell is good in Montreal, but this is a battle between he three world champions on the grid. Verstappen, Hamilton and Alonso. I'll give Max the edge because he's in his prime and he does not beat his team mates here, he destroys them.

Austria - Verstappen - I really wanted to give this one to Lando but Max's record here is incredible.

Britain - Hamilton - Verstappen and Norris are really good in Silverstone, but I have to pick Hamilton. 

Belgium - Verstappen - He seems to be driving on easy mode every time we come to Spa. Hamilton and Piastri are both very good here too.

Hungary - Hamilton - Lewis has been great here every race since 2017. Verstappen is very good too.

Netherlands - Verstappen - He's won here in 2021-2023 and then got a strong 2nd in 2024. Gasly is also very very good around Zandvoort. Lando and Fernando too.

Italy - Leclerc - Hamilton, Sainz, Leclerc, Russell. A good few very good drivers around Monza. I narrowed it down to Leclerc vs Hamilton. I guess we'll find out who's better this year. I'll go Leclerc (Shoutout to Ricciardo when he was in F1)

Azerbaijan - Leclerc - Perez not being on the grid makes this an easier choice. Leclerc is fabulous around Baku, especially in qualifying.

Singapore - Norris - Lando is fantastic around Singapore and every year he has raced in Singapore he's maximised his performance. 

USA - Verstappen has been incredible here ever since his rookie season. Norris and Hamilton (bar last year) are very good too.

Mexico - Verstappen - Another one of Max's great tracks. In fact Max has won by 12-20 seconds 5 seperate times in Mexico. (Shoutout to Ricciardo again when he was in F1, he was great around here)

Brazil - Verstappen - This is an interesting one. Hamilton used to be great here but he hasn't had a good race in Brazil since 2021. Verstappen is great in Interlagos, Russell is very good too, as are Norris and Sainz. 

Las Vegas - Leclerc - We've only had two races in Vegas so it's hard to choose. Gasly is great in Quali but had terrible race pace in 2023. I'll go with Leclerc as the best overall. His performance in 2023 was fabulous and he was still alright in 2024. 

Qatar - Verstappen - Verstappen and Russell are great around this circuit . Shoutout to Gasly again. Max just pips George for me courtesy of his race here last season.

Abu Dhabi - Verstappen - Leclerc, Hamilton, Verstappen, Sainz, Norris and even Tsunoda Quite a few drivers tend to impress in the final race of the year. Peak Hamilton might win here but as for right now it's between Verstappen and Norris. Max had an incident last year but it wasn't for lack of pace. He also won 4 races in a row from 2020-2023.
