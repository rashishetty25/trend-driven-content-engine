Despite his limited Grand Prix experience, he has the mental strength needed to drive alongside four-time Formula 1 world champion Max Verstappen and to accept that you have no chance against him.\n\n>It's a different story for Tsunoda. “We believe that it would lead to great difficulties emotionally if Tsunoda realized next to Max that he couldn't beat him, possibly couldn't even get close and things weren't going as he had imagined,” explained the Red Bull motorsport consultant.\n\n>Marko has already made an initial announcement to Lawson.

He topped every single practice session, Q1, Q2 and only missed out on pole position because Hamilton had 3 laps less fuel than him. Fuel corrected, he was on pole, also was 0.177 faster than Massa, having 3 laps more fuel than him (Massa made a mistake in the final corner though). \n\nHe was absolutely brilliant in the first stint, and was faster than Massa in 14 of the first 17 laps (As Massa pitted on the 17th lap of the race), despite having 3 laps more fuel than Massa. Pulled off 3 consecutive fastest laps, as Massa pitted and cut the gap to Hamilton from 8 to 4 seconds. And let's not forget, he did all of that in mixed conditions, so they were not dry at all. Also, Massa was running  3rd, just behind Raikkonen, so he has no excuse for roadblock or traffic as well. Both Raikkonen and Hamilton were left with the same set of wet tires after their stops, as they were not changed. Raikkonen conserved it better than Hamilton, and overtook him for the lead.\n\nA lot of people try to give Kubica a lot of credit for this race, but Heidfeld had 3 laps more fuel than Kubica, and still outqualified him. He was running ahead of Kubica as well, but Sauber pitted Heidfeld for the wet tires, while Kubica for the dry tires. Kubica got lucky that he pitted for dry tires at the right time, while Heidfeld had to pit after 4 laps again for the dry tires, so he lost all his advantage and dropped behind Kubica. Raikkonen pitted 8 laps after Kubica's stop for dry tires, and was only 3 seconds behind him. He had fresh tires, and with the car advantage, he would've won that race even then (In a case where Kubica got incredibly lucky). \n\nI know Raikkonen had some blisteringly quick/dominant drives in his McLaren years (Spain 2005, Monaco 2005, Silverstone 2004, France 2005 to name a few), but this one is so underrated because nobody talks about it at all.
