This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Like Im not necessarily talking your first race Im saying the race that made you say, “Im watching every race until I die.”\xa0\n\nMine was Germany 2019. I had got a guide book about 2018 season and previewing 2019 and I watched Australia and Bahrain and enjoyed them. But for some reason I stopped watching then and was kinda bored of Merc dominance I guess. Then randomly started watching Germany 2019 on the TV and watched from lap 15ish to the finish. Absolutely incredible. I would now say I’m in the top 1% of F1 fans amd it’s all thanks to that race. It helped that I supported Max at the time as well.\xa0\n\nSo what’s your memory of the race that got you hooked?', 'Massive shot in the dark but does anyone remember that F1 channel called “formulainsider01”? or something along those lines? It was from quite a few years ago, probably around 2017-18 he deleted his channel \n\nHe stood out because he would always have existential crisis in his videos descriptions, just a random memory from my early F1 days', 'Anyone have the clip where Lando/Oscar fucked off in the first sector after overtaking LEwis? I forgot either its saudi last year or singapore gp from last year', 'How is the feeling in Saudi Arabia about the race? Does it even get much attention in media?', 'Official F1 Store is running easter sale for anyone looking for cheap merch, https://f1store2.formula1.com/en/c-14672', ""Watching [the radio rewind from Abu Dhabi 2010](https://youtu.be/OscqgBj1HCw?si=1o3zd4LqUWqrQj2N) and, as a newer fan, I have a few questions about it. \n\n* At 2 minutes 17 seconds, I have a hard time understanding why Alonso is saying what he's saying. It sounds like he doesn't want Massa to overtake Webber (at least, during the current lap). Why? Or is it not that and I'm misunderstanding?     \n* Why did they include Hülkenberg talking about his front wing (58 seconds in)? It doesn't seem to be significant within the context of the video; is it a reference to something else I'm not aware of?     \n* At 3 minutes 3 seconds, Alguersuari's engineer is *clearly* giving him the same kind of team orders that Ferrari got busted for earlier in the season (ffs, they say the literal exact same words). Does it somehow not count because Alguersuari and Webber were technically on different teams (Toro Rosso and Red Bull respectively), or some other reason? Did somebody get popped for it and I just never heard about it? Or was it flat out missed/ignored?"", ""If Aston martin offers 300$ million to max, instead of doing this, why don't they use the 300Mil to develop their car, i'm pretty sure having a faster car will attract faster drivers anyway."", 'i cant get used to the change in the ending of the theme song.  i dont like it', 'who do you think had the fastest car in 1997 out of the Benetton, Sauber, Ferrari and Prost ?', ""There's a rumour that Redbull is running and begging Honda for the engine at least for 2026.\n\nRacing bulls would use then Red Bull Ford Engine""]",5,30,0.63,5,25,25,-2,1,-0.06999999999999995,-2
