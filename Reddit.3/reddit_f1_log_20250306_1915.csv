1j4trr4,The 'risky' McLaren F1 2025 choice that caught Red Bull's eye,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j4trr4/the_risky_mclaren_f1_2025_choice_that_caught_red/,2025-03-06, News,,"['Well this explains one reason for their improved slow corner performance compared to last year, at least during preseason testing. The front suspension of an F1 car is designed to keep the car stable under braking. One way teams achieve this is by using an “anti-dive” suspension layout (like in the MCL39), which reduces how much the car’s nose dips forward during braking. But this design choice comes with a trade-off. In a normal suspension setup, the forces from braking and cornering are spread out more evenly across the suspension components. Whereas with an anti-dive layout, certain parts of the suspension (higher-up) take on much greater forces because they are working harder to resist that forward movement of the car. This puts more stress on the components and the only way to make this design reliable is to use stronger materials potentially making it a bulkier setup.', '> In fact, Red Bull technical director Pierre Wache made an eyebrow-raising observation in Bahrain - in suggesting that McLaren may have taken a bit of a gamble with its front suspension.\n\n> Speaking to The Race, Wache said: “The suspension of the McLaren is very interesting – in terms of kinematics. And one aspect is the anti-dive. It is very high.\n\n> ""It is quite a risky kinematic for me. If they can make it work, it will be interesting.”\n\n> Asked what he meant by it being risky, Wache said: “In terms of the load on the suspension legs and everything.”\n\nThe Race then proceeds to explain what Pierre means in detail, key takeaway:\n\n> And it is this layout that Wache thinks could pose some risks – with the anti-dive layout perhaps exposing the individual suspension components to much greater structural forces than a more normal suspension layout would have.\n\n> This could pose headaches in terms of opening up potential reliability problems, but also perhaps require compromises in needing to bulk up individual components to make sure they are strong enough. That has weight consequences.', 'So.... Something something car loses front wheels at the end of straight....\n\nPierre knows something about that I think.', 'I suppose I would trust the McLaren engineers who designed it and presumably tested it, over the Red Bull ones who simply got to look at it, but… we will see how it works out! The McLaren looked lightning fast in testing, hopefully reliability doesn’t take a step back.', ""If there's one team I'd put my money on understanding composites and their ability to take dynamic forces well, it would be the team that introduced the first carbon fiber F1 chassis and 'mini-DRS'. Even if it's risky, you don't win in F1 by playing safe."", ""The question of suspension kinematics has something to do with structural integrity, but the biggest concern is driver feedback, wasn't it?"", 'That MCL38 vs MCL39 dissected comparison would make an amazing interactive compare view thing where you have the slider to drag back and forth over the car.

At the same time Hamilton, Max, Seb and other WDC winners have benefited from having a strong car. That shouldn’t take anything away from their achievements either because you could have the best car but being unable to extract what the car provides could hurt you.

But using data (or otherwise), is there a good way of estimating the impact of someone’s skills as a driver and how that eventually impacts their standings on the grid?

I’m big into statistics within Formula One, but lap times and other metrics also have the factor of the car’s strengths/weaknesses baked into it so it’s hard to quantify how someone is really performing. It would be easy if everyone had the same machinery (Like Alonso once suggested ha!).

The drivers on the grid are so competitive, that the difference between them might be smaller than what we perceive. The simplest comparison for me so how you fare against your teammate, but then again it’s in a limited sphere of a single team.

Thanks and would love to hear folks’ thoughts on this.","['Depends on if I like the driver or not.', ""I don't think we truly can. Too many race-affecting variables to consider,  and a lot of secrecy around the cars and drivers. Also, sometimes it really is down to luck, for better or worse."", ""You basically can't, so we search for the next best thing(s). Are they consistent? Do they beat their teammates? How do they perform in changeable weather conditions? How does the rest of the paddock talk about them?"", 'I imagine team principals have a good idea on who is truly skilled and what not based on all the data they have. Truly generational or skilled drivers will always stand out no matter what car they are in.', 'Junior record, comparison vs teammates and the teammates comparison vs other drivers, your judgement on the speed and driveability of the car etc.', 'From the outside, there\'s really not much we can do. We can see the teammate comparisons and when driver moves team, you can correlate them.\n\nBut that is not precise science at all, there are probably another hundreds of variables to take into consideration: driver\'s familiarity with their car, how much does their car suit the driver\'s default driving style, how much does a certain track suit the car and how much does the track suit the driver, how good the setup works are from their team, driver\'s own growth over the years, as well as normal fluctuation in their form...\n\nSo if you were to quantify this, a certain driver\'s ""power score"" might be ""91.2 +/- 1.5"" and another driver\'s might be ""89.7 +/- 3.6"" (numbers don\'t mean anything -- I\'m just using it to make the point). That errorbar depends on all those factors mentioned above. The 89.7 driver may very well seem to be better than the 91.2 driver because he\'s driving a car more suited to him. So in many cases, we might think the driver is  worse (better) than he really is because he never get to drive a car that suit (doesn\'t suit) his style.\n\nIf you\'re an engineer from a team, you have way more data and probably could break this down into much much more details, you\'d probably have insights like ""driver A is generally X% better than driver B in this type of corners, when the car is setup in this way"", and then you can probably do a weighted average to get the whole picture between driver A and driver B if you\'d like to\n\nWith the amount of lap time data we (as outsiders) have, you can probably do this analysis as well, but it probably will be so inaccurate that it really doesn\'t mean anything', ""fans probably don't know shit but drivers and team principles and those intermittently involved know"", 'It helps to see them drive in the wet. It’s a great leveller for most cars on the grid.', 'Mathematical models\n\n[https://f1metrics.wordpress.com/2019/11/22/the-f1metrics-top-100/](https://f1metrics.wordpress.com/2019/11/22/the-f1metrics-top-100/)', 'It’s only really possible to compare drivers who drive the same car i.e teammates, and even then you might find some inconsistencies due to one driver being better with a car that a particular characteristic. For example, Seb was faster than DR in the Red Bull during the blown diffuser era, but lost his advantage when the cars changed. I’d say the car accounts for 80% of the overall performance, and the driver 20%. It’s extremely rare when the best car doesn’t produce the drivers champion.\xa0']",10,43,0.66,10,242,242,-1,0,-0.029999999999999916,-1

If you slow the video down to x0.25 speed its easier to see. Lewis makes three distinct increases in steering angle on corner entry. Just after the third increase, you can see the car rotate more while he's maintaining that steering angle, and then right after, he makes the steering adjustment before hitting the apex and proceeding through the corner exit""]",12,7,0.83,12,7,7,2,2,0.04999999999999993,2
