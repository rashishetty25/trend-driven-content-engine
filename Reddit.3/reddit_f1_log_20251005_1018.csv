""At the start of the season, we had an advantage on many circuits, but the field is now closer together. Although I think that in the remainder of the season, the circuits in Brazil, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi will suit our car well. It\'s no surprise to me that Red Bull is also doing well here in Singapore, on a circuit where they have often struggled. It\'s still Red Bull, an extremely capable team.
