It’s fascinating to see what people’s opinions were at the time compared to not only what ended up happening in 2022 but how the picture evolved through the era.

Meanwhile, there were doubts about McLaren, which ended up being true before they were able to completely turn around and have dominated this season as a constructor.

Obviously there are much more moving parts this time—literally, thanks to active aero—with the engine formula changing as well.

1p6bcc3,[OC] Probability Distribution of 2025 Final Championship Points: Verstappen vs. Norris (Qatar Sprint to Abu Dhabi),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p6bcc3/oc_probability_distribution_of_2025_final/,2025-11-25, Statistics,"I’ve been playing around with the points permutations for the final three races of the season and built a probability distribution for Verstappen vs Norris from the Qatar Sprint to Abu Dhabi.

# Analysis

* Each remaining race gives a range of possible points for each driver (0 to 25 for a race, 0 to 8 for a sprint).
* I treated every finishing position as equally likely.
* I generated all combinations of results across the remaining weekends.
* For each combination, I calculated the driver’s total season points.
* Then I created a probability distribution based off all the combinations available.

The chart shows the final distribution for both drivers. The overlap area between the curves represents the chance that Verstappen finishes ahead of Norris in total points.

Verstappen and Piastri are currently on equal points, so Piastri’s distribution is mathematically identical to Verstappen’s. I left it out to keep the chart clear.

# Key Result

The probability Verstappen finishes the season with greater than or equal points than Norris is about 8%.

This isn’t a prediction; driver form, car pace, DNFs, and the usual chaos are not part of this model.","['\\[Edit\\]\n\nThis chart shows the probability distribution given a driver finishes in the top 10.   \nA distribution chart showing all resultant race positions skews both charts to the left, however the probability outcome for P(MV>=LN) remains the same.']",7,1,0.77,7,1,1,7,1,0.77,7
1p5uq5n,How do you rate drivers?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p5uq5n/how_do_you_rate_drivers/,2025-11-24, Discussion,"How do you rate drivers?

In F1 spaces, there's a pretty strong consensus over where each driver relatively ranks. This post was prompted by [this discussion post asking who would be closest Max in the second RBR seat](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p5ftxx/which_driver_from_the_current_grid_would/), where there's a clear favorite answer (Charles) and then some runners-up (George, Fernando, and Lando a few times), which seems to be about the usual ranking.

But like...how do you guys know? I get that different drivers have demonstrated fantastic W2W skill or pace or raw speed, but these things are obviously affected by the car. When comparing drivers who have never been teammates, e.g. Russell vs. Leclerc, in your mind, how do you compensate for machinery? Like, I don't think I could say George *wouldn't* have done even better than Charles in the 2022 Ferrari, or that Charles wouldn't have more race wins than George in the 2025 Mercedes. 

I guess related: where does the consensus in the relative quality of cars come from? This season, with all the VCARB/RBR shenanigans, I've heard that the RBR has a higher ceiling but the VCARB is easier to drive. But based on what we know (everyone not Max has done better in the VCARB than the RBR), it seems equally possible that Verstappen is just car Jesus who  would have won the championship in the VCARB and the RBR without him would be a backmarker—not saying this is true or I believe it, but it doesn't necessarily seem *less* true than the current popular opinion.

I think the boring answer is that fans will naturally reach consensus (especially with new fans coming in and learning about past seasons via memes/stories) and that F1 is fundamentally not a sport where you can compare drivers like that, but I might be/probably am missing something. So how do you compare drivers and cars?","[""Vibes\n\nAnd consider how they're performing compared to their teammates, how consistent they are, and in relation to the team/car's recent performances.\n\nBut mostly vibes."", ""For that discussion post you linked, the reason Leclerc is mentioned is likely more because he and Verstappen like similarly slippery cars + have known each other for a long time so they're often associated together. \n\nIf we're rating based on skill, you'll never find a clear consensus on the 2nd best after Verstappen. There are people on here who 100% believe Leclerc, Russell, Norris, etc. are all bums - when in reality they just don't like them. Sports are inherently biased, that's part of the fun but also frustration when speaking to other fans."", ""The general public have no clue, including myself. There's so many factors that go into each driver's race.\n\nIt's mostly favoritism, vibes, or simple nationality that usually makes people like a driver more than others"", ""This is Reddit, we rate drivers based on whether we like them or not. When drivers that we like do well, we say it's skills. When drivers that we don't like do well, we say it's the car.\n\nI am joking but at the same time I am not lol"", ""it's pure vibes, but most people vibe similarly, especially when they're not die-hard fans of any driver or team\n\nI'd say most people would agree max is, at the moment (and for the past few seasons), the strongest driver on the grid. \n\nOscar and lando were pretty close to eachother at the start of the year but oscar losing confidence as of late and lando REALLY hitting his stride in the last few races"", 'Here on reddit, basis their last race.', 'Alphabetically', ""It's tough, you cant REALLY, definitively and quantitatively really compare drivers.

If you cant really quantify exactly two NFL players, with all their billions of stats, we've no chance to really quantify F1 drivers in different machinery, lol.\n\nBut everyone does it anyway, you just see how someone performs race after race, over a whole season. For a better read though you need a couple seasons. Like Albon I felt was higher up in earlier years, but this seson, even though he's had some great performances, hes made a bunch of silly mistakes and crashed unnecessarily, kinda brings him down a tiny bit.\n I'd say you rate them based on a number of diff variables, hows their qualy, how do they develop over a weekend, how do they compare to their teammate, what do the drivers and team say about the car (easy or difficult to drive, really sharp balance that snaps on you, then you give them more leeway, or like verstappen, if they dominate in that cars is all the more impressive), how they do in qualy, how they deal with pressure, how they bounceback from shitty weekends, etc"", 'There are many factors, here\'s a few that work in Charles\' favour:\n\n1.
