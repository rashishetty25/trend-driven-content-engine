Aside from Silverstone and Austria this year (and Lewis at Spa), cars seem to find it nigh on impossible to overtake, even with DRS zones to help. The Suzuka race in particular was a big example of this. No-one could overtake anyone. Monaco was another example - the Williams drivers slowed by 3 seconds a lap so the other could get a free pit stop, and the dirty air was so bad that even when they were driving 80% speed no-one could slip by (granted, it wasn't helped by the narrow width of the track).

I'm just very surprised the dirty air seems no better than 2020-2021, considering all that I heard about these cars ""improving racing.""

It's far off 2022 though.\n\nThe two main issues at the moment are:\n\n\\- The cars are producing so much downforce from the floors that they can run less RW, so the DRS effect is less.
