1kgt8cf,Yuki Tsunoda is currently in a position where no one can accurately assess did he doing good anymore,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kgt8cf/yuki_tsunoda_is_currently_in_a_position_where_no/,2025-05-07, Discussion,"Yuki Tsunoda is currently in a position where no one can accurately assess whether he is fast or slow anymore.

Yuki began 2025 with excellent pace. In Australia, he steadily maintained P5 and even overtook Ferrari for P4 after the restart, but VCARB's wrong pit stop decision destroyed everything. In China, Yuki continued to maintain good speed and secured P6 in the sprint race, with abundant opportunities to claim P8 in the main race, but once again, VCARB made an incorrect pit stop decision, and then the front wing of his car exploded...

Clearly, Yuki with VCARB raced well and proved himself as the best of the rest, even holding off some cars from the BIG 4. RB also positively evaluated that performance and promoted him to the main team.

Continuing with Red Bull, after 6 consecutive years of struggling with their second driver, they and everyone else understood that their car is undrivable for anyone except Max. Their approach with Yuki has also changed. RB has agreed to let Yuki use a setup that is ""slower but more stable.""

This also leads to some questions: how much slower is this ""slower but more stable"" setup compared to Max's setup in an ideal lap? Can Yuki with this ""slower but more stable"" setup achieve better speed than Yuki with the fastest possible setup? Yuki himself lacks experience with RB's car, so setup issues may continue throughout the season.

Anyway, Yuki's speed was immediately better than Liam's. Yuki made a mistake in Japan quali Q2, but in subsequent races, he consistently made it to Q3. Interestingly, the race where he was closest to Max's pace (Bahrain) was when RB's car completely lacked pace, and even Max had to compete with Alpine and Haas. I've also noticed that Yuki's Q3 qualifying lap times typically don't improve compared to Q2 - perhaps he's playing it safe and avoiding crashes? Maybe Yuki doesn't know how to improve his speed further when he can't adopt Max's driving style? It's very difficult to assess.","['at this point Yuki just exists', 'Yuki has been better than Lawson and miles off the mark from Max. At the end of the day that’s probably what RBR have come to terms with to accept. I reckon he’ll see the season out, because who else could they realistically throw in there at this stage? I don’t think they want to mess with Hadjar’s development.', 'He is significantly slower than Max but faster than Lawson. That’s all you can really say. Probably applies to the majority of the grid', 'I think his biggest Problem is the Performance convergence of the Field. \n\nLets say the slower setup costs the car 2-3 tenths. Combine that with him not always performing perfectly and you run into the realistic problem that you arent fighting with the top dogs, but are firmly in the midfield. \n\nFrom that perspective i think that he performed adequat.', 'He’s been pretty solid on the supposedly challenging to drive RB21. He’s standing his ground. Nuff said.', 'For now getting points is clearing the bar and if he in a couple of races can fight with Ferrari/Kimi for places 5-8 he will be doing good.', ""I remember Yuki saying he used Max's setup for Japan FP1. And got only one tenth slower than Max, in a car he's driving for the first time. His driving style is most similar to Max compared to the other Red Bull drivers. So it's not impossible. But, he also said he hated how unstable that setup is and changed it to something more similar to his VCARB setup. \n\nNow the car is more balanced, but the speed is slow. He's trying to find the sweet spot where the balance is to his liking and the speed is high too. Which is what we get in the Miami GP, i think. After the race he said he pushed the car to the max, but it was still only a very small fraction faster than Isack's VCARB. Hopefully the car gets better with the next update+he gets a better understanding of the car and can push the car more. He did say he tried to push the car to the max in the Q3s but it reacted unexpectedly. I'm positive he'll understand it more with time. \n\nAnyway, Liam didn't do well in the car because his driving style is quite different from Max, and he didn't have enough experience to set it up for his own style. Isack would probably have the same problem, tho I don't know his driving style enough to judge for that part."", 'He will be having upgrades in imola, let’s see how much a difference that makes.', '\\> after 6 consecutiveyears of struggling with their second driver\n\nnot  true for 2021 to  2023 perez was good enough.']",267,197,0.85,267,188,188,232,129,0.13,232

Just to give an example, in qualifying the SF-25 was only 2 tenths better than the problematic SF-23 . Better tyres (softer), better aero after two years of work in the tunnel, good efficiency in terms of top speed and DRS, no sign of porpoising. Yet the car practically never came to life except in Jeddah. A series of performances never in line with expectations while the operation on the tyres remains unknown. The Maranello team had a bad weekend where only the sprint, thanks to the weather that mixed the cards, once again rewarded Hamilton after a desperation move. Leclerc did not even start due to the accident with the intermediates, a questionable move in terms of evaluating the conditions.\n\n\nMcLaren was untouchable, even Verstappen had to destroy his first stint to resist in vain . The Miami heat made the MCL39 more unbeatable than ever. The spectre of a summer domination that would wipe out the competition\'s motivation looms. Everything depends on the drivers\' ability to avoid making mistakes.\n\n\nFerrari\'s potential unusable, the simulator says it exists but the track doesn\'t, here\'s why Vasseur talks about it\n\n\nIt\'s not purely aerodynamic, the car is simply running with mechanical settings that are inefficient for the race, this is compromising the qualifying. For some reason the engineers can\'t get the rear suspension to work as it should. It could be a problem with the anchors or the travel. From what we understand there is a new suspension in the works that could be combined with the latest big package but the timing is unknown.\n\n\nIt is a very delicate and totally unexpected change during the season , not rapid, if nothing else it clearly indicates where the problem is and that it is not strictly aerodynamic in nature. The hope is that the corrections work as they did a year ago , after the technical direction was suddenly vacant due to the departure of Cardile (who will take up a position at Aston Martin next July). At that time Vasseur took the interim but was certainly caught off guard as we entered a delicate phase. This could be a delayed backlash, perhaps the cause of some assessments deemed insufficient on the courageous changes of the 677 project.\n\n\nHowever, Ferrari cannot endure a long season that risks seeing it at times even in fifth place.\n\nCurrently in Maranello there are already two teams, one dedicated 100% to the 678 project in the works . A phase where normally dozens of different designs are tested, some extreme, to establish where the areas of greatest profit are. DT Loic Serra was in Jeddah where things worked less badly, at least for Leclerc, he was not in Miami . On his shoulders the responsibility of a triple and burdensome commitment: thinking of a good car for next year, curing the SF-25\'s illness, implementing (a lot) the quality of the technical choices on the track.\n\n\nEveryone asks the same question and it\'s legitimate: couldn\'t the Ferrari SF-24 have been further refined instead of changing it ""99%""?\n\n\nChanging the aerodynamic balance to focus more on the front end required a completely different overall geometry. Tweaking the gearbox and reducing the overall dimensions of the rear suspension did not pay off . The trap was just around the corner but could not have been foreseen in the simulations that only gave gains without any drawbacks. For better or for worse, the Venturi cars will remain among the most unpredictable and unreadable in the history of F1.\n\n\nAfter the stormy (in every sense) American weekend, it is worth underlining the words of the seven-time world champion reported by the BBC which now perhaps seem clearer: ""I think this car has really good performance. Something is holding us back at the moment, it\'s there, we just can\'t use it .

As for the SF25 it might end up scrapped as it's simply not worth it to invest too much time trying to catch a soon to be 200 point deficit when you have a regulations shift next season.

Whether it is the unwillingness to break out of traditional norms to take risks in exchange for chances of winning or the organisation of the fold crumbling under pressure, changing team principals on a constant basis will not solve the problem at hand, especially since Vasseur was the man who narrowly led Ferrari to the top, had it not been for the middle stretch of the races. There is a case to be made with Binotto, but constantly being in the cycle of  shifting, blaming and replacing would only send the organisation back to square one, and fumbling over themselves\n\nThat being said, I also believe Vasseur needs to iron these issues out if Ferrari wants to salvage the rest of their season. Miscommunication between drivers and engineers are not the most unheard of, but for it to be a recurring theme is insane. Neither Leclerc nor Hamilton had adequate pace to catch Antonelli, and they barely kept Sainz at bay in a car believed to be much weaker than theirs. The issue that the drivers are figuring out the car's strengths and weaknesses, and trying to salvage what they can with its characteristics is concerning at this stage of the season. By changing the car's philosophy *(which I get the reasoning but I wouldn't have particularly been on board with)*, the gamble did not pay off well\n\nWith the race where they can bring upgrades coming in, I hope they find something. If that doesn't work, then I can only hope Vasseur would use the time and his efforts to fix the team.
