1n2eblr,[OC] A visualisation of driver turnover for every team since their last major ownership change,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n2eblr/oc_a_visualisation_of_driver_turnover_for_every/,2025-08-28, Discussion,"Even though this year‚Äôs silly season may be very quiet, I wanted to see the movement of drivers between teams and how true certain stereotypes are (looking at Red Bull and RB changing drivers like they are trading cards). Which team do you think has handled driver changes the best (or worst) in recent years?  


A few quick notes and takeaways:

* The decision for the cutoff point being each team‚Äôs last major ownership change was because (at least in theory) the ownership would have some decision making power and thus the results would represent the most recent team policy. Let me know if you want to see the all-time results but that will probably take a while.
* The common perception that Red Bull has a systematic, ruthless policy of ‚Äúperform immediately or be replaced‚Äù, seems to hold some truth, but much of it stems from their junior team, which is used as the testing ground for executing the strategy.¬†
* It looks like Red Bull, at least for their 2nd driver, follow patterns similar to other teams.
* Alpine‚Äôs 2nd seat looks increasingly unstable recently. Doohan has already been replaced by Colapinto, whose seat is now under pressure.
* 2025 was one of the biggest shuffles in recent history. After a completely static grid in 2024, half the grid in 2025 is drivers in new seats.

1n2g37v,Our personal F1 Fantasy game so far‚Ä¶,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n2g37v/our_personal_f1_fantasy_game_so_far/,2025-08-28, Discussion,"In honor of summer break finally ending! I thought I would share the fantasy league that myself and five friends have been playing, and how it‚Äôs working out so far.

A little back story, there are six of us that work together at a fire station, and we are huge fans of F1, but everyone‚Äôs knowledge of the details varies. I wanted to come up with a fantasy game that gave everyone a good chance of points each weekend. So here it is.

First I made a board along with everyone‚Äôs names attached to some Velcro. In order to determine picking order, each week we race the PS4 game at the designated track. This also helps when watching the race because you feel like you really know the track. None of us are huge gamers so it‚Äôs sort of the great equalizer. Occasionally we have people gone on vacation or we were too busy at work to accomplish practice and qualifying sessions. In those cases we draw names from a hat and do a running pick either via text or FaceTime.

Once quali has determined picking order, everyone gets to choose ONE team and TWO drivers. The number one pick chooses EITHER one team, or one driver. Then the second person goes and so on. Once the 6th person picks their first pick, they pick again, then picking goes in reverse order, and back down again. (Ex: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2‚Ä¶6)

Picking first is obviously a big advantage, but it does not necessarily mean you will have the best combined score for the weekend. Everyone‚Äôs points for the weekend are added up at the end and we get to look forward to the next race on the calendar. 

The game has been a big success. It‚Äôs relatively still close at the summer break. We also added a race on the calendar where you‚Äôll see Andretti on the calendar. This is a karting facility nearby where we physically went together and raced for points. Each weekend you end up cheering for new drivers and teams which keeps it exciting. This format has worked out so much better than I planned, and it‚Äôs really given us a whole new level of enjoyment this season. Hope you enjoy our shenanigans. Glad break is over. Lights out and away we go!

Pictures: the board pre-picks, the board mostly through picking, the total points so far, 4 of the 6 of us in Vegas the first year.","['very cool!
