1i78lvs,"Starting today, we are banning Twitter/X content on r/formula1. We urge all journalists, creators, photographers and other F1 personalities to also make their content available on alternative platforms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i78lvs/starting_today_we_are_banning_twitterx_content_on/,2025-01-22, Meta,"**TL;DR:** For a trial period we will ban all content from Twitter, with the intention to make this ban permanent in some form.

Hey everyone!

After [yesterday’s proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i6lm2v/proposal_to_ban_xcom_links/) we discussed within the mod team whether a full ban on Twitter content would be feasible. We had already been encouraging Bluesky as a source over other platforms, since by not forcing users to log in it is more accessible and it does not suffer from the various other issues affecting Twitter. Our main concern with a full ban is that while many F1 journalists have joined Bluesky, teams, drivers & FOM have not. But we also realize that it’s a *chicken or the egg problem* and as a community of almost 5 million, we probably have a non-trivial effect as to what platform is the native source for F1 news

In the end we’ve settled on the following approach:

* For a trial period we will ban all content from Twitter with the only exception of screenshots of relevant posts by teams, drivers & F1 that are **not available on any other platform**. Even in case of major breaking news, we ask you to post links to the press releases or a screenshot of the post from Instagram, with a link in the comments.
* We hope that this trial period will provide a nudge for F1 journalists, creators and teams to make their content available on alternative platforms as **we intend to make this ban permanent in some form.**

Why a trial period? First of all, sometimes mods make bad decisions even if with the best intentions. (For example in 2015 this subreddit banned images & gifs, which caused a controversy that was only resolved after [Will Buxton stepped in to mediate the situation](https://redd.it/3jmslx).) Second of all, this is one of the strictest approaches to Twitter content and strict bans like this can have unintended consequences, so we might need to later refine this ban. We intend the trial period to last at least until the first races of the new season, after which a final form of the ban would be implemented.

This subreddit has had restrictions on what content can be posted for a very long time. We’ve had the source rating system that labeled the quality of news sites and is still used for removing sensationalist and unoriginal articles. We’ve also had limitations on Instagram due to its requirement for an account to view posts. There’s no doubt that over the past years Twitter has become a low-quality source: the login requirements, the flood of bots, the prioritization of content from paying users and promotion of sensationalist content. But unlike with news sites in our source-rating system, for Twitter there wasn’t really an alternative. But now that viable alternatives are emerging and the proposal thread from yesterday has shown that the community prefers those alternatives, **we think it’s time to try and see how the subreddit works without content from Twitter.**

# For journalists, photographers, creators & other F1 personalities

Our preferred alternative platform is Bluesky and to help avoid impersonations we have created a [list of verified F1 related accounts on Bluesky](https://go.bsky.app/57f6geP). This list is used both for feeds & starter packs on Bluesky, but also for AutoModerator here on Reddit. We are adding new verified accounts whenever we come across them, but please contact us on Bluesky or send a modmail here on Reddit to accelerate this process. We want to assist with this transition and we also want to hear your feedback throughout this trial period, so please get in touch.","['https://preview.redd.it/ffwlldom9jee1.jpeg?width=1289&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e7761f171e9f5d7430bb27593eb3c53408674db\n\nI see F1twt is reacting to this in a so normal way. 😭', ""Twitter was such a low bar for quality news anyway.

Firmly a top 10 driver of all time in my opinion \n\n4 consecutive world titles is an incredible feat, and he had to fight Lewis and prime Alonso to get to them in 2010 and 2012. I also don’t think the car advantage was as massive as people pretend it was, particularly in 2010. I simply think Seb was just the best guy that season. \n\nBy the end of his career, the only guys he had really “lost” to were Ricciardo and Leclerc. You can also say he was bested by Lewis in 2017/18. I don’t see how that’s any worse than someone like Lewis losing to Russell.', ""What's the best F1 podcast?"", 'Still watching 2020 races.

Truly, don't sacrifice your sleep and education to watch something live that you can still watch on replay. I'd guess you're fairly young, and making this kind of no-fun responsibility choice is the unfortunately reality of coming into adulthood.\n\nIf the issue is not being able to see full race replays somewhere, then if f1tv isn't too expensive in your country, it's a great product."", ""Maybe with a change of mindset you could enjoy them delayed? I don't live in too terrible of a place to watch most races live (eastern United States), but still a lot are like 8 or 9 in the morning, and if I happen to be awake, I watch live, but I don't set an alarm on weekends, so it's usually a bit delayed, and it's definitely delayed on the races that start at like 1am my time. \n\nIt kinda feels like some extra tension for me, because I'm so tempted to check race results, but I don't. And, if there's a really long red flag, you can choose to skip through it if you want.\n\nSince you haven't even tried watching a race recorded yet, I think you should try it and see how it feels. I don't personally feel like I miss anything not watching live. I really really think you should do this. Like the other commenter suggested, if you don't have a way to watch replays, try to get one. If you don't have money of your own, ask for it for an early birthday present. Hopefully you live somewhere where it's affordable. Then, you don't have to just watch highlights but can watch the full quali/race. I don't enjoy watching only highlights.\n\nIf for some reason you absolutely cannot watch a race recorded, what have been your sleep schedule so far? Are you just sleeping fewer hours than you were before? Because that's definitely not going to work. If races are on, for example, from 1-3 AM for you, then you need to go to bed like three hours earlier than you used to go to be, and set an alarm for like 12:50, and then go back to sleep after the race. I don't recommend this at all, but it's much better than cutting the number of hours that you sleep.\n\nWithout knowing what country and timezone you live in, I can't give more specific advice."", ""It's the classic case of many newer viewers not being familiar with his peak and took the later results at face value. Otherwise I don't think anyone underrates him."", 'I wouldn’t say Vettel definitely isn’t a top ten driver of all time, but to say he ‘firmly’ is would be a stretch in my opinion. Having watched every season back to 1990, I would say Schumacher, Lewis, Max, Alonso, Senna and Prost were all more complete drivers than him. In order for him to be top ten all time, I have to rate him higher than at least three of Ascari, Fangio, Moss, Clark, Stewart and Lauda and that seems like a stretch. What I will say however is that I think there’s a cut off point where it is really difficult to compare driver ability between eras due to various changes in the sport, and I think that cut off point occurs somewhere around the mid to late 80s.\n\nI will firmly disagree on 2010. Seb hit his team-mate in Turkey, turned a win into a third by flouting the SC rules in Hungary and had a nightmare at Spa. He left a hypothetical 50 points on the table as a result of those errors, which no other contender - not even Alonso during his early-season flurry of uncharacteristic errors - came close to. If you add in the 75 points turned into 12 through mechanical failures in Bahrain, Australia and Korea then you can see the potential was there for that car & driver combination to win the title by 110-120 points. Sure enough, that’s the exact margin they won by the following year. And even if Seb is as great as his most ardent supporter thinks he is, he isn’t beating prime Lewis or Alonso by that margin in equally matched equipment.\n\nI would also argue the four successive titles is overstated. I’m not saying it isn’t a brilliant achievement, what I’m saying is that if you put a top driver into the best car with an inferior team mate for four years, you should expect him to win four successive titles. To me, what determines greatness in that scenario is not that you win, but how you win, and to Seb’s credit I will agree that 2011 and 2013 were absolutely exceptional, and in 2012 his racecraft took a giant leap forward.\n\nOn your point about the car advantage not being as big as it appeared, I would say there were certain instances I’d agree the results don’t really give the full context. For example, the results would tell you the RB7 was an absolutely untouchable rocketship, but in reality McLaren were snipping at its heels at a good number of races that year. They threw away Monaco by two-stopping Jenson, at Spa Jenson could’ve won if it wasn’t for a botched quali and a couple of other races - Spain and Singapore come to mind - were quite close. The car was undoubtedly quite clearly the quickest over the balance of the year, but what made 2011 impressive compared to 2010 was that Seb passed the tests he faced with flying colours and without unforced errors.\n\nI would also contend the years alongside Ricciardo and Leclerc give off a somewhat inaccurate impression that they were fundamentally better than him. In 2014 Seb had to readjust his driving style to accommodate for the loss of the blown diffusers, then in 2019 I feel Seb was still reeling from the mental drubbing Lewis gave him in the back end of the prior year. He made several notable errors but Charles still only beat him by a small margin, so it’s clear on raw ability alone Seb still had the goods.\n\nWith the passing of time it’s clear to me Seb is becoming more and more misunderstood. If you take the results as gospel you’d conclude he was GOATed, but if you take the critics as gospel you’d conclude he was a Newey merchant. The truth is somewhere in the middle.']",12,44,0.77,12,37,37,3,1,0.050000000000000044,3
