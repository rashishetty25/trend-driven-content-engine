Yet people act like he’s merely a top midfield driver, worse than the likes of Leclerc, Sainz, or Norris. But then people like to think Lewis will go on to suddenly be super competitive with supposedly a superior driver to George next year, Leclerc.

I think George is the most underrated driver on the grid right now because people do not like him. Lewis is a top 3 driver of all time at worst, so where does that put George talent wise? 

Sure, people always go about “experimental setups” or “Lewis is just unmotivated”, but, I’m sorry, that’s just a cop-out. Then we can just argue endlessly that basically no driver is worse than another driver, since there could always be intangibles like that, “oh, he just doesn’t care about driving in midfield cars”. really? 


I think George is at least Leclerc level. Leclerc got a lot more credit for beating Vettel in 2019, and Vettel is not close to Lewis in driving skill. So why the discrepancy? I think it’s just that people overlook George because they don’t like him on a personal level","[""I think people notice it, but it's hard put value on it with the merc being so all over the place with its performance.

Good to hear that they are also considering to raise the weight limit to accommodate the cooling system into the adjustments.
