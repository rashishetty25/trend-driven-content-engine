1nipqiw,Resources/cool shit for a kid who is apparently into F1 now,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nipqiw/resourcescool_shit_for_a_kid_who_is_apparently/,2025-09-16, Discussion,"So, my kid who's in junior high has been getting into Formula 1 for the last six or seven months (thanks Netflix!). I enjoy it when it's on, but have never been an aficionado; it's definitely niche in the US, and I think most Americans still associate auto racing with NASCAR which I find objectively boring. 

Anyway, are there any cool documentaries, resources, books, etc that stats/gear obsessed kid could nerd out on? YouTube channel recs, age-appropriate neatness? 

Thanks in advance, fam

Lots of stuff there."", 'We pay for the F1TV package yearly and it’s freaking awesome during the season. Multiple views, even on replays, every race every year, it’s great.', 'In terms of books I could say try Adrian Newey\'s ""How to build a car"", it\'s practically his autobiography, not really technical, and as one of the most important engineers of the last three decades of F1 he\'s an authority, and then follow with Ross Brawn\'s ""Lesson in strategy from Formula One"". The technical books I know are mostly MSc level and not specific to F1 (thinking about Milliken and Milliken\'s or Katz\'s, which are texts suggested in some of my university courses).\n\nThere are other narratives books like biographies which talk about major drivers which could interest him, I would try a Lauda or Senna biography as they\'re among the most liked even today and they\'re two very important figures in the sport.\n\nFor documentaries I\'d suggest series like Racing Through Time, which explores both Formula One and interwar racing ([Playlist 1](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6Qe3ninV3VjI5ru0CoKqfx7cPZPX7SCs&si=X6QVxIYbKlz6OIaO), [Playlist 2](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTOUyQcU3JG3iiSo7FXJueu1Nav603yIC&si=tDwG1_B6QbaC5Oed)), but there are many other well made ones, like 1 (2013) and McLaren (2017).\n\nSince Lauda is my sport hero, I\'ll leave this [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW5qT4HIAd1a2dkXKmLcNtJ0u048nfUY-&si=1UKZxmhTEnTx5olo) here, it has a main interview and other videos with Niki talking about his career and contemporary (to his late life) F1.\n\nAs for fiction, Grand Prix (1966) is a technical spectacle, and Rush (2013) tells the story of one of the most interesting rivalries in F1.\n\nHave a look at [this](Racing/Motorsport https://boxd.it/1jmT6) Letterboxd playlist which has more than a thousand racing movies and documentaries.\n\nIn terms of stats there are several sites, although I contribute to Wikipedia and I find it to be the most diverse and complete.\n\nI have a [YouTube channel myself](https://youtube.com/@luca_salerno?si=q1xPXkYWWt55GEfM), but I\'ve uploaded only one video about the 1925 championship, so not really F1, it\'s more niche as an argument.
