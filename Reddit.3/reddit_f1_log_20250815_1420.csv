1mq3rkk,What caused the shift in the front wings and aero of 2004 to 2005 cars?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mq3rkk/what_caused_the_shift_in_the_front_wings_and_aero/,2025-08-14, Discussion,,"['Technical regulations were changed to slow the cars down.

About a month ago I shared an interview with Prof. Malcolm Smith, the inventor of the inerter, and many here watched and discussed it. But that video wasn't intended for the casual viewer and the response made one thing clear: even among engineers and F1 fans, there‚Äôs a lot of confusion about what an inerter actually does.

Tha fact is: the inerter is deceptively simple but very easy to misunderstand. This has always been the case. After all, it became famous because Renault‚Äôs engineers misunderstood it.

So I made a follow-up video to clarify things (hopefully) once and for all.

Given how tricky this topic is, I decided to explain the inerter at three different levels:  
‚Ä¢ An ‚Äúexplain it like I‚Äôm five‚Äù analogy  
‚Ä¢ An F1-fan-friendly version with no engineering background required  
‚Ä¢ And finally, the proper engineering explanation

Along the way, I address some of the most common misconceptions and even a strange conspiracy theory. I‚Äôve also included a few extra interview clips with Prof. Smith that didn‚Äôt make it into the first video.

I‚Äôll try to reply in the thread if you have further questions.
