1guz22f,Why is George beating or matching Lewis for 2 seasons out of 3 so overlooked?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1guz22f/why_is_george_beating_or_matching_lewis_for_2/,2024-11-19, Discussion,"Seriously, unless we agree that Lewis is basically nowhere near his prime level, then why is Russell not getting any credit for what he’s doing.

Yet people act like he’s merely a top midfield driver, worse than the likes of Leclerc, Sainz, or Norris. But then people like to think Lewis will go on to suddenly be super competitive with supposedly a superior driver to George next year, Leclerc.

I think George is the most underrated driver on the grid right now because people do not like him. Lewis is a top 3 driver of all time at worst, so where does that put George talent wise? 

Sure, people always go about “experimental setups” or “Lewis is just unmotivated”, but, I’m sorry, that’s just a cop-out. Then we can just argue endlessly that basically no driver is worse than another driver, since there could always be intangibles like that, “oh, he just doesn’t care about driving in midfield cars”. really? 


I think George is at least Leclerc level. Leclerc got a lot more credit for beating Vettel in 2019, and Vettel is not close to Lewis in driving skill. So why the discrepancy? I think it’s just that people overlook George because they don’t like him on a personal level","[""I think people notice it, but it's hard put value on it with the merc being so all over the place with its performance. It's hard to compare when we have no real baseline when it comes to the car."", 'personally i’m curious to see how george and lewis do next year to grasp where they actually are because this merc is a very confusing car.

They’re 2 points apart this year and last year Lewis ended third, while George ended up in 8th place.', 'It’s hard to actually value the performances seeing as both drivers and team are so hit and miss. \n\nOver the 3 years though George has done a great job and I’d be surprised if Redbull don’t ask for him in a swap should Merc sign Max', 'The only people who genuinely think Russell is ""only a top midfielder"" are the type of \'fans\' who are far too comfortable in spouting their ignorance in general about the sport. He\'s clearly comfortably in the Leclerc & Norris (and potentially Piastri in the future) bracket, and those who try and argue otherwise are just trying to fuel a narrative that fits whatever agenda they have.\n\nThat said, you\'re also making some statements in there regarding Lewis & Vettel that really don\'t make you look too much better.', 'George is in a quagmire. If he never beat Lewis at all, they’d say he’s the second coming of kovalainen and a burn out. If he beat Lewis three out of three seasons, it’s because Lewis is “past his prime” and “not all there anymore”. \n\nIn reality, he’s acquainted himself well under the toughest of circumstances, going up against the veritable goat in struggling cars. He’s taken it right to Lewis from the start and came out on top in 2022. Lewis crushed him in 23, but they’ve both made the best where possible of this year’s car. For all intents and purposes, this pairing is exactly what we expected to be but without the championship contending cars we expected to be underneath them.\n\nNow that Lewis is leaving, George has a narrow window to really stake his claim to the throne before the Antonelli tidal wave becomes overwhelming. He has to crush Kimi utterly and make him look like he never deserved to be here in the first place.']",3102,1248,0.82,3102,15288,15288,34,8,0.0,34

The cars are hopelessly out of step with the characteristics of F1 cars and the discrepancies in car performance that exist due to a lack of testing and availability of spare parts will never be solved because that would require them actually putting their hand in their own pocket.', 'That is why Super Formula is seen as a finishing school. It has more downforce, power steering(F2 does not. Professional drivers(meaning you have guys in the series for a few years and know the thing inside out), and you need to learn new circuits so it also does not aid the F2 graduates.', 'Pretty sure Yuki was never even given any FP session before his call up.', ""The thing is that junior Formula series used to scale pretty decently. Every move up the ladder means a car that is faster, brakes harder, has more downforce and experiences more G-forces. The tech increases every step and so does complexity, but in the end setup works largely the same. Pretty clear cut.\n\nHowever, nowadays driving an F1 car is way more than just driving as hard as you can. Many of the younger drivers will quite easily be quick over a few laps in an F1 car. To do good in an F1 race tough, that's where the scaling between F1 and junior categories falls on its ass.\n\nMedia and social media pressure is immense, but that has, at least in some part, always been the case for the sport so I'm going to leave that out if it. What is incredibly different is that an F1 driver nowadays has to be able to read a car a lot better and a lot more than they used to.\n\nTake braking. Before the introduction of hybrid elements a driver could basically only modify their brake balance in the car. Nowadays it's brake balance, brake migration (the shifting of brake balance depending on the brake phase), the amount of energy harvesting / '(hybrid) engine braking' etc. Those settings don't exist in any of the other cars and can greatly mess with a drivers ability to be on the absolute limit (Ricciardo's McLaren comments for example).\n\nThan there's conservation of energy and tires. So much of F1 nowadays is centred around keeping the tires alive long enough without them falling off the infamous cliff and making sure you don't use too much fuel. In essence, the car does not carry enough fuel to go a full race distance on full-send mode, so they need to conserve that energy. For most (junior) drivers this is a rather foreign concept as during the junior races they can easily just fill the car up and go all-out for the full distance. Being able to feel the car, being right on the edge of what the tires can do and what fits your fuel target is something incredibly finicky and not all drivers are great at doing so. Combine that with either having to attack or defend for position on track and you've got a complex task that they aren't taught from an early age.\n\nDrivers like De Vries are great examples. He's shown that he's a fast driver in plenty of categories, but he lacks the skill-set a driver needs to perform in F1."", 'The major issue with the Junior Formulas is the lack of spaces and opportunity on the top category.\n\n\nYou have old and washed drivers holding on spots on mid-and-back field and some even on top teams...

Seems stupid, Piastri being better at that race is not automatically Norris error?', ""He lost 3-4 points in China sprint, 6 points in Spain, 7 points in Hungary, 15 points in Spa, at least 3 in COTA, and around 7 points in Brazil.\n\nLet's not forget him overshooting his mark in the final pit I Silverstone, it cost him time and fall just behind Hamilton. That could've been a win despite Mclaren choosing the wrong tyre.\n\nAlthough these mistakes can be trimmed out, he's pretty fast and that's something you cannot be taught."", 'While this is definitely a bit extreme and 92 points are unreasonable by swapping Norris and Piastri all the time. Between clear mistakes by Lando or McLaren, there is quite an easy argument of 50 or so points lost. That would put the gap at only 12 with three races to go, and the fight would absolutely be on until the end.', ""This is why the narrative that Max's 50-something points lead he had going into Miami was always impossible to claw back has always been so strange to me. He made that in 5 races, one of which was a DNF. What was stopping Lando from recouping those points in 19 races? \n\nAt the start of that run, he needed 3 points over Max per weekend to win the championship, and in that time that he's had a faster car than Max in all but a couple of races, that number has ballooned to >20. \n\nThe reason most media are letting this go is that they never expected much from Lando to begin with. Vettel was crucified for the rest of his Ferrari career for how he performed in 2018, and the same would happen if any other generational driver of this century had such a poor year."", 'I think the most realistic take is simply that McLaren & Norris could indeed have won this year, but it was pretty unrealistic for anyone to expect them to actually do it.\n\nMcLaren haven’t been in the fight for a championship in a long time, and Norris hadn’t even won a race before this year. Could they have done better - undoubtedly, yes. They will be disappointed. But in all honesty, this year should ultimately be seen as a big step forward. \n\nThe real questions will have to be asked of them next year.

However, his mid-season dip cost him a chance at an outright fight for the Drivers' Championship."", 'Quite a few of these should be attributed to McLaren rather than Norris himself.

Sudden fall of RB and then rise of McLaren was kinda unexpected and it took some time for team to respond to it. I mean, this season we had very fluctuating grid order, it could also be one off for them. For some time Leclerc was one considered as title contender until their awful run in few races.\n\nSo Lando had to change his mindset basically mid season and normally driver in team that started like mclaren would try to gain and celebrate his first, maybe lucky win.
