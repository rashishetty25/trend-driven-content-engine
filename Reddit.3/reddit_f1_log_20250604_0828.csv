The reason: How much revolutionary their brakes are. Tire conservation and the capability of keeping them on the right temperature window will still be key and this is not changing with the new regs. 

We have seen that when the temps are cooler they don’t dominate as much, but in so many circuits the temps are hard to control and they do it so much better than the rest. If other teams don’t find out how to replicate that technology, it’s going to take a much, much faster car to offset that advantage. 

I get that 2009 double-diffuser feeling, but in this case, much harder to copy. 

Thoughts? ","[""People will eventually figure out how McLaren's handling the brakes, and will get it copied sufficiently.
