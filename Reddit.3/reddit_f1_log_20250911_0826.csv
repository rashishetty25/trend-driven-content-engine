**Fernando Alonso:** I remember once South Korea in 2010. It was a red flag in the middle of the race. It was very wet, aquaplaning everywhere. We stopped on the grid and it was Mark Webber first. I was second. I came to the, um, to the grid and I spoke with him. You know, the track is really bad. You know, his aquaplaning, it will be a disaster if we restart the race now. And I knew that the race was about to restart soon. He(Webber) said that I entered in his mind that the track was worse than what actually it was. And and he crashed after the restart.

Anyone have the link to the full video? \n\nAlonso-train for 2026 starting early!\n\nFrom an article posted an hour ago! \n\n**Formula 1 News: Newey believes his new car ‘will be the best’ – Alonso**\n\n>In comments leaked from a sponsor interview with Maaden and distributed by Spanish outlets, two-time champion Alonso described Newey – who is leading Aston’s 2026 design – as “the best designer in the history of the sport.”\n\n>“Newey makes me feel very safe,” said the 44-year-old.\n\n>“Probably no one will ever match his numbers. His way of working explains some of the results he’s achieved.\n\n>“He has an incredible way of seeing the car as a single piece that works together, not as individual devices that provide performance,” the Spaniard continued. “He’s able to anticipate the entire car as if it were a single piece. He seems to have everything under control at all times.\n\n>“He has a self-confidence I’ve probably never seen before. He’s not worried about other teams, other philosophies, or other designs. He believes his will be the best.”\n\n>Alonso said Aston Martin’s recent struggles were turned around by leadership moves such as Newey’s signing. “Arrivals like Newey have allowed us to reset our expectations and our motivation,” he said.\n\n>“If you don’t see any change when the situation isn’t good, then it becomes a problem. Then you lose confidence. But I think what I’ve found at Aston Martin is a team and a leadership that will never be happy until we win.”\n\n>Alonso recalled Newey’s visit to Monaco earlier this year. “He doesn’t talk to many people, but at the same time he’s always thinking and tinkering with things. The front wing here, the suspension there – I think he’s more of an artist than an engineer.”\n\n>Finally, the 32-time grand prix winner said he and Newey share a similar mindset. “When we’re motivated, we become obsessed,” he smiled.\n\nInterview basically confirms that Newey has been tinkering with the 2025 car, as a side-quest.  Like we didn't know.... with how drastically the car has went from back of the grid to now."", ""Always liked the line about Spa 2011, like\n\n> you can only race that hard with someone you trust\n\nNot to make this controversial in comparing it with now, but I always liked about say Alonso, Button, Webber etc. - you could tell they very genuinely knew this guy won't bonk you off intentionally, and they have the skill to manage wild maneuvers and really *dance*. Little things, like Monza 2010, Alonso saying he knew he needed to win on strategy because Button doesn't make errors, or waving off Canada 2011 because it's not Button's style to whack people, and he has a lot of benefit of the doubt.\n\nAs some observed at the time, it's perhaps informative about the relative pace of the cars that Alonso's fought Webber way more than Vettel."", 'Webber never recovered from Korea 2010,it was a before and after moment that you can look back.\n\nAll the remaining years he still raced he was a shell of the driver he once was.', ""Fernando: Bet you can't do a flip in the car"", 'So he does remember things before the 2015 testing crash.

1ndq57a,F1 can learn some lessons from WEC,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ndq57a/f1_can_learn_some_lessons_from_wec/,2025-09-10, Discussion,"
I recently dove into the world of WEC and watched several races from this season. I’m very impressed with how well it’s run, especially in terms of safety and the consistency of decision-making from the Race Director.

Full Course Yellow (FCY):
Instead of bunching the field behind a Safety Car, every driver slows to a controlled speed of 80 kph while maintaining their position. The pit lane is closed. This eliminates the need for a VSC and adhering to a delta time. It effectively freezes the race and prevents anyone from taking advantage of gaps under the VSC.

Virtual Safety Car (VSC):
This works the same as a Full Course Yellow, except the pit lane remains open. Again, instead of monitoring a delta, cars are held to 80 kph throughout the VSC. This ensures no one gains an advantage by manipulating the delta.

Safety Car with Wave-By Procedures:
This is an area F1 could easily adopt. While you could argue F1 already has a similar system, WEC’s implementation is far more consistent. Each phase of the Safety Car is predictable and standardized, which provides better forecasting for teams to make strategic decisions.

Overall, the procedural decisions made during WEC races appear far more consistent than anything I’ve seen in F1 over the past 12 years. ","['As someone who follows both series closely I think WEC’s current procedures work very well for them and F1’s procedures work well for F1. There’s no need to change anything', 'I feel like F1 cars would struggle being stuck on 80 kp/h and the tire temps would drop massively, a delta time gives them more room to manage it.', ""WEC's procedures work well for WEC because WEC cars are fundamentally far more balanced vehicles that can still operate fairly well at 80kph and at the restart.\n\nIf F1 cars slow down to a speed of 80kph for a few laps, on most circuits and on most tire compounds, they'll be too cold for the restart.\n\nCourse volunteers can also work around 80kph WEC cars. The F1 cars need to be bunched up together under safety so that course volunteers can be safely dispatched to do their job. It is one thing to work around 80kph cars - another thing altogether to be out there with cold F1 rubber and aerodynamic grip reliant cars."", ""You haven't made a single argument for why F1 should adopt these changes or what would actually be improved by doing so.\n\n\nIt's different, it allows for different strategies. Different can be better, but it's not necessarily better."", 'One of these has 60+ cars that race for 24hrs and regularly pass each other the entire time.... The other does not', 'I loved at COTA this past weekend when the safety car had done so many laps in the wet that they had to switch it out for another but then didn’t tell the field so they followed it into the pits and in the confusion temporarily mixed up the field so bad they had to red flag the race to determine the correct starting order.\n\nIt made for an interesting in-person viewing experience.\n\nOk the whole, WEC’s procedures are good for them because their races are long and the cars are well balanced to each other (another 10kg for Toyota).', 'WEC races are long lol. Lemans has had 12 hours of safety car procedure before. You could eat a whole f1 race with 1 sc procedure lmao. Both series are regulated by the same FIA. F1s regulations work for f1, WEC for WEC.

But then he was booted out of the team in favour of Charles Leclerc, and we never heard from him again. What happened to him?

Maybe it was because like you said, Ocon was immediately nearly on pace with Pascal, even though Pascal received preseason testing and 12 races before Esteban got there."", 'Like some people have said, at Sauber Ericsson was favoured due to a majority of the team being owned by swedish sponsors, which put pressure on him being made priority by the team. He still beat Ericsson if I remember right, but not by enough a margin to make a name for himself. It was the same thing with Nasr in 2016, you can assume that it was the same inner scenario with Charles in 2018, but Leclerc intubated Ericsson anyways.\n\nAlso, as someone else pointed out, Wehrlein had a bad relationship with his team, and that always creates a stain thats hard to wash. I dont think he changed much either, last I heard he was also having some petty spats with his teammate in Formula E.', 'Hype is a fickle thing.
