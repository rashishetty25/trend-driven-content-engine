I was confused that over the winter in here that there was a bit of a narrative forming that because he had a poor end to the year (which is quite overstated) that he wasnt a championship tier driver and wouldnt get close to Lando.\xa0\n\nLike the same people were saying after the 7 race stretch from Austria to Baku where he was the best driver on the grid bar Max, that he would be champion this year and would beat Lando in the championship in 2024.\xa0\n\nHe’s only starting his third year of F1 and is improving at an alarming rate. In 2023 he was criticised for his struggles at tyre management. Since mid 2024 he hasn’t had a problem with it. Over the winter he was criticised for his Quali pace, but people need to realise that Lando is one of the best qualifiers on the grid.\xa0\nHe’s literally outqualified every team mate he’s ever had including peak 2019 Sainz in his rookie year.\xa0\n\nAnd the tracks Oscar beat Lando at last season were the same ones he had driven in F3 and F2, Monaco, Monza, Spa, Baku, Hungary.\xa0\n\nWhen he is as familiar with every track (and it’s already happening if we compare his pace in the first two races of 2025 relative to last year) he will be scary.\xa0', '“Since mid 2024 hasn’t had problem with tyres”.

Since mid 2024 he hasn’t had a problem with it.\n\nThere were still severaal races, especially in the back half of 2024, where his race pace was really lacking comapred to Lando. One of the main reasons for this was his lack of tyre management.\n\n>He’s literally outqualified every team mate he’s ever had including peak 2019 Sainz in his rookie year. \n\nThere is no indication that 2019 was Sainz\' ""peak"". He\'s just gotten to his best form from 2023 onwards imo if you compare him to Leclerc, who has also improved.', 'Nowhere in the initial comment OP mentions about people in either of the 2 categories. \n\nNo idea how you came to the above conclusion.', 'Ok interesting points. Ones I disagree with but interesting all the same\n\nWhich races did he struggle at tyre management in the back half of 2024? You see while theres a correlation between struggling with tyres and lack of pace I don’t think it’s a causation.\n\nOf the races in the back end of last year where he wasnt close to Lando there were other reasons than tyre management. And some he was really close to Lando in.\xa0\n\nUSA - Only around 5 seconds of Lando\xa0\n\nMexico - recovering from qualifying P16\xa0\n\nBrazil -\xa0\xa012 seconds off Lando who is better in the wet (one of Piastri’s few weak areas) before 5 second penalty.\xa0\n\nLas Vegas - Only around 5 seconds off Lando\xa0\n\nQatar - Beat Lando\xa0\n\nAbu Dhabi - Got taken out on lap 1\xa0\n\nSo he wasn’t really particularly struggling on tyres in these races.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nAnd now for Sainz’s 2019 season. In my opinion it is the best season put together by a midfield driver in the last decade. For context in 2019 the top three teams were way ahead of the rest and the best result you could realistically hope for was P7, or P6 of second Red Bull was struggling\xa0\n\nBahrain - Amazing start and is 6th, then he tries to overtake Max for 5th but they touch and Carlos loses his front wing and retires due to crash damage. But that shouldn’t take away from the fact that he was fighting Max Verstappen for fifth in a worse car.\n\nAzerbaijan - finishes P7 after a string race in the points. Second best in midfield behind Baku specialist Perez.\xa0\n\nSpain - finishes 8th after pulling some opportunistic overtakes on Kvyat and Grosjean towards the end.\xa0\n\nMonaco - Goes from 9th on the grid to 6th (best of the rest and joint best result for McLaren in the last year) with a really strong first stint and he makes one of the most unbelievable, underrated double overtakes around the outside of turn 3 on both Toro Rossos on the opening lap.\xa0\n\nFrance - Qualifies seventh gets to sixth at the start and doesn’t relinquish it. P6 and best of the rest again.\n\nAustria - Goes from last row of the grid after grid penalties to 8th place in a great comeback race.\xa0\xa0\n\nBritain - Has a great start to gain two places. Gets into sixth with safety car luck and proceeds to make a great defence of that position against a faster Ricciardo for the last portion of the race. P6 again.\xa0\n\nGermany - Finishes P5 in wet, wild, wonderful race. Had Stroll and Lvya not got lucky with their pit stop gamble when running out of the points them Sainz would have been 3rd!\nMcLarens joint best result of last half a decade.\xa0\n\nHungary - Finishes P5 AGAIN! Holds off a faster Gasly for over 35 laps! Over half the race Carlos held off a Red Bull and he won that battle!\xa0\n\nItaly - was running up in SIXTH place until McLaren left his wheel loose after pit stop.\n\nRussia - Qualifes fifth and has a great start to get ahead of Bottas for fourth. Bottas repasses him before the faster Red Bulls come through ahead. However Vettel retires so Sainz ends up getting 6th place. Again.\n\nJapan - He gets another P5 after another strong Quali, another strong start and finishes 48 SECONDS AHEAD OF THE NEXT BEST MIDFIELD CAR. That is insane.\xa0\n\nMexico - Goes from 7th to 4th at the start before having to do a two stop because of silly Q2 tyre rule where top ten have to qualify on the tyres they started on. This means he is 13th rather than likely 6th.\xa0\n\nBrazil - The best performance of his career. Imo it even beats his magical wins in Singapore, Australia and Mexico.\xa0\nCarlos Sainz goes from 20th and plum last on the grid, to 3RD! In what was perhaps not even one of the top 5 best cars on the grid that day. Yes the top cars made a lot of errors but Sainz had to overtake everyone else on track. Amazing race to get a thoroughly deserved first ever podium.\xa0\n\nAbu Dhabi - Makes two incredible last gasp divebomb overtakes on the Renaults to clinch the point he needed to get him 6th in the drivers championship by one point.\xa0\n\nI think other than Lewis and Max, he was the best driver on the grid that year and it is the best season of his career. He was the best of the rest in almost a third of the races that year with four P6 finishes, three P5 finishes, and a magical podium in Brazil.\xa0\n\nHe came sixth in the championship ahead of two drivers who had spent half their seasons in a Red Bull car far better than Sainz’s.\xa0\n\nHe was over 40 points ahead of the next midfield driver.\xa0\n\n\nI don’t think 2023 and 2024 compare at all. In 2023 Sainz had strong form in Italy and Singapore but they were his first podiums of the season.\xa0\nLeclerc had an insane amount of bad luck and still beat Sainz in the standings.\xa0\n\nAnd mainly, when Ferrari were in a fight for 2nd in the Constructors at the end of the year decided to be absolutely nowhere. In Vegas he spun at the start and worst of all, in Abu Dhabi he gets knocked out in Q1 and eventually retires one lap from the end while running in I think 15th. Meanwhile Leclerc had two of the best races of his career as he tried to get Ferrari 2nd place.\xa0\n\nIn 2024 Sainz had a great start to the year and on his day was great, but he made loads of mistakes that cost Ferrari the championship.\xa0\n\nIn Canada he spun off while running on the edge of the points and took Albon with him. In Singapore he crahsed in qualifying and this ruined not just his, but Leclerc’s lap too at a track they could’ve got a good result at. And In Brazil he crahsed out of both qualifying and the race.\xa0\n\n2019 was peak Sainz.\n\nAmd Ive just spent over an hour writing a Reddit comment hardly anyone will ever read…', 'First time on Reddit?', 'I was being facetious', 'TLDR.

You also eliminate the driving on the grass/mud practice, and potential issues from things like water bottle leaks.

So, are there things the teams would do to ""cheat"" if the weigh-in process changed? Especially cheats that would render the whole process useless?

/edit: This is not about any one team, car or driver. More on the the pros/cons of the weigh in timing. I'm not defending or attacking anyone in particular.

/edit2: Lots of examples of dumping liquids or changing parts. Those things would be really obvious and subsequent rules would surely make them much more difficult. The current weighing rules are already very complicated where different things are weighed separately and so forth. Assume that the obvious loopholes would be covered.","[""The point is to make sure the car was legal throughout the race, weighing it before doesn't tell you that.

The best way to do it is after the race, that way you're 100% sure you are weighing the exact car that actually finished the race\n\nif teams wish to not be disqualified they could easily add a small weight margin, but they obviously don't want to, so they risk getting DSQed and making fools of themselves"", 'Water at the start of the race can easily be dumped throughout the race to drop weight.', 'This is just how you end up with bags of rice in the bushes.', 'If you weight at the beginning the teams will find ways to reduce weight during the race.\n\nLike adding water and make it leake (e.g. the drink), add and burn unnecessary fuel and oil and many more ways.', 'Everyone dumping a 60kg dumbbell on the start line seems dangerous.']",0,57,0.27,0,432,432,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
