1gqigpv,What will the cars be like in 2025/2026 based on the regulations?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gqigpv/what_will_the_cars_be_like_in_20252026_based_on/,2024-11-13, Technical,"Newbie fan here, so apologies for my ignorance of the subject!

I keep hearing about 2026 being the year in which new regulations will apply, and this appears to mean fundamentally redesigned cars? 

My question is: Given that, this year, it‚Äôs been quite competitive between a few teams in terms of car performance, will next year‚Äôs 2025 season be likely to be similar? That is, if next year‚Äôs regulations are similar, then presumably the teams (focussing on 2026), will be applying moderate improvements to the existing cars for 2025, rather than entirely new designs?

Additionally, does anyone know yet how different the cars might have to be under the new, upcoming regulations?

I‚Äôm curious because I‚Äôve found the last few months really exciting with all the different teams/drivers that have been able to win and I‚Äôd like that to continue!","['2025 will likely carry on being super close - unless one team would decide to do the opposite and instead sacrifice 2026 a bit to go for a better car this year. However they wouldn‚Äôt necessarily even succeed these cars are so tricky to develop. So in all likelihood 2025 will look similar to this year. However 2026 will have so many changes to Aero and Power units that there‚Äôs a good chance one team will get it way better than the rest and lead the way. However we really have no idea what 2026 will look like.', 'Big change for 2026 is moveabe aerodynamics, both the front and rear wings will be able to move between 2 modes for top speed and grip.\n\nMuch more power coming from the electrical energy with a 50/50 split between fuel and battery power.\n\nCars slightly smaller, 8 inches shorter, 4 inches narrower, 30kg lighter.\n\nRear wings will have traditional endplates rather than the current curved single profile.\n\n30% less downforce and 55% less drag. \n\nMove away from ground effect to over body aero.\n\nAs regards 2025, as you get to a mature set of regulations things usually close up as teams converge on the best solutions and the rule of diminishing returns means there is less time to be found.\n\nSo expect it to be even closer than this season with potentially more teams joining the battle at the front.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FyFerbm6Js&pp=ygUHZjEgMjAyNg%3D%3D', 'Same but different', "">presumably the teams (focussing on 2026), will be applying moderate improvements to the existing cars for 2025, rather than entirely new designs?\n\nNo, you can expect each team to design a completely new car for next year. There are certain changes that the teams cannot apply to an existing car, such as the cooling layout and homologated parts like impact structures, so it's better to start from a clean sheet. \n\nAlso, teams can only start working on the 2026 car from the 1st of January onward, so they don't have to compromise on either year's car. You will however see certain teams stop bringing upgrades early on to focus on their 2026 design."", 'Slower', 'Quite terrible, it would suggest', 'Can‚Äôt wait till that first race/quali in 2026 :)']",0,12,0.42,0,8,8,0,1,-0.010000000000000009,0

Alpine and RB are considering dropping Lawson and Doohan in favor of him. Carlos Sainz is on his way to Williams and we know he's a fantastic veteran driver.

Williams seemed to have found gold with Colapinto and they're willing to let someone else have him? Is Williams not interested in a talented rookie, apparently lots of sponsorship money, and a huge fanbase?

For reference I like Alex Albon and he deserves a seat in F1. However, isn't F1 a cutthroat sport?
