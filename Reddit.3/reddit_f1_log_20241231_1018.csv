Who do you think performed better between these two over the season?\n\nSimilarly, in 2003, the championship came down to Raikkonen vs Schumacher. Which driver performed better?\n\n2006 was a titanic battle between Schumacher and Alonso. One of my fave seasons. Same question: who do you think performed best between these two?', 'Is Monaco the hardest circuit?', 'Is there any yt vid that explains the differential, brake bias etc...?', 'Is there no alternative to a generator that would allow cars to recover energy through the front wheels? This way, energy could still be recovered without an increase in weight.', ""That depends on how you define hard. Yes, it's the most difficult in that it's very narrow -- but you could also make the case that Jeddah is the hardest circuit because there are so many blind high-speed corners. Likewise you could argue that Singapore is the hardest circuit because the humidity means that it takes a physical toll on the drivers."", 'If you want to recover energy, you need some kind of generator to do it.\n\nThe nearest generator on a current generation F1 car is attached to the PU behind the driver, meaning running a driveshaft from the front wheels to that is massively impractical. This means the only practical solution to add front axle energy regeneration is to add a separate generator.', ""Not really, because there's not a lot connecting the front wheels to the rest of the car -- just the suspension and the braking system. The point of the MGU-K is that it harvests energy from the engine under braking, not the brakes themselves. When you press the accelerator, the engine spins up and the car moves forward. When you press the brake, the calipers squeeze the rotors, creating the friction that slows the car down. But when you press the brake, the engine is still spinning and burning fuel, so that system is inefficient. All the energy that would normally go to the drivetrain and then to the front wheels is being wasted because the brakes are slowing the car down. The MGU-K captures that otherwise-lost energy and stores it in a battery, then the ECU regulates when that battery power is put into the powertrain, allowing the car to operate more efficiently. So as much as the energy is being harvested under braking, it's not actually being harvested from the brakes. And since there is no energy being sent to the front wheels -- either from the engine or from the ECU -- there is nothing to harvest there."", "" I tried driving through the monaco circuit on F1 22. I would lose my front wing in a lap or two. I spent 2 hrs in this circuit but never lapped anywhere below 1:20.

What do you think guys?

  
I think there's still a chance he will win 8th championship since Ferrari car is better than Mercedes's. If we compare to Max Verstappen, Lewis doesn't have a good chance.","['Let me check my crystal ball brb', ""I honestly think he could, if Hamilton is motivated, meshes with Ferrari (and more specifically Adami) well, and has the car to do it, it's definitely not impossible for him to beat Leclerc over a season.\n\nBut it would probably be one of his toughest teammate battles ever.\n\nConsidering he isn't in his prime, and Leclerc is, it would be much more like a Nico win in 2016.\n\nBut this last season I don't think is anything to compare his current ability to, he almost came in P2 in the 2023 driver's championship while George came in P8, and RedBull had a rocketship then.\n\nThat Mercedes has been a dog since 2022, McLaren obliterated them in the constructors with the same engine, that means Mercedes doesn't have a clue how to build a car with the current regulations, whereas Ferrari has built a solid car each season of these regs.\n\n2026 is so different it's genuinely impossible to know what team will be at the front, so no point guessing about that yet.\n\nBut Leclerc is incredibly talented, other than Alonso, he'll be the best teammate Lewis will have ever gone up against in the same car, making this one of his most difficult achievements if he were to pull it off. \n\nGeorge showed that he was a very capable teammate, especially in quali, but I still feel Hamilton can handle himself in a race, especially over a full season.\n\nBut I will say I have a genuine feeling losing Bono as his engineer may be his achilles heel. \n\nThere were so many times Bono pulled Lewis back from the brink of despair, which he'd often sink into during poor performances and Bono would ease his frustrations and was capable of bringing the best out of him so he'd end up with the most points he could get even when a race went sideways. \n\nI'm curious how Hamilton will adapt with Adami in his ear instead of an engineer he's had for the past 12 years, a friend he could trust more than anyone in his career, someone he won 6 championships with.\n\nThat's a massive change, probably even more so than driving a Ferrari for the first time."", 'I hope so. But only to put to rest such questions. Though I think what would happen is just ""will Hamilton continue winning his 9th and 10th"".\n\nHamilton is already one of the most accomplished drivers in modern F1 history - one more or less WDC would not diminish his stature an iota.\n\nDoes it feel like history has been made to have a triumph over such a legend a la the 2021 Season with Max Verstappen? Definitely. Does it mean Hamilton is a lesser driver now with something to prove? Not at all.\n\nWhen he retires, it\'ll really be a generation\'s passing of the torch & loads of us will miss his fantastic drives, overtakes and on-track battles', ""Ignore that he was 7th, that doesn't matter at all. What does matter though, is that he lost to his teammate. The teammate is the only real comparison for a driver, since the car quality determines the rest of the positions. Max wouldn't be winning WDCs in a Williams.\n\nI don't think Lewis will beat Charles next year, so I don't think that he will win his 8th WDC no matter how good the Ferrari is.

It's going to take time for him to adjust to working with Ferrari -- there are new people and processes involved and relationships to build -- so I think the idea that he'll step into the Ferrari and instantly return to the Hamilton of old is a bit of magical thinking. That's not to say that he doesn't have the talent to win and eighth title; I just think there's an ever-diminishing window of time in which he can do it.
