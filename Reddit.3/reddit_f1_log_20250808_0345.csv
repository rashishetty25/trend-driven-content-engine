It shouldn\'t happen that an upgrade can mess everything up like that. With all the smart people on the team, all the simulations, and the infrastructure we have, you don\'t expect a car architecture to confuse you like that. We tried to solve one problem, and it made something else significantly worse. That\'s now been fixed.""*', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **As soon as the old rear axle was returned, Mercedes drivers regained confidence in their cars. The new rear axle will likely never be seen again.**\n\n> This result sounds familiar. At the Miami GP, McLaren celebrated a one-two finish. George Russell took third place on the podium. Back then, he was 33 seconds behind the winners. This time, it was only 22 seconds. Between those two races, there were eight races and three upgrades. Or one win and six disappointments.\n\n> At Imola, Mercedes aimed to solve a long-standing problem with its first major development step. A new rear axle with more anti-lift was intended to keep the rear of the car more stable during load changes, within the window where aerodynamics work best. But the debut turned out to be a failure. The drivers complained about an unstable rear end, which promptly led to increased tire wear.\n\n> In the subsequent races, the Mercedes engineers tried to find the problem, sometimes relying on the old rear suspension, sometimes on the new one. In retrospect, it must be considered unfortunate that the new rear axle was in the car for the victory in Montreal. It wasn\'t the new rear axle that led to the brilliant moment, but rather the special track layout.\n\n> **The unsuspecting front wing.**\nAfter Mercedes drifted into the midfield at Spielberg, Silverstone, and Spa, the engineers decided on the most radical solution possible: back to the starting grid. In Budapest, the old rear axle was back in service with a few new details that had been introduced in the meantime, but weren\'t suspicious.\n\n> Take the front wing, for example. Chief engineer Andrew Shovlin explains why the front wing was ruled out as the cause of the problems, despite its reduced flexibility. ""The data shows that the stiffness of the wing has an impact on the car\'s handling and balance, but not as dramatically as the drivers felt. We were able to correct this with the setup and, at most, we\'ve experienced a bit more understeer.""\n\n> George Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli had barely completed their first laps at the Hungaroring when they thought they were driving a different car. ""The rear end is stable again when turning,"" Russell praised. His young teammate rejoiced: ""The confidence in the car is back.""\n\n> **Progress through regression.**\nTeam principal Toto Wolff summarized: ""We\'ve given our drivers a more stable platform. Their increased confidence has been reflected in their lap times."" Russell missed pole position by 0.053 seconds. Antonelli completed 50 laps on one set of tires, defending his tenth place.\n\n> But Wolff also had some critical words: ""We rebuilt the car to its pre-Imola state and made it better. It shouldn\'t happen that an upgrade can mess everything up like that. With all the smart people on the team, all the simulations, and the infrastructure we have, you don\'t expect a car architecture to confuse you like that. We tried to solve one problem, and it made something else significantly worse. That\'s now been fixed.""\n\n> Anti-lift suspensions aren\'t a bad idea per se, but for Mercedes, the concept didn\'t deliver the desired result because too many compromises were required to install them. ""It wasn\'t planned for us. Retrofitting is never ideal in such cases. If this type of suspension works better for Ferrari or McLaren, it\'s perhaps because they weren\'t as restricted in their installation as we were,"" Shovlin laments.\n\n> **Is Mercedes still celebrating victories?**\nAfter the result at the Hungarian GP, the Mercedes drivers are looking more positively toward the ten races following the summer break. ""It\'s not just the World Championship point that feels good after so many disappointments,"" Antonelli said with a sigh of relief. ""As long as I was able to drive in clean air, my speed was good. I now know that I can fight for points in every race again.""\n\n> Russell nevertheless cautions drivers to keep their feet on the ground and not assume that Mercedes will finish on the podium every time from now on. ""Apart from the McLarens, there were a lot of surprises in Hungary. The Astons were better than expected, and Max was further back. But in terms of speed, with the exception of Canada, it was our best Grand Prix in a long time. And that was on a track type that doesn\'t suit us that well. We can now look ahead to the remaining races with a little more confidence.""\n\n> At a time when Mercedes has regained a solid starting position, it\'s almost frustrating that everyone in the field has stopped their arms race. ""We don\'t have any major upgrades planned, but we can still make small adjustments and optimize the car\'s setup,"" Wolff hopes. At certain racetracks, this could even make the W16 a contender for victory again.

McLaren have been dominant with little chance of anyone else getting involved in the fight. However, 2025 offers some interesting new teammate pairings. The mathematical model seeks to eliminate the factor car by only measuring drivers against their teammates.","[""In defense of the model, it makes itself quite clear that the lack of data for rookies makes it quite hard to give them or their teammates a fair score. And in a season with 6 rookies, that's bound to be a problem."", ""A note with regards to data visualization, don't use smoothed lines for line graphs. Instead use straight connections or stepped connections.  \nSmoothed lines introduce implied datapoints that aren't actually in the data. In your graphs you can particularly see that in the peaks and valleys that happen in-between races.\n\nHere's an example using the Lawson graph with some rough vertical gridlines added. \nhttps://imgur.com/a/bQ6b8SR\nThe second image is an attempt to show how the straight line graph would look.\nIn-between race 11 and 12 the rating drops, but because the smoothed graph has to smooth out the curve, there is an actual peak in-between those two races that implies the actual rating is higher than it is. Inversely, the rating stays approximately the same in-between race 12 and 13, but the graph has a significant drop in-between those two races.\n\nThe lack of vertical gridlines amplify that issue because you can't exactly tell where the individual measurements are, so viewers won't see that the peaks and valleys aren't actual data.\nWith a straight line plot you don't need to have vertical gridlines as the changes in the line show where the data points are, but with smoothed lines you absolutely need them.\n\nOn another note, as you have a scale that goes from 0 to 100, set the y-axis range to 0 to 100. \nThat way you show the data with regards to the full range.\nLawson's graph is another good example for this because he seems to have hit a rating of 10 for races 3 and 4, so the graph implies that he has hit the lowest possible rating.\nAnd because of the smoothed lines it actually looks like the graph goes below 10, making it look like his rating goes into the negative and gets clipped."", 'LOL at the meltdowns', 'I clicked on the link first, thought ""this list is pretty decent when you consider the factors, maybe I\'d change one or two things"" then clicked into this thread and was shocked to see the vitriol lol.\n\nIsn\'t it obvious a mathematical model will become more accurate the more data it gets? The bottom half of the ranking is weird, but the top half seems fine. Sure, I\'d probably bump Russell ahead of Albon, but it\'s not like it put Albon at number one or anything truly ridiculous. \n\nA few questions:\n\n1. Have you ever considered doing this for IndyCar? Drivers there have very long tenures, so it might be cool to see how the model rates them over time. I understand if you aren\'t interested in the series though.\n2. What would Leclerc need to do to beat one of Verstappen\'s last five seasons? Would he need to beat his teammates as decisively as Verstappen?\n3. Why does the model project Piastri to improve so much? How do we know he isn\'t near his ceiling? \n\nThanks for the time you put into this. Even if it\'s not 100% reflective of RL, it\'s fun to see how the stats are interpreted by the model.', ""Sees Albon ranked 3rd, I don't know what you guys are talking about, this model is clearly perfect!"", 'Holy this list is awful, Borteleto and Hadjar below Franco is crazy, Piastri 5th and Norris 6th is hilarious, agree that Albon has been top 5 or close though', ""why are people so mad at this? I don't get it really."", ""Nice work as always, sorry for all the angry and unfair comments you're getting.\n\nI think one area the methodology could improve is the time it assumes it takes for a driver to reach their ceiling. From what I've seen, a driver reaches their peak pace in their second or third season (based on teammate pace comparisons etc) , and after that it is just about maximising it. Piastri for example I don't think is going to get any quicker, you refer to a pace gap between himself and Norris which quite frankly does not exist this season. So I think he's already capable of performing at his ceiling.\n\nThe other area (but not too sure if there's a fix) is that I think it's easier for someone to be 'consistent' (according to the model) when they have a less competitive teammate or have a car that's in no mans land, because then you aren't punished for mistakes or a lack of pace. E.g Lewis was sometimes qualifying like half a second behind Charles at the start of the year, but since Ferrari were the clear fourth fastest car, he would finish quite close to Charles anyway. Meanwhile in Hungary, he 'only' qualified two and half tenths behind Charles, but since the field was much more competitive he was out in Q2 while Charles proceeded to put it on pole. The model has the latter as the much worse weekend, which makes sense and again not sure how you correct for that.\n\nSimilarly with Verstappen, he's botched quite a few qualifying laps this year but I assume he was not punished for them given he still beat his teammate comprehensively. I don't think it's a coincidence that he's been by far the most consistent driver according to the model since 2019 given that's where Red Bulls second driver issue started, but yeah difficult to incorporate that into your methodology."", ""I'm just here to support you because you're going to get a bunch of hateful comments just for trying something different.\n\n\nI agree that one of the main issues with models like this one is that the model clearly assigns most of the weight to the car and then gets the deviations for each driver. This is a proper way of modelling, but it may not be as accurate. Having said that, in F1 the data is limited and models will always be limited by the amount of data that you can provide to them. You're not doing an experiment, but working with observational data, which is way harder to analyze (much harder than most people will ever understand).\xa0\n\n\nKeep it up.\xa0"", 'a very nice season from Leclerc !']",225,483,0.77,225,2920,2920,13,4,0.010000000000000009,13

A turning point was Liberty Media taking over and making it much, much easier to watch F1, so by that point I very rarely missed a race.

1mkbvk7,What are your thoughts on having multiple consecutive races on a single track?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mkbvk7/what_are_your_thoughts_on_having_multiple/,2025-08-07, Discussion,"With the F1 calendar getting increasingly packed with street circuits and Middle Eastern races, I‚Äôve been wondering, wouldn‚Äôt it be better to have consecutive race weekends at iconic circuits like Silverstone, Spa, Suzuka, Monza, or Albert Park?

Think of it like a ‚Äúdouble-header‚Äù at tracks that consistently deliver great racing. 
Some pros in my opinion-

1. Iconic tracks like Spa or Silverstone are fan favorites for a reason. They usually deliver more overtaking, higher speeds, and more thrilling action than many street circuits.


2. Teams and drivers could benefit from reduced travel stress, allowing more time for rest and recovery.


3. Running two races at the same track could encourage teams to experiment with car setups, tyre choices, and strategies, especially if the weather changes between weekends.


4. If the FIA is truly pushing for sustainability, keeping races in the same region (or at the same venue) for multiple weeks cuts down massively on carbon emissions from freight and travel.


5. Tracks evolve between weekends, rubber builds up, conditions change. so the second race might play out very differently despite being at the same circuit.



Some cons are obviously from revenue and fans perspective -

Repeating venues may hurt the global expansion of F1‚Äôs fanbase.

Local fan demand might not justify two full weekends.


But personally, I‚Äôd rather see two weekends of epic racing at Spa than a single procession at a soulless street circuit.
","['>I‚Äôd rather see two weekends of epic racing at Spa than a single procession at a soulless street circuit.\n\nYou were watching the race at Spa this year, right? Everyone complained how boring it was. Likewise Suzuka.', 'Those ""iconic"" tracks dont guarantee ""iconic"" races. You can race 10 times and get 9 boring races. Nostalgia makes it so you only remember the good stuff. \n\nLook at suzuka this year. Spa in dry hasn\'t been good either the last years, same with Imola and Monza.
