It's that time of the year again! The 2024 season has come to a close. What seemed to start as the Verstappening 2.0 quickly turned out into one of the most exciting seasons in recent history [^don't ^mention ~~^^the~~ ^^~~war~~ ^^^2021](https://i.makeagif.com/media/5-09-2015/uuA5Pk.gif) 

Dominating wins, exciting midfield battles and epic comeback drives. First wins, first points and final races. Chaos, fun, emotion and drama. Stars bursting onto the scene and ungraceful exits. This season truly had it all. 

2025 has all the ingredients for an even more thrilling season. We have the most stable set of regulations and tons of great things to look forward to. Can Max Verstappen make it five in a row? Will 2025 be the year Lando Norris does manage to beat him? Can Lewis Hamilton or Charles Leclerc throw a spanner in the works, or will Ferrari turn into a 2007 McLaren? Will Alpine present another 100-race plan? How will Hulkenberg and Ocon fare at their new teams? How good is Alex Albon exactly now that he has a really fast team mate in Carlos Sainz? Which rookies will impress and which ones will disappoint? Can Red Bull make it through the year without another scandal? Will Stroll crash less than 5 times? Long story short: Plenty of things to look forward to in 2025

But before we roll into 2025, we have a bunch of holidays to celebrate. Christmas, Hannukah, Kwanzaa, whatever you may celebrate, or even if you don't celebrate, make the most of these days. Spend them with your friends, family and loved ones. Enjoy delicious food, have fun and play some games. Have a great time and make memories that will last a lifetime!

So on behalf of the r/Formula1 team:
