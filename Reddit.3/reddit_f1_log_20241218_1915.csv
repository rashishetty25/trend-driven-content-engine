The moment Montezemolo broke that agreement, the team went downhill. You could see the same negative dynamics play out at Alpine or at McLaren during the power struggle between Dennis, Whitmarsh and Ojjeh."", '>The case of Prost, a driver that has multiple championships, being fired because he called the car tractor or whatever will forever form my opinion of the team.\xa0\n\n\nTo add to that, his quote about the car handling like a truck was massively taken out of context after a post-race interview and Ferrari never sought any clarification. He\'s explained why in interviews and more recently in his documentary that aired earlier this month.\xa0\n\n\nAll he meant was how his car, in one particular race (Japan 1991), was almost impossible to drive because he had damage. At turn 1 he made contact with another car and his steering buckled as a result, making the car feel heavy and very hard to turn, hence the truck comparison. Now the whole year the Ferrari already had an issue where the steering would lock in long turns and the car almost couldn\'t turn, so the steering damage in Japan must\'ve amplified the issue and felt like hell. Prost called that race one of the best he\'s ever had despite finishing P4 and 25 seconds off the podium. For the record Brundle finished P5 and got lapped, the other Ferrari\'s engine blew up on the opening lap. At the time he was also in the middle of contract negotiations for the upcoming season and Ferrari felt his comments were even more disrespectful given the situation.\xa0\n\n\nYou\'re right that Ferrari has always had an issue with accepting criticism, especially from their own drivers. Another anecdote mentioned in the Prost documentary, in 1990 (which he called of his favorite seasons in F1 in terms of team atmosphere) he brought up to Ferrari how the engine was not good enough to compete with McLaren\'s engine and the team wouldn\'t accept such criticism. He said ""at Ferrari, the engine is sacred. You don\'t touch the engine, you don\'t talk about the engine. Everything has to be about the rest of the car. Except the chassis was very good that year.""

I figure it is the kind of info which is probably casually dropped in the middle of a YouTube video, but I wouldn't know how to search for it by itself.

For context, the reason I want to know is that the Ambulance Trust I work for loves to describe our approach to resuscitation as a ""Pit Stop"" approach, where everyone has a single role and they all come together to work as a team, but I would quite like to be able to point out the next time just how often Pit Crews get to practice working as a team, compared to the one afternoon every 18 months that my trust thinks is sufficient dedicated training time.","['At the factory the teams tend to short sessions with around a dozen stops twice a day. |  \nAt the track they will do a 30 min session every day each 30 min session would be around 50 stops.\n\nRed Bull article about this: [https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en/bulls-guide-to-pit-stops](https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en/bulls-guide-to-pit-stops)', 'Idk but Talking Bulls podcast had an episode with members of their pit crew, can probably find out there', ""Some of this information is second or third hand from some personal sources, and some of it is a few seasons old, so bear that in mind. The article u/Mysterious_Research2 also has some interesting tidbits about Red Bull's approach.\n\nThe actual training structure and volume varies a lot between teams, I think the differences in approach between a top team like Red Bull and a much smaller team like Haas would surprise a lot of people.\n\nYou can break the training/practice down into three separate blocks:\n\n1. Off-season (December - Feb/March). The crew are working almost exclusively from the factory, and the top teams will be training their pit crews for maybe 1 hour per day. Not all of that is pitstop practice, so some days may see dozens of pit stops while others might involve some strength training at the gym. For the smaller teams it will be more workload dependent, and also dependent on their facilities (not all teams have a Red Bull-style dedicated pit stop practice room). There may be weeks where the crew needs to spend time on other things and only have time to practice for 30 minutes on 1 or 2 days in a week.\n\n\n2. In-season at the Track (Wednesday-Sunday). Similar between the teams. Each team will spend 15-30 mins per day practicing pit stops. Due to travel and the time it takes to set up the paddock, there is usually no practice on a Monday or Tuesday of the race week.\n\n\n3. In-season Off Weeks. Depending on travel schedules, fatigue and rest days, the crew might not spend much time practicing back at the factory between races (the number of days in the factory will be team-dependent). At the top teams the training might be similar to off-season when the crew are back in the factory, since they have more support that lets them take time away from their normal duties. On the other hand, some top teams will offer their crew more rest days between events as a perk, so the practice volume might be very small. For the smaller teams, who don't have as many staff and so rely more on the trackside staff to fill in when they're back, it will be heavily dependent on their workload. A busy week might mean they don't train at all."", ""During peak race season I'd venture to say they're practicing daily - for hours a day."", ""On race weekends, they usually practice on Thursdays and Fridays. During off weeks they'll have practice sessions at the factory.\n\nTheir practice hours per year probably reach 3 digits easily."", 'Speed with Guy Martin did an F1 special that let him get a shot at being an F1 mechanic, including the pit stops. It was a really interesting episode an worth a watch, but they do keep some of it secret', ""They definitely don't practice daily during the season as they may not have time with all the time spent traveling and performing other tasks. Regarding the off-season, Vasseur mentioned two years ago that the crew had done about 1800 practice stops over the winter. No idea if it's average, lower or higher compared to other teams though"", ""My company had a guy come speak at a national conference who was head of a NASCAR pit crew for a long time and he showed a bunch of videos of them working out, doing practice runs etc. \n\nWhat was interesting is that when he got into it in the early 90s, apparently they didn't practice at all and just were winging it at that point with whoever they had around. \n\nThis guy was a college football player who got hurt and didn't make it to the league and somehow stumbled into pit crews. He basically convinced the team to let him run the program and train the guys and told them they should focus on finding former college athletes like him, football players, wrestlers etc.  who weren't going to go pro but still wanted to compete in something and were already strong and in shape. Apparently it revolutionized the whole thing, they have an entire training program they bring people into now."", 'apparently some teams like williams have also taken to automating the pit stop practice. previously teams would use an old car that they would push into a set up pit box but i think at somepoint early in the hybrid era that changed.\n\nnot all teams put a lot of emphasis of practicing it and it shows in the pit times.

Why did Ferrari sign him for 96?\n\nIt seems most people at the time felt there were better options for the Ferrari drive, but I have not been able to find any in-depth analysis on why Ferrari chose him. Was it simply that he was the best driver willing to sign a contract to be #2 to Schumacher? I feel like I have read/heard somewhere that Ferrari wanted to keep Berger but that he didn‚Äôt want to be Schumi‚Äôs team-mate.\n\nThe likes of Hakkinen, Barrichello, Frentzen and Coulthard all seemed to have better reputations than Irvine but I wonder if Ferrari looked at Eddie and saw a strong personality who wouldn‚Äôt be mentally fazed by Schumacher‚Äôs presence, and would instead just get on with the job as best as he could. \n\n2. How do we rate him overall? \n\nI ask this mainly in the context of his comparison to Barrichello. After a messy ‚Äò94, Irvine was very closely matched with Barrichello in ‚Äò95 and he seemed to mentally destabilise Barrichello a bit, or at least that is the general consensus and one that seems to be corroborated by Eddie Jordan himself.\n\nHowever, Barrichello went on to be a much better #2 to Schumacher than Eddie was. I said in my recent post on 1992-2003 that there seemed to be two versions of Eddie at Ferrari - one was a great competitive spirit that could take points away from Michael‚Äôs rivals and the other was miles off the pace. \n\nHowever, he started off at Ferrari with a car that was not particularly good and reportedly had very little opportunity to test in his first year or so at Maranello. How much do we think that skewed things against him? It seems to me he improved throughout his time at Ferrari and largely fulfilled his potential in ‚Äò99, albeit the main factor in putting him on the verge of a title was the numerous mistakes and mechanical failures for Hakkinen & McLaren that year.', ""Hey guys, I'm not sure, but I think Red Bull and Sergio may have agreed to part ways. If only someone could post a link or a tweet or maybe even a screenshot?"", 'There was a relatively good interview (or bunch of quotes mashed together into one) with Steiner, where he said the sticking point with Perez may be the lost future income.

1hh6y2i,Why would Lawson be the choice to replace Perez at Red Bull?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hh6y2i/why_would_lawson_be_the_choice_to_replace_perez/,2024-12-18, Discussion,"I‚Äôve seen convoluted versions of why Lawson would replace Perez but have never really understood on what it is based. 

What I want to understand is why would it be Lawson over Yuki (considering the stats comparison, and overall experience in F1)?

Max will leave at some point and they think Liam has a better chance of filling in than Yuki does\n\nPlus all the data we can‚Äôt see from simulator work over the years etc. they will have a good amount of data comparing the two and the trajectories of each driver.\xa0', ""One thing that speaks in Lawson's favor is his great adaptability. He has performed great in both DTM and Super Formula and has also immediately performed well during his two short F1 stints. Being immediately quick in any racing series is usually seen as a sign of great talent. So maybe Red Bull just sees more potential in Lawson and teams in general seem to have come to the conclusion that good drivers don't necessarily need years of development in midfield/backmarker teams."", 'Yukis mouth makes him a problem for team and sponsors', 'Between him and Yuki it is clear choice for Liam. Yuki is average or above average racing driver at best, 4 years in F1, before he was not superstar in F2 alongside Mick, Robert and Ilott.

To sum up: Yuki is not progressing, Liam might.', ""Because they've been closely matched despite Lawson's glaring lack of experience.\n\nAverage qualifying (including sprints) position: TSU 12.00, LAW 12.23\n\nSQ1/Q1 eliminations: TSU 3, LAW 2\n\nSQ3/Q3 appearances: TSU 4, LAW 4\n\nPoints: TSU 8, LAW 6\n\nThe best argument for Lawson is Tsunoda himself, who was hopeless in his rookie year but has slowly developed into a solid driver. If Lawson follows the same curve he'll be even better."", 'I have a suspicion its not as opinionated as people or the media has made it out to be.\n\nLawson is a Red Bull Academy driver. I believe Carlos would have been a viable alternative based on this argument, but at the time of negotiations (which is semi confirmed did happen) he overestimated his bargaining power and wanted terms which Red Bull could not give.\n\nYuki is not a Red Bull Academy driver. Not promoting from within their own ranks where they had control over development would at this point in time put too much doubt in the validity of future talent that sign up and ultimately create significant risk on long term performance stability.\n\nHadjar is next in line in term of readiness so that is why he will be Yuki‚Äôs partner at Torro Rosso next year.\n\nI do agree the other points brought up is probably also circumstantial to the decision, but not the one that drove the replacement discussion. Yuki outdrove both Daniel and Liam this year. \n\nIt was probably their only opportunity to realign with their principles.', 'Because Lawson and Hadjar are both rookies. They need at least one experienced lead driver in VCARB. Yuki is a victim of his own experience.\n\n(edit - typo)', ""Good at super formula. Good at jumping into F1 without experience.

Super fast delivery but unfortunately the actual part came floating inside the frame. 

Looks like a double side tape was used to keep it in place which didn‚Äôt work as expected. 

See image below. ( the white patch in image is some tape at the place where the piece should have been)

What should be my course of action? Is this considered defective, can the frame be opened to place it in place or sadly I should file a return.


Was really looking forward to having a piece of Lewis/mercedes f1 history.

Note: it‚Äôs not in new acrylic box. It‚Äôs inside old style frame that seems to sealed from all side.
