Just two weeks later, Wendlinger had this bone chilling crash where his car t-boned the wall after Nouvelle chicane. Three weeks in a coma.

The death rate drop had dropped significantly (the 70s and early 80s were ridiculous), but these events brought home the reality that there was a lot of luck involved as well.\n\nIf having regular fatal accidents in front of large international TV audiences was unacceptable, then something big needed to happen,  and the whole outlook on safety needed to be more systematic. I remember it dawning on me how poor the run-off areas were everywhere, and that if you think more logically about the speeds cars were traveling vs the run-offs, the barriers cars were hitting, and the ways in which cars deform, there was a lot of work to do. There still is, as risk can never be brought to zero.', 'Pedro Lamy had a testing accident before Barcelona that shattered his pelvis and broke both his legs as well.', ""Wasn't it Alboreto who was incensed that the pitlane speed limit wasn't slow enough -- something like 120 or more -- that he drove even slower, at what eventually became the current speed limit?"", 'As long as you drive anything to the limit, there will be a risk of a freak accident.
