Despite all the well-deserved criticism the F1TV app gets, I love watching old race recaps. The archive is a real treasure trove of long-forgotten F1 moments. I started with the 1989 season and, after many, many hours of watching, I’ve just begun the 2010 season.

There’s something so charming about those old recaps. They’re like a mini race documentary series. They featured insights about the circuit, weekend events so far, interviews, commentary on current rumors, the starting grid, and sometimes even more. They also provide important historical context.

Today’s race recaps, by comparison, feel so dull and cheaply made with the spliced up OG commentary. It genuinely hurts. Especially thinking ahead a few years, rewatching a season will give you just the race, instead of a holistic view of everything happening at the time: the drama, the fashion, the old tech, and so on.

Anybody else feel the same?","['I\'m wondering: Is it because we get SO MUCH information during the broadcast already, what is there to add in the post-race? \n\nMy family are new to F1, and the kids have been watching some world broadcasts out of curiosity, and we\'re like, ""What\'s going on?

1jj06c5,Debut Down Under: Liam Lawson's First Drive | Behind the Charge,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jj06c5/debut_down_under_liam_lawsons_first_drive_behind/,2025-03-24, Video,"In 2023: Liam Lawson says his dad was never able to take him to Singapore GP so he will be taking him to the race instead

""My dad actually used to promise me every year that he would take me to the Singapore Grand Prix, and in the end, we never went, but he's going to be coming to the Grand Prix this weekend, so actually I'm taking him!""

https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/liam-lawsons-rocky-road-to-f1-my-parents-sold-their-house-so-i-could-keep-racing/10658101/

But to get there in the first place, Lawson revealed his parents made a huge sacrifice. ""My parents and my whole family really gave a lot, especially in the early years through go-karts,"" Lawson told Red Bull's Talking Bull podcast. *""My parents sold their house so that I could keep racing. It's massive. They gave absolutely everything for me to be able to race, even just go-karts because it's so expensive.""*

Like McLaren's Oscar Piastri, who lived in boarding school in the UK as a teenager while trying to forge a racing career, Lawson's perseverance was severely tested while 11,000 miles from home. But that early sacrifice often proves a formative experience for the Australian and Kiwi drivers that do make it across and provides them with the steel and grit to survive in F1's often difficult environment.

""I didn't finish high school or anything,"" Lawson shared. ""Honestly, I was just excited to be able to go and chase my dream. And there are always hard parts about it, but there was never a question of whether it was too difficult and I wanted to go home.""

But while he showed promise by finishing second in his first season in Europe, Lawson didn't get picked up by an F1 junior academy right away, and he headed back home to New Zealand's famed Toyota Winter Series without a plan after that, and with his F1 dream on the verge of already being shattered at the age of 17.

""Being from New Zealand, trying to get the money to compete overseas is really, really hard,"" Lawson recalled. ""So, between a group of amazing people that have been behind me, sponsors and investors, we set up the structure to get enough money to go to Europe and do a season and try and get recognised by a junior team, because without it, there was no chance to get a Formula 1.

""I had a good season, but I didn't have any call-ups from any teams. And then I just did this championship in New Zealand's over the off-season, with no plan of what I was doing in 2019.""As a kid being into Formula 1, I would watch this series every single year and I dreamed of driving it. And to me, it was like the Formula 1 of racing at the time.""

Fortunately for Lawson, talent scouts were watching the opening round of the 2019 Toyota Racing Series. And not just any scout, but Red Bull's Helmut Marko, who was keeping tabs on Lawson's older team-mate Lucas Auer, who was part of the Red Bull junior programme at the time.

And even before he would go on to beat Auer, and fellow Kiwi Marcus Armstrong to the title, Lawson would get the news he dreamed of for so long.

""I guess Helmut was watching because of Lucas and I had a really good first weekend,"" he said. ""When I raced in F4 in Europe, Jack Doohan was a Red Bull junior at the time and we tested together somewhere. I remember seeing him walking around in his Red Bull suit and I remember thinking how cool it would be to be a Red Bull junior.

""And I got the call-up after that first weekend in New Zealand, I found out one or two days after the weekend. I was sitting in a cafe - I remember exactly where I was sitting. I got told and it was obviously pretty emotional. I basically got picked up at the perfect time and it saved my career. I had those four weeks left of that championship, and then I had no plan after that...""

Lawson then plied his trade in FIA F3 and F2, going head-to-head with Piastri, dovetailing his single-seater activities with a Red Bull-backed stint aboard a Ferrari GT3 car in the German DTM sportscar championship, that yielded him a runner-up spot.

Finishing third in the 2022 F2 championship landed him a Red Bull reserve role alongside a Japanese Super Formula campaign for 2023, and when Ricciardo broke his wrist in Dutch Grand Prix practice Lawson got the nod to deputise for the Australian for the next five rounds.

In typical Red Bull fashion, it was sink or swim for Lawson, but he kept his head cool and scored points in the extremely challenging Singapore Grand Prix.

Lawson's cameo performances complicated matters for Red Bull in the short term, with Yuki Tsunoda and Ricciardo still getting the nod over Lawson to start the 2024 season while Lawson returned to a reserve role.

But what Red Bull was really looking for in a driver for the renamed RB team is someone who could be a future Red Bull driver. And with it becoming clear Ricciardo isn't ticking all those boxes any more, it has handed Lawson the opportunity to battle Tsunoda for a Red Bull berth.

Following his family's sacrifice to give him a fighting chance, and Red Bull noticing him just when he was approaching a dead-end street, claiming a Red Bull seat would be the third miracle on Lawson's rocky road to the top.

She's under a bit of pressure to represent her gender well, and there's an opportunity to open some doors to other competent women if she does, so I'm watching her career with no small interest

My first impressions are quite positive.  She's fit in seamlessly at Haas.  She managed a very good result working with Ocon at China after Haas was nowhere at Melbourne.  She's got a great authoritative, calming approach on mics so far and her driver clearly likes working with her.  

Ocon has a reputation for being a bit peppery on the mics when things aren't going well, we haven't seen him get to that state yet at Haas but it'll be interesting to see if Laura can keep Esteban focused and get him out of that rut if he falls into it.

1jjcr23,New Netflix show suggestion,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jjcr23/new_netflix_show_suggestion/,2025-03-25, Discussion,"# The Problem:

With the support of the FIA, I think there should be a new show to complement *Drive to Survive*.

I don’t mind *Drive to Survive*, but it has become more of a drama series than an in-depth coverage of the sport. While it’s great for bringing in new fans, it has also led to a wave of social media discourse from people who don’t fully understand the complexities of F1.

Formula 1 is an incredibly intricate sport, with countless elements that make it fascinating—car design, engines, racecraft, team strategies, and so much more. Yet, a lot of new fans miss these aspects, leading to takes like this one from the past few days:

>

This kind of misunderstanding happens all the time, and it’s frustrating because these are fundamental parts of the sport that have existed for decades.

# The Idea:

A new show that dives into the technical and strategic side of F1—covering the rules, mechanics, racecraft, and innovations that define the sport.

Each episode could focus on a different aspect:

* **Engines** – The different suppliers, why some teams build their own while others rely on manufacturers, how engines are managed across a season, cooling systems, and FIA regulations.
* **Car Regulations & Innovation** – How teams design their cars within the rules, how they push boundaries, and the technical loopholes they exploit.
* **Racecraft & Strategy** – The tactical decisions made during a race, pit stop strategies, driver-team communications, and how they impact performance.
* **Behind the Scenes** – A day in the life of a pit crew member, engineers, and mechanics, showcasing their roles and contributions.

With engaging visuals, expert commentary, and perhaps even actors or F1-loving celebrities acting as the audience, asking the questions casual fans might have, this show could bridge the gap between hardcore fans and newcomers.

Would you watch something like this?","['A lot of this is available on F1TV', 'Most of this is already done on F1TV - they have tons of content explaining the more technical aspects, strategy and history of the sport', '> Car Regulations & Innovation – How teams design their cars within the rules, how they push boundaries, and the technical loopholes they exploit.\n\nI hardly think you\'ll get an indepth insider giving you the scoop on how they exploit loop holes!\n\n""hey Binotto, can you give us the scoop on fuel flow limits""\n\n""Sure!

1jj1bnm,Lawson's speed compared to Tsunoda,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jj1bnm/lawsons_speed_compared_to_tsunoda/,2025-03-24, Statistics,"As yet another driver is struggling in the second Red Bull seat, narratives seem to be running wild that take some liberties with the nuances of formula 1. Particularly the ""Tsunoda beat Lawson at Racing Bulls"" narrative.


USA sprint - Lawson 0,029s faster  
USA - Lawson 0,456s faster  
Mexico - Tsunoda 0,033s faster  
Brazil sprint - Lawson 0,545s faster  
Brazil - Tsunoda 0,373s faster  
Las Vegas - Tsunoda 1,438s faster  
Qatar sprint - Lawson 0,017s faster  
Qatar - Tsunoda 0,047s faster  
Abu Dhabi - Tsunoda 0,053s faster

That means that although Tsunoda beat Lawson in qualifying last year, he was on average only 0,099s faster. Translate that to this year's Australian Grand Prix, and that difference still results in p19. Translate that to China, and you're still only looking at p18 in sprint/p19 in gp instead of p20.


Now don't get me wrong, the point of this post isn't to say Yuki Tsunoda didn't deserve that second Red Bull seat, or that he wouldn't have done (slightly) better. I think there's good reason to believe Yuki's experience could have made a difference. However, let's make that point based on good arguments and wipe bad arguments off the table; bad arguments such as ""Tsunoda beat Lawson at Racing Bulls"".","[""This implies that performance stays the same regardless of car or environment, which it doesn't. Sometimes a different car can unlock a drivers potential. The elite drivers will always maximize the car, but the not so elite drivers will find different results and at times not do good with a different car, both Lawson and Tsunoda are in the second group. They might do exactly the same but you never know until you see it, and Lawson is doing so bad rn that there's not many arguments against trying the car with Tsunoda."", ""I don't think you can simply take their results from a different car and apply them to the current car, even though we're still in the same broad regulations. Also, comparing this time difference between the two of them also presents it's own issues because no two circuits are exactly the same.\n\nYou'd have better luck if you compared their results as a percentage, in my opinion (though, it still doesn't present an apples to apples comparison)."", 'The only logical way to resolve this is promote tsunoda but keep Lawson and compare them both in the red bull while demoting max to racing bulls and see if he can lap the entire field in it.', ""Clearly the RB is not a good litmus test, it's too different to the Red Bull. It's about finding someone who likes similar things to what Max likes. Daniel was right there."", ""I don't think it's super relevant, as long as the numbers are close. Lawson in the second Red Bull seat could end his career if he doesn't improve dramatically. Red Bull is essentially done with Tsunoda. If the Red Bull seat destroys drivers, let it destroy a driver that they don't need next year. If they're investing in Lawson, they need him to survive the season and he is probably better equipped to do that in the junior team. Let the junior team do its job and develop the less experienced driver. Let Yuki rise or fall on his own merits. The Lawson question is answered: He can't drive the Red Bull to any satisfactory result. Now answer the Tsunoda question."", 'none of this matters. no one is going to succeed in the second car at red bull this season. it’s toxic.', ""Speed doesn't matter, in Checos case even experience doesn't really matter. Its just a matter of finding a driver who can drive the car that RedBull tailored towards Max Verstappen. If you can do that it's gold."", ""Can't believe this needs to be explained again, the gaps in shit cars will naturally be smaller because the ceiling is low. That means that the better driver can only get so much out of it.\n\nIf you put Max and Lawson in last year's VCARB together, Max's gap to Lawson would be less than it is now they're in the Red Bull. Why? Because the Red Bull has a higher ceiling, whilst the floor of any car is obviously infinite.\n\nThe better a car, the higher the potential. Look at it this way. You're in two different races vs Usain Bolt, a 5m sprint and a 100m sprint. You're going to be far closer to Bolt in the 5m sprint than the 100m sprint because the superior competitor doesn't have the potential to fully extract and show off their capabilities because of the parameters at hand. In this case a short distance vs a longer one, which is the slower car vs a faster car equivalent. He can however murder you as you waddle and stumble over the 100m line because there's far more potential to show off his capabilities when the parameters open up.\n\nFwiw, Lawson had a fresh PU for his spell vs Yuki last year whilst Yuki had to manage his existing PUs from Belgium onwards.You've also got to add context. If both drivers have clean sessions and put in the same number of laps on the same compound per session, then it's comparable. But if one driver has a messy session then the gap might not be pure pace but a result of circumstance, like the half second in COTA. Yuki had two lap times deleted, which is driver error, he needs to hold that, but that meant his timed lap was extremely conservative and not a completely authentic representation of his pace.\n\nLawson's quicker times here are by fractions in sprint sessions on mediums, with the updated floor in Brazil sprint (Yuki didn't have it that weekend) and the aforementioned COTA qualifying where Yuki had a stinker Q1 and then they didn't even run Lawson in Q2. Yuki did go on to actually qualify 11th for that race although he still didn't have a great lap then either.""]",0,66,0.35,0,424,424,0,2,-0.010000000000000009,0

And it's not just due to being continuously beaten on a technical level but the team has been run rather unprofessionally for quite a long time now. Just look at the kind of mistakes they do again and again. 

Memes are all fun and games but ultimately Ferrari's lack of competitiveness hurts the sport overall. This year it was clear that only Ferrari can challenge McLaren for the WCC but just 2 races in it already feels like game over for the WCC. 

In other sports like Football, teams who were once considered very prestigious like Man United lose interest from top players after not winning for an extended period of time and as a result the brand loses its value.

It looked nailed on around Spa that Ricciardo would be jumping into the Red Bull, numerous reports that the Verstappen camp fully expected it and were surprised when it didn’t materialise for whatever reason. Once that decision was made the writing was really on the wall, but I don’t think anyone really expected them to pull the trigger mid season like they did. In my opinion, they should’ve given him to the end of the year and if they’d made the decision to get rid of Checo, could’ve lined up like this in 2025:

RBR: Verstappen/Ricciardo
RB: Tsunoda/Lawson

Hadjar as reserve wouldn’t have been the worst move for his career, and if Ricciardo struggled they then had the option of swapping one of Lawson or Tsunoda into the seat. A year or two would’ve been Daniel’s max stint anyway and that time to develop would’ve benefitted Lawson and allowed Hadjar his route into the sport.

The advantage Ricciardo offered was his years of experience on what by all accounts is a difficult car, and the fact he likes a pointy front end similar to Max and so set up wise they’d be more aligned. It would also give us an insight into just how far Max’s set up has taken the car, and also once and for all answered the Ricciardo question.
