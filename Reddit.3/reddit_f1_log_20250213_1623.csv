1inupbk,Opinion:  Haas and Aston-Martin are the biggest X factors this year.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1inupbk/opinion_haas_and_astonmartin_are_the_biggest_x/,2025-02-12, Discussion,"Haas, of course, gained access to greater technical resources than they've ever had before with their new partnership with Toyota.  If Komatsu is what he appears to be, they have a chance to move forward into the midpack for only the second time in their history in 2025.  It might not work, but a window to move forward has appeared for the team for the first time in at least 4 years.  

With many of the big players focusing significant resources on the 2026 regulation changes there's an opportunity to make some short term noise for one year, nail the final year of the old regulation to move up into the P5 range for one year to enhance their reputation, then accept you'll be a little behind on the new regs and play catchup eyeing 2027.  

or they could play it safe, look to 2026 and not worry too much about the car this year in the same way Vowles says he's going to do.

Bottom line:  With new backing and access to improved facilities, Haas has greater upside than they've had in awhile, and it'll be interesting to see if they can capitalize on it.

  
As for why I bring up Aston Martin, that should be reasonably obvious.  They don't lack for talent, and their facilities have improved considerably in the last 3 years, but they have a reputation of being one of the most directionless teams in formula 1.  For those of us familiar with the American NFL, I've referred to Lawrence Stroll as the Jerry Jones of Formula 1, which is still an apt comparison.  High profile signings. lack of coherent vision, a fetish for ""pet"" players that are somehow immovable even while they fail to get the job done.

The problem at Aston Martin is not a lack of resources, or good drivers.  Alonso is great, and Lance, despite the meme that he is, has his moments and is an adequate second driver.  But there is a vast lack of coherent vision at Aston-Martin.  The talent that Jerry... sorry Larry is bringing in is from different teams with different schools of thought, brought in without regard for how well their ideas mesh together, and without ownership making executive decisions on exactly how they want to attack the regulations, all the talent and facilities in the world won't create a great car.  Just ask Ferrari.  

Larry's identity seems to be simply be ""I have a lot of money and therefore should win.""  That doesn't work in a universe with a cost cap.  You have to have some idea what kind of car you want to build.  Fast in the straights, quick in the corners, light and agile or heavy and powerful.  You have the talent, personnel, facilities and drivers to do any of those things, but not all of them at once.  So pick one.

If Aston manages to figure that out they can move up in 2025.  But ironically the best chance of Aston figuring this out is if Lance, who has been front and center suffering from this rudderless, flailing, throw-crap-at-the-wall style of management, gains more pull on the management side of the team and his near decade of F1 driving experience allows Lance to come up with a concrete improvement plan, decide what HE wants to do, run it by his dad's people and starts building an actual identity for the team himself.  Will it happen who knows, but from where I'm sitting, it's the best chance for Aston to move forward and not backward.","['Maybe Aston Martin needs to build a car... for COMBAT.', ""Haas's performance has always largely been dictated by the performance of the Ferrari, rather than anything to do with management/team principals. It's no coincidence their cars mirrored each other in their areas of improvement last year. That will probably change this year with them deciding not to go down Ferrari's pull rod suspension route, so it will be interesting to see how they handle that."", 'Late season AM is gonna be really interesting, they‚Äôll be going at 100 percent by then with Adrian N and their facilities complete', ""With the new regs coming any mid to back marker team could be an x factor if they decide to keep working in this year's car after the others have moved on."", 'Even AM themselves don‚Äôt expect to really improve this year.\nThey‚Äôre all in on 2026 regs now.', 'That‚Äôs a huge jump.

1io1wnc,"Recent seasons ""cleaner"" than the past?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1io1wnc/recent_seasons_cleaner_than_the_past/,2025-02-12, Discussion,"During this winter break I've been watching highlights from prior seasons to fill the time (thank you F1TV). They summarize each race in about 10-15min highlight videos.

So far I've watched 2009-2011, partway through 2012, and 2016. 

Prior to this, I've watched 2021-current live/during the season itself. 

My main observation from these older seasons is the prevelance of crashes, DNFs, and drive through penalties. It seems these past seasons had large percentages of those three compared to the last few seasons. '21 to now from what I've seen the drive through penalty isn't used nearly as often, there aren't huge crashes at every race, and most of the time the cars finish the races.

Any particular reasoning for this? Maybe what I'm noticing isn't actually true? Any thoughts? ","[""Back in the day the drive thru was the lightest penalty available. Nowadays 5 and 10 second penalties are applied almost every race, so I'm not quite sure what you're seeing about today's racing being cleaner."", 'The Super License system, as much as it forces young drivers through the FIA-sanctioned support series, has improved the average driver quality. Latifi and Mazapin looked like championship material compared to some of the pay drivers of the past. And the higher talent floor has been made clear though the reduction in crashes. \n\nAs for mechanical DNFs, the rules now limit the maximum number of engines and gearboxes (and components) that can be used before you start taking grid penalties. This has forced teams to design more durable parts.', 'Driving standards are FAR higher now than they used to be.\n\n20 years ago, Yuji Ide was so bad that his super license was revoked after only four races.\n\nNow we have Lance Stroll, who has 3 podiums and a pole position, as the worst driver on the grid.\n\nI think the current grid could make most drivers from back then look like amateurs.', 'Lots of answers here, but something that hasn‚Äôt been mentioned is that the cost cap rewards clean driving because you can‚Äôt just keep manufacturing replacements anymore.\n\nLook at Williams vs Alpine last year - at the start of the season both teams did not have a spare chassis. That bit Williams in the arse by race 3. Williams got to the point they were having to ask Mercedes for heritage parts, and they were running old spec parts at the end because they didn‚Äôt have anything else left. Alpine developed new ones because they weren‚Äôt trying to replace the old ones, so had development to the end of the season. \n\nIt encourages a balance of being fast vs not needlessly binning it.', 'One of the drivers, can‚Äôt remember which, said that the current cars are much harder to drive at the limit. So most of the drivers are pushing at about 90-95% because ultimately that is faster than 100% when accounting for mistakes that come with that. That helps to reduce DNFs and crashes.', 'Past races were more open, w/o so many regulations.\xa0 My two cents.', ""The cars do most of the work nowadays thanks to the crazy ground effect downforce, whereas in the past drivers had to fight the cars more to get a lap time out of them. Add in tyres that can't be pushed and it becomes a pretty sanitised product."", 'The most recent season\'s have been much cleaner, and it can actually be attributed to this generation of cars and spec. I really wish I could find the article, but there was something that came out where current driver\'s were asked, and essentially with the ground effect cars, the way to extract the most lap time isn\'t to drive at 100%, but more \'smoothly\' and only at 80%-90% of potential. I think that goes a long way\'s to why we are seeing cleaner racing as of late; they aren\'t quite on the ragged edge in races as we used to see. That, along with other aspects such as cost cap, teams emphasizing and developing reliability vs. outright performance due to grid penalties, and just better drivers (less traditional pay driver\'s than previous decades of F1) all contribute to recent season\'s being ""cleaner"".', 'Well no one has emerged from a fiery wreck in years so yeah']",24,44,0.69,24,321,321,1,1,0.009999999999999898,1

Some will say that he left because he is too afraid to take the fight to Verstappen, and I won't fault the idea because it appears that way, but I think he knows that this is a decision that he must take, to preserve the prime of his career whilst Verstappen is blossoming into his\n\nBut you asked for my personal answer. And maybe I will throw in a curveball. Maybe the answer does not lie with Renault or McLaren either. Maybe it should have been with another team. Reductive answer, I know. But I just don't know how things would have played out if there are only small tweaks to his Renault and McLaren moves.\n\nIf he had joined McLaren a lot earlier than 2021, there is a possibility that he would be able to adapt a lot faster but he was already struggling with the McLaren before the ground effect regulations came in. There is also the chance that this would have accelerated his inability to manage the car a lot quicker. Joining Renault was a bold move but a welcome one, considering there was a promise that the team will be built relatively around him but I get why he left as well. Correct me if I am mistaken, but I have heard of rumours of instability within the team structure, and disputes within his own camp. If the dynamics are already shaky, why stay put? I am currently watching some 2019 races and the ones I did happen to watch for now, saw him going through some really tough luck. 2020 did appear promising with how he ended that year, but with that offer to McLaren, which at the time, would be the better prospect, I cannot say I blame him.\n\nAs for who McLaren should have signed in 2021, if not for Ricciardo? Tough call. Maybe Sainz should have been retained? A race win in 2021 would not have been in the cards but there was a solid possibility McLaren could have gotten to the front a lot faster. Not saying I would change anything now but I am trying to see what can be deduced from my predictions. Or they could have brought in another rookie from the time, but I simply do not see it being Albon. In another lifetime, I would have taken stabs in the dark and maybe gunned for a bolder choice like Russell. A Norris-Russell dynamic would have been fiery, but alas, that is just a guess\n\nThere is no right or wrong answer on my end. Ricciardo did what he had to do. And I'll be happy to expand on my thought process / rescind to give it more thought before I comment on a Ricciardo post in the future üòÖ. Thought I'll add to the discussion a little"", 'In an ideal hindsight world he should probably have stayed at Red Bull if he purely wanted to pad his stats more, but he would soon have found his stock diminished there by a rapidly rising Max anyway. \n\nIn reality, with him not having the benefit of hindsight, both his moves made total sense at the time. He could see the writing on the wall at Red Bull, and Renault, a manufacturer team with a history of F1 success were offering him a huge multi-year contract to be their lead driver in their quest to get back up the grid. Then, with having likely seen plenty within Renault for that one year to realise how dysfunctional things actually were there, moving to McLaren as Sainz‚Äôs replacement - an historical giant of a team who were once again on the up, with a lot more internal stability than Renault and offering him another huge multi-year contract to be their lead driver - made sense as well. He wasn‚Äôt to know when he signed the contract prior to the 2020 season that he was running headlong into a rapidly-rising Norris, nor that his own ability to adapt had some severe limitations.\n\nAs for McLaren, if they had not signed Ricciardo. they could have opted for Vettel, as he was on the market once Sainz took his seat at Ferrari.']",0,59,0.42,0,405,405,0,1,0.0,0
