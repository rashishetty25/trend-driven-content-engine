This has me wondering‚Äîshould Pirelli bring back the 2018-style naming and color convention to improve clarity?

Back in 2018, each compound had its own name and color (e.g., Hypersoft, Ultrasoft, Supersoft...), which made it easier for fans to distinguish performance gaps. Since 2019, Pirelli has simplified this into just ‚ÄúSoft,‚Äù ‚ÄúMedium,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHard‚Äù regardless of which actual compound is selected, but that‚Äôs led to some confusion‚Äîespecially when C2 is called ‚ÄúSoft‚Äù one weekend and C5 gets the same label another.

So with six compounds now in regular use, and possibly staying that way into 2026 and beyond, is it time to revisit or modernize the naming system? Maybe bring back unique names and colors‚Äîor at least tweak the current system to reduce ambiguity?

Curious to hear what others think‚Äîwould reintroducing distinct compound names make things clearer, or is the current format better for casual fans?","[""I liked the rainbow, but I understand why some people didn't. Always sounded cooler when they called it the hypersoft."", 'I liked the pirelli rainbow more than what we have now. but i understand the ease of understanding just Soft - Medium - Hard and using C1-C6 for the more hardcore technical fanbase. \n\nFor someone who has no clue about the details behind the tires. Knowing that Soft goes fast but not far, Hard goes far but less fast. And medium goes in between. Is simple. Instead of having to remember one week, why they are driving on Ultrasoft, supersoft and soft tires. And the next week all of a sudden superhard, hard and medium tires.   \nHaving the same colour scheme across every week also helps distinguishing between what the soft medium or hards are. Instead having to remember this week we have orange which is the hardest, blue which is the medium, and white which is the softest. just for it to be a week later be blue for the hardest, and another race having white as the hardest tire. \n\nAnd using C1-C6 just removes any confusion between it.', "">easier for fans to distinguish performance gaps.\n\nIf everyone's tires are the same 3 compounds in a race, does it really matter? Having a different compound be called soft on different tracks doesn't really seem to make much of a difference since you can't compare across tracks directly anyways"", 'No, because it\'s terrible for viewing. Right now when you are watching a race, and you see someone pitting and putting on the ""Soft"" tyre, you know that they have put on the softest available tyre and you know they are going for a short and quick stint.\n\n\nBut with the old naming system, where ""Super Soft"" wasn\'t even the softest tyre at some tracks, you would basically have to memorise which specific tyres are available for that weekend and so if someone puts on the ""Super Soft"" when the ""Hyper Soft"" is available, it is confusing. It makes the racing much harder to follow.\n\n\nHaving the softest available for that race be the Soft, Medium, and Hard, makes the racing so much easier to follow.', ""No, the current format is better in pretty much every way. There's no loss of information, the most relevant information to the vast majority of fans is clearly visible, yet the detail of which compounds are being used is readily available.\n\nThe old system just had unnecessary confusion"", 'The Pirelli rainbow range (or whatever you want to call it) was fine for the more hardcore audience who new what compounds were being brought each weekend, but I imagine it was confusing as hell if you didn‚Äôt know what they had - one weekend one colour might have been the softest but the next it was the hardest. Was just an unnecessary barrier to entry for a newer viewer and left them at the mercy of the commentators explaining it every time. Current system is perfect because at a glance you know what‚Äôs going on.', "">\xa0Curious to hear what others think‚Äîwould reintroducing distinct compound names make things clearer, or is the current format better for casual fans?\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nThe current format is the best for **during** the race.\n\n\nThe most important thing during the race is the relationship of the compounds to each other. Soft medium hard\xa0\n\n\nInstantly at a glance no matter the *actual* compounds used I know the relationship.\n\n\nAfter the race I can quibble about ultra vs super, C4 vs C5.\xa0\n\n\nBut during the race it's quicker to comprehend the difference between soft medium hard, red yellow white without understanding Ultra super mega hyper soft..."", ""Minor point, the C2 can't be called a soft. It can be a hard (C2-C3-C4) or a medium (C1-C2-C3).\n\n\nCurrent format is best. It‚Äôs clear, it's concise.\xa0"", 'F1 fans seem to have this weird obsession with specific things from the past. I don\'t get it. The current naming and colouring scheme is objectively easier to understand and identify easily. For the super casual fans, they can pretty easily understand that a soft is fast but short lived, a hard is slow but long lived, and a medium is in between, and this is a blanket statement that applies to every single race.\n\nFor the more well-versed fans, ""hard...hypersoft"" is functionally identical to ""C1...C6"". Anyone who actually cares (like me) about which specific compounds are being brought to each specific race can and probably do easily look it up, it\'s not that hard and doesnt take away from or add to the enjoyment of the sport.\n\nKeep it simple on top for those who dont care and add layer of complexity a bit deeper for those who care.']",445,146,0.84,445,3217,3217,2,0,0.0,2

Kinda wish they switched earlier then.', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **Finally, Alpine has delivered, just as the test drives had promised. Pierre Gasly starts fifth in the Bahrain GP and lost only 0.375 seconds to pole position. Despite an engine handcap of three tenths.**\n\n> It‚Äôs a round birthday. Alpine chief renovator Flavio Briatore was 75 years old on the day of qualifying for the Bahrain GP. When Pierre congratulated Gasly in the morning, the eternally young Italian asked: ‚ÄúAnd, what did you bring me as a birthday present?‚Äù Gasly pointed to his right foot. A heavy gas foot should straighten it.\n\n> Alpine had arrived with zero points for the fourth round of the World Championship. The only team was still empty, and the French cars had left a very good impression during the winter test drives in Bahrain. But it seemed to be swept away in Melbourne, Shanghai and Suzuka.\n\n> Briatore stood in front of his troop: ‚ÄúWe were not as bad as we looked. Our problem was that we never got what was theoretically possible out of the softest tire compound.‚Äù This resulted in poor starting positions and correspondingly difficult races. The team did not travel to Bahrain with a single point. This is not the claim that Alpine had before the 2025 Formula 1 season. They wanted to be ‚ÄúBest Of The Rest‚Äù and annoy the top teams McLaren, Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes.\n\n> **Engine costs lap time.**\nThe Renault engine is not a rocket with which you can win places. ‚ÄúWe lose three to four tenths of the drive alone, depending on the route,‚Äù Briatore curses. It‚Äôs the old problem. The engine has to be into charging mode too early on the straights to fill the battery. For Bahrain, the loss according to the simulation is 0.3 seconds.\n\n> And yet, with 1.30.216 minutes, Gasly managed a time that was only 0.375 seconds above Oscar Piastri‚Äôs pole position. ‚ÄúWithout the loss of the engine, we start from the front row,‚Äù Briatore is convinced. Gasly impressed especially in the second sector, where he was practically as fast as the McLaren drivers. It is the sector with the most curves in which time goes flutes. This is shown to the engineers: The car is aerodynamically healthy.\n\n> It could have gone better in the first three races, Briatore is annoyed. The error was that the engineers had tried to compensate for the power deficit elsewhere. For example, with the differential setting. ‚ÄúThe experiments didn‚Äôt help,‚Äù says the master craftsman. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I told the team before the weekend: no more experiments. We‚Äôre driving like in the test.‚Äù\n\n> **Grace period for Doohan.**\nThe Alpine also kept its tyre temperatures in the window for the entire lap. Pierre Gasly and Jack Doohan did not lose a disproportionate amount of time in the last stretch, unlike some competitors. The fact that Gasly also took sixth place in the third training session in shearing heat is a good sign. Even there, the tire temperatures did not shoot through the ceiling.\n\n> Jack Doohan was also on his way to Q3. The Australian came in sixth place through Q1 and had a good chance of getting one lap further even after the first attempt in Q2. But then, in the last attempt, Doohan no longer brought all sectors together optimally. ‚ÄúHe still has to work on that,‚Äù the team said. ‚ÄúJack is fast, but not yet constant.‚Äù According to recent information, despite his two accidents in Melbourne and Japan, he still has a grace period until summer.', '‚ÄúWhat did you bring me as a birthday present‚Äù and Gasly gives him a second row.

Thus, PIA gets a better exit, and builds more speed through the T2&3 combination. When coming to T4, PIA lifts earlier and more gradual, coming to 0% at nearly the same point as NOR, who, brakes earlier and longer. Coming at nearly the same speed to the S-Combination of T5/6/7. Before T6, PIA brakes earlier, allowing for a better exit and not having to lift-off as much as NOR through T7. Approach to T8 is nigh identical, but PIA was earlier back on the throttle and NOR had to feather for a moment, costing him a bit of speed. Coming to the Tilke-Special of T9/10, NOR lifts later again and PIA brakes later, again. PIA gets a slightly better exit, capping at a higher top speed before T11. There, PIA lifts later, which lets NOR have a better exit and gaining back a bit on PIA. But T13: PIA lifts and brakes later, carrying more speed into the corner and having a slightly worse exit as NOR. T14 doesn't shake anything up, yet again, PIA lifts way earlier and more gradual than NOR, who is also braking earlier and longer.

Conclusion: Difficult. Their respective car control is remarkably similar. PIA brakes later and finds better exits, having overall a bit more confidence in the car. The approaches to T4 and T14 are quite extreme, with PIA starting to lift-off 90 and 60 metres, respectively, earlier than NOR (if the data of FastF1 is to be trusted). My guess: After seeing the live delta to PIA on his dash after T3, NOR went all in, staying on the throttle longer than usual, thus paying with worse exits, which cost him even more time. And if I may delve into the crystal ball: NOR was standing in his own way, starting to drive with a clenched jaw upon glancing at the live delta inbetween T3&4. Probably cost him the front row.","['Oh my days. Actual analysis instead of ‚Äúmentality‚Äù talk.

1jxrhzv,Will Lando Norris Be Daniel Ricciardo 2.0?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jxrhzv/will_lando_norris_be_daniel_ricciardo_20/,2025-04-12, Discussion,"Daniel Ricciardo used to be seen as a future World Champ. He was fast, had the personality, and won races. But things started to shift at Red Bull when Max Verstappen joined. Danny was still good, but Max just kept getting better, and it felt like the team gradually leaned more toward him. Eventually, Danny left for Renault, saying he wanted a new challenge.

Later on, he ended up at McLaren with Lando Norris. On paper, Danny was the experienced one, but on track, Lando was usually ahead. Danny had a great win at Monza in 2021, but week to week, Lando was the more consistent one. Over time, that performance gap kind of pushed Danny out of the team, and out of top-team conversations altogether.

Now, Lando‚Äôs the one in that senior driver role. McLaren‚Äôs finally built a car that can win, and he‚Äôs expected to lead the team. But his teammate, Oscar Piastri, has been right there with him and sometimes even ahead. Lando might be the quicker one overall, but Oscar‚Äôs been more consistent and seems less fazed under pressure. If Lando keeps missing out at key moments, McLaren might start leaning into Oscar‚Äôs consistency instead.

In Bahrain qualifying just recently, Oscar took pole. Lando ended up P6 and looked pretty frustrated after. Then there was that Max comment from earlier, where he said if he were in the McLaren, ‚Äúyou wouldn‚Äôt have seen me.‚Äù Lando was asked about it, and honestly, it kind of looked like it got to him.

Is Lando just under pressure, or are we starting to see a Ricciardo 2.0 situation? (I really hope not. He's too young though, and it's still very early to say. But still, just asking the question.)","['In fairness to Daniel his peak was during the Mercedes era, he never had a proper car to compete for a title. \n\nYou could make the argument he was the best driver in F1 for the 2016 season, nobody has ever said Lando was the best driver in F1 over a season.', 'Has there ever been a season in recent memory where ""It\'s just been a couple of races, give it some time to see how everything plays out"" been more relevant on so many topics?', 'Daniel never had the fastest car', 'Time will tell but for starters Ricciardo never had the quickest car in his time competing in Formula 1.', ""Lando is really fast. Imo faster than Oscar and also more consistent over a season. Idk if Oscar can cover that gap this year but it's going to be interesting to see. Ricciardo didn't have the fastest car in his prime career so they are really hard to compare. Also their positions in their teams are different. Ricciardo was not embedded in RBR the way Lando has been at McL. Lando has been at McL for ages. Ricciardo was probably the favored driver at RBR from second half of 2014 to the point Max got Kvyat's seat. He really didn't have the type of roots Lando has at McL. \n\nI know folks sometimes compare Lando to Lewis. To me they have pretty different attitudes when they are in spotlight. Lewis on track is a monster when he is under pressure. His low moments are usually when he isn't fighting for something which is important to him. Lewis at AD 2016 backing Nico into Vettel or Verstappen was really the type of beast he is when he's under pressure. Even like last year when Max had that crazy race in Hungary and nearly took Lewis out, Lewis wasn't really flustered or anything.\n\nedited to add - The more relevant comparison imo is George and Kimi. George is in his prime career years, incredible form. That's where Ricciardo was when Max entered the team. Max was on the pace from Day 1 just like Kimi in Mercedes now. Oscar had more of a gradual progress."", 'Nah, good grief, one slightly off quali session and your ""DR‚ÄôING"" him ?!', ""Lando has beaten Oscar both years they've been together"", 'Lando just reminds me of 95/96 Damon Hill to be honest. Fast driver, fastest car, yet still makes winning look much harder than it should be.', 'I hate this community sometimes']",0,57,0.29,0,55,55,0,57,0.29,0
