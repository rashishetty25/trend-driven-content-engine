1osgskk,I looked at 800 overtakes from the last 30+ years at Interlagos. Here’s where you actually want to sit,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1osgskk/i_looked_at_800_overtakes_from_the_last_30_years/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"I’ve always heard people say the Senna S is the best place to watch the Brazilian GP, but I wanted to know if that’s actually true. So I went through data from the past 30+ years (roughly 1990–2023) and looked at around **800 on-track overtakes** at Interlagos to see where the action really happens.

**Main Straight / Start–Finish, Best overall**  
About half of all overtakes happen here. The long DRS zone and slipstreaming make it the busiest part of the circuit, and you see cars pull out to pass right in front of you. Plus you get the start, pit stops, and podium. **Grandstand A** is the go-to spot if you want overtakes and atmosphere in one.

**Turn 1 (Senna S), Pure action**  
Roughly a quarter of the overtakes happen here. Cars come flying down the straight and dive under braking. It’s chaotic on lap 1 and great throughout the race.  
**Grandstand M** sits right at the end of the straight with a perfect view into the Senna S, while **Grandstand B** is slightly further back but still sees the braking zone and the start of the corner.

**Turn 4 (Descida do Lago), Underrated gem**  
Around 10 % of the overtakes happen here. It’s the second DRS zone, downhill, and you often get side-by-side moves that carry through the corner. **Grandstand G** looks straight down the hill and gives a great sense of speed.

**Best spot**  
If you combine the main straight and Turn 1, you’re looking at roughly **80 % of all overtakes** over the past three decades, which matches what most F1 analysis sites say about Interlagos’ two DRS braking zones being where nearly everything happens.

**Turn-by-Turn Ranking (top 8)**

| Rank | Location       | Total Overtakes | % of Total | Avg/Race |
|------|----------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| 1    | Main Straight  | 471             | 53.2%      | 14.7     |
| 2    | Turn 1         | 227             | 25.6%      | 7.1      |
| 3    | Turn 4         | 80              | 9.0%       | 2.5      |
| 4    | Turn 2         | 24              | 2.7%       | 0.8      |
| 5    | Turn 6         | 19              | 2.1%       | 0.6      |
| 6    | Turn 3         | 13              | 1.5%       | 0.4      |
| 7    | Turn 10        | 10              | 1.1%       | 0.3      |
| 8    | Turn 12        | 9               | 1.0%       | 0.3      |

**TL;DR:**

* **Main Straight (Grandstand A)** – best all-round experience and most overtakes (~50% of overtakes)
* **Turn 1 (Grandstand M or B)** – most dramatic corner action (~25% of overtakes)
* **Turn 4 (Grandstand G)** – cheaper and still plenty going on (~9% of overtakes)

If you can get a seat that shows both the straight and the Senna S, you’ll catch almost all the overtakes live.

This year hasn't been great, but it's not the absolute worst season of Ferrari. They had worse ones. For example, 2020, when they had the worst result since 40 years. They had worse one in 2014, when alonso had to drive the most unstable car in f1 that had unique ability to understeer and oversteer at the same time. 

I just watched brazilian GP after another double DNF, but it's not like Ferrari is fighting for anything. Their real last chance is gonna be in Las Vegas. 

But there have definitely been a lot more painful moments for Ferrari team than today's race or double dsq in China.

1oss62o,The Brazil GP's logistical issues to locals in capitol São Paulo - as seen by a local,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oss62o/the_brazil_gps_logistical_issues_to_locals_in/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"So as we all know, we just finished up the Brazilian GP at Interlagos. I have no idea as to if this is against the rules or not (as this is more of a rant instead of a technical writeup), but I'd assume it does due to this being a writeup about how the Brazilian GP is like to the locals - as whiny as it might sound like.

For some ungodly reason, [ENEM (acronym translates to National High School Exam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exame_Nacional_do_Ensino_M%C3%A9dio), basically an SAT-type exam with 90 + 90 questions and an essay over two Sundays that students take in order to either get into federal/public college, or get a scholarship/free ride into private college) also takes place this Sunday and the next. An issue that has been true since the Brawn GP days [(there's literally a news article from 2010 about students from Zona Sul (the region near Interlagos) having a hard time getting to the exams due to the increased traffic from F1)](https://g1.globo.com/educacao/noticia/2010/11/formula-1-prejudica-estudantes-do-enem-na-zona-sul-de-sp.html)
For very obvious reasons, traffic jams are extremely common near the school/college buildings the exam takes place at all over the country, and due to São Paulo being a gigantic city this issue compounds even further there. If the roads and the subway system are already crowded enough in a regular day, then it gets absolutely bizarre during F1 week, even more so with ENEM and this is compounded even further when we factor in other events/shows that normally take place nearby (like the Morumbis stadium or Allianz Parque).

However, ENEM can't take place in January because that'd be too close a deadline for the grades to be up and ready to be released by February (when colleges and universities start taking new students), and by December all schools/colleges are on summer break, which leaves us with November. Specifically, the one Sunday in where the F1 circus shows up with almost 300k fans in tow (because logistical issues regarding the calendar and weather mean the Brazil GP has to happen in early November). Not even considering other events like Linkin Park's show because those are far and between, only ENEM that takes place literally every year since 1998.

Of course foreigners can take a plane to São Paulo and back (as such only dealing with the local and foreigner traffic inside the city), but locals will most likely be going to the GP by car, which means dealing with both F1 and Linkin Park traffic.

Seriously... this has been an issue for almost 20 years, it would've been way more manageable both for the locals driving to their jobs, the locals taking ENEM, the foreigners and the locals going to the GP if both events didn't take place in the exact same weekend. Specially because the city of São Paulo are the ones funding the GP, meaning they absolutely have incentive to make sure the dates don't clash.","[""An exam taking place on Sunday, especially in a Christian country, is wild to me.\n\nSaturday it's ok, but placing a school event on Sunday in Italy would mean riot."", 'As much as I love to watch the race, having high school students suffer with traffic etc to get to their exams is painful to see.

And the people from Seventh-day Adventist Church get to do the exam on another time.\n\nSo whats you point?"", ""Brazil is a secular country\n\nThe population being majority Christian really shouldn't matter."", ""Every Christian country I'm familiar with (Italy, San Marino, Switzerland especially Ticino, Spain, etc.) observes Sunday as an hard holy day and so most public offices, schools included, are closed.

Q1 started with Max going out very early and being one of the first drivers to do a hot lap. He does one and puts the car outside Top 5 but still in a decent position. He then pits early. 

While he is in pits, everyone else goes out and put their respective times on board as the track ramps up. This includes Tsunoda who benefits from the same. Then everyone pits after their first lap, including Yuki. 

After everyone pits except Lewis, Max goes out again and does a hot lap. His car slides in Turn 9 which costs him 0.5 second. He improves but only to P16. 

Now this is the critical part. He does a cooldown lap while everyone else is still in the pits. Then he does another cooldown lap. Then he goes for his second hot lap while everyone comes out of pits, including Yuki. 

So he had more fuel than others, enough to do 2 cooldown laps and a hot lap. And his tyres were also worn down compared to everyone else using brand new set of tyres for only one lap. 

Despite this, Max only misses out by half a tenth in his second and final hot lap. He misses out Q2 by just one position. Even Yuki with a fresh set of tyres is slower by 2 or 3 tenths. 

If Red Bull had put him on low fuel and allowed him to do a single hot lap and then pitted him for a second time, he could've put a better time easily. Granted that Max made a mistake in first hot lap but there was 5 minutes left. It was enough to pit and go out again for another hot lap. 

Red Bull clearly ran a different strategy for Max. They wanted him to either save a third set of softs or believed that the soft tyre could last that long, which doesn't make sense because everyone else, including Yuki, only did one lap on softs in the end. 

This is also not the first time that they have fumbled the qualifying strategy. Max wasn't able to do a second hot lap in Austin because he went out too late. Yuki has also been a victim recently. ","['well, >99% of the time, Verstappen will be good enough to make it through with those used softs. Yesterday not. Shit happens', ""He's not made it out because the car is difficult to drive and he's made mistakes because of it. His first lap of his final run would have probably got him through to Q2 without the slide at T9.\n\nIf they'd sent him out with only 1 lap of fuel and he'd had the same T9 slide he would have been P18 instead of P16, so the slide is the issue (which will have also damaged his tyres more and hurt his second lap), not the plan itself.\n\nThe other side of this is that the driver usually has input into the plan for Qualifying, and Max has a lot of power at Red Bull, so I very much doubt they sent him out early with extra fuel without getting him to agree to it."", ""Was he slow because of the strategy or because they completely fumbled the car's setup? I'd say it seems to be more the latter."", 'The driver also has input in the qualifying strategy. They took a risk to change the setup from FP and the sprint, after Max complained, and Max probably wanted two laps to feel the new car setup.', 'So you mean he did almost or exactly the same run plan that Norris did yesterday in q3 that resultet in two times fast enough for pole?\n\nSounds not like the run plan was the biggest issue here. 🤷\u200d♂️', ""Red Bull also didn't use slipstreaming tactics in Mexico quali, which I can't understand if you still try to fight for the title.\n\nThey also used weird stragetys for Verstappen in the Zandvoort race, and were saved by safety cars.\n\nAnd the call to pit for hards in spain... yeah, no need to talk about it."", ""Hadn't really paid attention to this (thanks for pointing it out), but I was definitely shocked to see that Q1 exit...because his first lap was around 0.2/0.3ish off the top before the track evo on USED softs. That definitely did not seem like a P16 final quali result at the time😅"", 'It was a fumble for sure but now they have a chance to work on the car and give him a new PU.', 'The gap between P1 and P15 is not the same on every track. RB knew that softs couldn\'t last very long and others were going for one hot lap, including Yuki. \n\nThe slide in Turn 9 may be ""shit happens"" but not this.']",14,20,0.61,14,19,19,14,20,0.61,14

1osfra3,Lewis Hamilton & Ferrari - a discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1osfra3/lewis_hamilton_ferrari_a_discussion/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"I'm wondering in people are able to help me understand a little bit about the history of Scuderia Ferrari, the team dynamics, and whether it's realistic for Hamilton to be successful there before he retires. A few facts below.

* With respect to the Constructors and Drivers Championships, and in absolute terms, Ferrari are the most successful F1 team in history with 16 and 15 titles respectively. The second and third most successful teams are McLaren and Williams
* Ferrari's last Driver Championship is held by Raikkonen, won in 2007 and the last Constructors Championship was won in 2008. This means a Drivers title hasn't been won there for 18 years
* Since that period, 7 drivers have driven for Ferrari: Alonso, Massa, Vettel, Raikkonen, Leclerc, Sainz, and Hamilton. Out of those 7 drivers, 4 are World Champions and 3 are multiple World Champions
* Being a historic Italian outfit and almost a ""religion"" in Italy, Ferrari are based there, whereas most other teams (aside from a couple) are based in the UK
* Several individuals were instrumental in bringing Hamilton across to Ferrari including those with significant power i.e.,
   * Jon Elkan - Chairman and major stakeholder
   * Fred Vasseur - Team Principal
* Lewis Hamilton is now 40 years old however it was only 4 years ago (2021) when he finished 2nd in the Drivers Championship and 2 years ago (2023) when he finished 3rd with unprecedented dominance in front

I could lay out some more facts but based on the above I have some questions as I genuinely do not know the answers but hoping some folks can provide some more colour...

*  Why are Ferrari reluctant to shake up their team or are seemingly reluctant to take constructive feedback from their drivers (including a 7 time world champion) when what they have been doing for the last 18 years clearly hasn't been working?
* Hamilton has been in race winning cars since the start of career so why does it appear his feedback and/or constructive criticism isn't being well received? Drivers input is surely significant given that Schumacher is widely credited with helping drive forward the dominant Ferrari of the past
* Leclerc is of course a brilliant driver, however Hamilton is a champion. I know some people call him a rocket ship merchant but people have short memories and there are countless examples of Hamilton brilliance. His experience is second to none
* Why for example is Jon Elkan, the Chairman, top boss, and guy who brought Hamilton over not saying we need to listen to this guy, no exceptions? it appears to me that with the team consolidated in Italy, there isn't much wiggle room
* Why are some team members who are clearly not effective such as Adami not being reshuffled or sacked?
* Some people think that Ferrari wouldn't want Hamilton to break Schumacher's records or are embarrassing him in favour of Leclerc - how much truth is there to this?
* Why would Ferrari employ a 40 year old Hamilton if they think it wouldn't work? Some people state he is old and past his prime however we have seen that only 2 years ago he came 3rd in the Championship
* What are the realistic chances Ferrari will reflect on the errors of their ways and help Hamilton secure a title?
* What is actually going on here? Surely a team isn't arrogant enough to not want to WIN and are just trading off a historical brand name.

A team needs some stability, and changing things too much or too often, especially in a reactive way like Ferrari’s done before, just makes things worse. I also find it kinda funny how everyone treats the team’s “Italian side” like it’s a problem, or the problem, but then you see some of those “incompetent Italians” doing great once they leave (Stella, Costa...) while a few of the so called foreign geniuses who joined just ended up failing or adding more confusion but I guess the agenda’s gotta keep “agending” lol.\xa0\n\nWhen it comes to Hamilton, it’s clearly just a legacy thing. I get the feeling a lot of people in the team would’ve rather stuck with Sainz, but the call came from the top so… whatever. Sure, the team should try to listen to him more, but it goes both ways, with the exception of some pr friendly statements, he hasn’t really done much to fit in.

People often talk about the bonus they get from FIA, but it’s almost like that’s their only leverage.

1oss6ag,Genuine question about midfielders vs top drivers battles...,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oss6ag/genuine_question_about_midfielders_vs_top_drivers/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"I may not know much about racing, but this always baffles me every time I hear about ""generational drive"" from anyone (and today from Max).

Why oh why don't any midfielders even atempt to take on a fight with the top drivers? In my vision they lose nothing, and may gain A LOT. This was shown in Mexico by Bearman, in Brasil by Kimi. Often they are more than capable of standing their ground and defend, or at least slow down the car behind. The legendary Alonso wall, where he was able to keep WDC behind him for the whole race. 

Now it just looks like they've been waved a blue flag, the second they see Max, Lando, Oscar or Charles in the mirror, they instantly move out the way, abandon racing line, don't even try to keep their position.

This in my opinion undermines today's Max achievement of reaching P3 from pitlane. I mean if only 6 of 19 cars is even atempting to race you, and 2 of them crash before you even warm your tires... In these conditions Logan Sergeant could have a shot at WDC. Basically every race this season feels like watching two races happening at the same time - McLaren vs Mercedes vs Leclerc vs Verstappen, and the other race is all of the other cars just getting out of the way of the ""big boys"".

And again, before MV fans tear me apart - I'm not saying his drive wasn't impressive (although Kimi's defence was even more impressive), but to he completly honest with you... If he doesn't need to race 90% of the cars, it's not THAT impressive. And we shouldn't talk about ""generational drive"" when 3 of the cars are out and the rest just lets you pass by. It's just catching up to the top and then starting to race for real. I mean if somebody starts from the pitlane, then 15 cars crash, your only opponents are Saubers and Alpines, and you are in the 3rd fastest car on the grid, you can easly achieve P1 and on paper be the best driver in history. But are you really?

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  
I'm giving MV as an EXAMPLE here, I'm not saying it's exclusive to him. I also didn't like how Lawson just jumped out the way from Piastri instead of even attempting to defend. MV's example is just the most apparent, since there's all this talk about ""generational drive"".

Just finished watching the São Paulo Grand Prix, and I think a lot of people have noticed this too. McLaren’s driver dynamic looks completely different from how it started this season.

Oscar Piastri seemed to have the upper hand earlier in the year. He was adapting quickly to upgrades, putting together strong qualifying runs, and consistently finishing near the front. Lately though, he’s still in the top five but hasn’t really been in the fight for podiums. Lando Norris, on the other hand, looks like he’s hit another level. His race weekends are a lot cleaner, his strategies have been spot on, and all those early-season reliability issues are basically gone.

At one point, I honestly thought Piastri could be a dark horse for the title based on how well-rounded his performances were. But that form feels like a distant memory now. You don’t just lose the pace and confidence you’ve shown all season in five races. And it’s not like Norris suddenly learned something completely new overnight either.

So what’s changed? Has McLaren shifted development away from this year’s car and Piastri’s struggling to find the right setup window? If that’s the case, how is Norris unaffected, especially when early in the season the talk was that Piastri had adapted more naturally to the MCL38?

Curious what people think. Is this about setup direction, confidence, or something within McLaren’s current development path and race strategy choices?

At Zandvoort, Lando had an issue with his engine that caused a DNF. Since then, he seems to have been performing better than Oscar most of the time. It reminded me of when Lewis Hamilton changed to a new power unit in 2021 and got a noticeable performance boost.

Could Lando’s improvement be related to getting a fresh power unit after Zandvoort? Or is it just better setup, confidence, or driving?

1oss8yc,Booing at Brazil podium towards Norris,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oss8yc/booing_at_brazil_podium_towards_norris/,2025-11-09, Discussion,"This is my first time posting and I think this is an important discussion to have as a standalone instead of in the daily threads.

Lando is a hated driver and obviously people have their favourites but booing especially when it’s podium time is a stretch. I am a Ferrari fan and think Lando is talented but I don’t like his attitude so it’s not like I am looking for reasons that he is “mistreated”. Max has received booing in the past as well and I disagree when that happens too but this time I thought I’d like to hear others opinions on this as well because i haven’t seen discourse around it.

Socials: I went on the f1 instagram page to see if there was any mention of it but instead the comments under posts where anti lando and pro everyone else - fine, people have their opinions, I am not too fond of him either BUT no mention of booing.

Disrespect: I come from a culture where sports and national anthems are sacred. Even if you hate a person or nation, when they are on a podium and ESPECIALLY when a national anthem is playing you sit quiet but as protest you can turn your back or walk away. During the podium I was watching F1 TV and Alex did his best to speak over the boos but it was overwhelming and obviously he had to stay quiet during the English national anthem. 

Another think to note is that I think it’s also disrespectful to the other drivers on the podium because it takes away from their experience. The biggest giveaway of this for me was poor Kimi. I was watching his reactions to the podium as it was only his second time and it’s obvious he is not as experienced on how to handle difficult situations like this one. You could see on his face when Lando was receiving the trophy and the boos were loud that he was deeply uncomfortable and tried to laugh it off when he received the trophy himself. I just thing it’s an awful situation for everyone involved.

I only became a fan post Covid  and generally there has been a shift in how crowds act nowadays in events. So my two questions for you are 1) does anyone know if booing in motorsport during podiums and anthems have always been a thing 2) what is your opinion on it","['Both Hamilton and Max were disliked in Brazil in a certain point of their careers, things change, it’s not something personal.', ""I watched Lewis serenely tell booing crowds that they were the best fans in the world. Max was booed a whole lot, even back in his podium days but also in 2021 and 2022.\n\nHonestly, Brazil actually likes Lando a lot. They've cheered him on since his rookie year and loved him for defending that one Brazillian reporter a couple years ago. If you look at the fan stages, he had pretty good reception there.  \n  \nPeople just have their own horses in a championship fight. And some Brazillians probably like Max a lot more  - probably consider him one of their own now because of the in-laws."", 'To quote Lando\n\n""Just ignore all the people talking crap about you""\n\nI don\'t think he cares if anyone boos and throws hissy fit anymore', ""I think it's ridiculous he's being booed but....\n\nVerstappen, Hamilton, Vettel all got booed. If Norris does what he's on course to do, he's just another Champion whose domination is pissing off people\n\nBelieve me, he won't give a shit if he wins"", 'If they care enough to boo you, you must be doing something right. Wear it like a badge of honor', 'Lando is a hated driver TO SOME. Same with every other driver. People tend to boo the winner more for the fact their fave driver didn’t win. And god forbid a driver win multiple races in a row.', 'Were those boos really for him? The trophy was presented to Lando by the governor of the state of São Paulo. He is a far-right extremist, extremely unpopular. So that’s questionable.', 'The hate seb/max/lewis received was far worse tbh. Seb especially. \n\nNorris just isnt that likeable to the majority of people rn. Maybe that will change over time but its part and parcel of the sport.', ""Even as a Lando fan, this conversation is sooo overdone. If anything, I welcome it considering this is the second weekend in a row he's won while facing the boos; it clearly motivates him to some extent lmao.\xa0"", 'Booing is so inoffensive that this shouldn’t be a talking point']",0,87,0.27,0,69,69,0,87,0.27,0
