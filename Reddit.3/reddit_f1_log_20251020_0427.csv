Here's the secret to his smooth operation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oaj7qy/i_analyzed_carlos_sainzs_impossible_50lap/,2025-10-19, Technical,"Like many F1 fans, I was amazed by Sainz's 50-lap opening stint in Singapore. Everyone's calling him the Smooth Operator, but I wanted to understand *how* he actually managed it with data.

I dove into the lap times using Python (FastF1 library) to compare his tyre degradation against the rest of the field and even projected what an average driver's stint might have looked like. Turns out, he was neutralizing degradation (\~0.084s/lap loss for others!) in a way almost no one else could.

I wrote up my findings and visualizations in my first Medium post ‚Äì would love for you to check it out and let me know what you think!

[https://medium.com/@shreyagantayat03/analysis-of-carlos-sainz-really-pulled-off-his-impossible-50-lap-stint-0ed573a7d8d8](https://medium.com/@shreyagantayat03/analysis-of-carlos-sainz-really-pulled-off-his-impossible-50-lap-stint-0ed573a7d8d8)

This was my first F1 data project, so any feedback is super helpful. Are you interested in seeing more analyses like this (e.g., Safety Car impacts, undercut vs. overcut, other Grand Prix analysis, Drama factor analysis)? Let me know your suggestions!","['I\'ve got to commend you for creating something, but I\'m actually annoyed I wasted my time reading that article. ZERO answer is given, I\'ve learned absolutely nothing new about how he was able to go 50 laps, and had to read through lots of waffle to get to the end. You start with ""here\'s the secret"", then go into some pointless Python which is never used to reveal the ""secret"", and then end with a fluff piece ""He wasn‚Äôt just managing the tyres; he was operating on a different level, neutralizing the degradation that was impacting the rest of the field"". You also go on to write ""a driver with the unique, data-proven skill to defy the normal laws of tyre wear"". This isn\'t an answer, it\'s PR and marketing.\n\nSo you\'ve started with the question - how was Sainz able to go 50 laps? You then do data analysis of his tyre wear and that of others, and say that using this data we can see his tire wear was less. The issue is: going 50 laps was proof of that itself. Him having better tire wear than others was obvious and self evident - it was they why and how that is interesting, and what I thought this article would answer. Instead, it fails to answer the question it set out for itself, and reads like a fan piece about Sainz with some pointless data analysis thrown in to make it seem more legit.\n\nHarsh feedback I know, but I\'ve gotta be honest.\n\nEdit: I\'ve got an example that might help get my point across better. Imagine there\'s a pizza eating contest and a Mr. Yamamoto eats 50 pizzas in an hour versus the 20 or 30 that his competitors eat. I then say I will use data and Python to reveal his secret of how he was able to eat more. I put together a Python script which shows that Mr. Yamamoto ate more pizza per minute than his competitors. I then conclude that he was better at eating pizza than his competitors. All I\'ve done is proven what was in the question - he ate more. My data is self evident due to the end outcome, and I\'ve given zero reason how he was able to eat more.', '""*It‚Äôs about physics, strategy, and a level of precision that can only be uncovered by looking at the data*."" but the article didn\'t really touch on any of this, other than the conclusion that Sainz was somehow neutralising a 0.084s/lap degradation. I was hoping for some suggestion on how this was possible based on the data.', 'Great article, here are a few notes, just my opinion:\n\n\\- Maybe open with a short factual basis? Who, when, what - before going into the social media buzz and whatnot. People forget fast, a bit of grounding helps. Maybe even a link for people who need more context.\n\n\\- Data cleaning: The outlap and inlap will be obvious outliers in this dataset, consider excluding them. Especially when you start calculating averages, it\'s quite bad if you average in inlaps with the normal laps.\n\n\\- Know your audience: I\'d assume most people reading a data breakdown are not there for the methodology, not there to read Python code. I think it\'s fine to link to source code but I wouldn\'t put the Python code in the article.\n\n\\- Balance of the article: To me, for a data focused article, it\'s a bit light on metrics calculated and explained, and a bit heavy on storytelling. ""an average driver was losing 0.084 seconds per lap to tyre wear"" - this is cool, but I don\'t necessarily need three sentences about you deciding to calculate this and I\'d love to hear more about what exactly this means, and what\'s this metric for Sainz specifically in comparison.', 'The article is ChatGPT-written slop.', 'As soon as somebody says ""using Python and data"" you have to know it\'s not worth reading lol', 'Thanks for the insight. Do you not understand Python?', 'That line is so obviously chatgpt', 'Thanks for the insight. Did you not find the plots and the comparison analysis understandable ? Since I‚Äôve tagged this post as technical and I‚Äôve been getting a bit of negative criticism from the people who probably do not understand Python and call it useless in some recent comments , I‚Äôm a bit confused as per what to do to generalise it more. I‚Äôm a person from a completely technical background , but I want to create content that makes sense to people who aren‚Äôt very technical as well. This is my first blog, but I‚Äôll try to generalise it better next time!', 'Totally agree with you here.  Whilst the article is interesting, the author should decide if the article is just a column or a full blown data research paper. This one is neither. \n\nAuthor described plotting lap times in detail (even included python script) but when it came to explaning ""modeling performance of other drivers"", we only got a short sentence with no explanation, and a meaningless number of 0.084s.  Without actually seeing the method and numbers, this approach is basically voodoo math. Calculating this ""powerful benchmark"" is nearly impossible - if it was this simple then no F1 teams would pay millions for their own strategy departments (either way, Ferrari would still get it wrong) \n\n There are tens or even thousands of siginificant factors that are difficult to accurately or even semi-accurately account for. Proclaming that Sainz P18-P10 is solely due to his smooth operation (or magically ignoring the tire wear) is misleading at best, and incorrect at worst.  I agree that Sainz drove a beautiful race. Instead of comparing Sainz to the whole field, it would perhaps be more accurate to compare him to Albon or Lawson as they both started on mediums and drove quite long stints in sort of similar environment. \n\nAgain, i applaud the author for writing this, and my comment is not a negative ""shut down"" in any way or form.', 'That‚Äôs such an amazing feedback, thank you so much!

And please take into consideration that I started watching F1 since 2023 mainly. 

However, to me, I feel like Fernando is an over-hyped driver. Of course, he has a sheer brilliance in terms of driving skills, but overall considering him, I feel like he gets more hype than he should be. 

He hasn‚Äôt had a single race win since 2012. Now a lot of people will blame his teams, but we‚Äôve seen drivers improving the whole team & the car. Schumacher did it, Hamilton did it as well. Red Bull developed their car around Max and turned him into a champion. Vettel also did it. However, I cannot see Fernando doing it ever. 

In 2023, he said the car feels a lot better and that car was developed mostly when Seb was in the team, not Alonso. By the end of 2023, the AMR23 couldn‚Äôt keep up with Ferrari & Mercedes. 

In his Ferrari days, the car was decent, however he still couldn‚Äôt overpower the surge of Red Bull and Seb, which is fair to me. In his 2nd time McLaren days, he couldn‚Äôt do much due to the car. In his first McLaren days, he couldn‚Äôt do much due to team preferring Lewis. However, we‚Äôre watching this season, Oscar is still on more points than Lando. 

So yeah, he did have some bad luck, maybe the worst luck as well. But the hype around him seems a little too much. Is he a great driver? Of course. Is he one of the best? In terms of skills, yes. 

However, just blaming on his luck constantly seems a little wrong. I would like to be proved wrong of course, and have a peaceful and constructive discussion.

Most casuals don‚Äôt appreciate him nearly enough because ‚Äúhe only has two titles‚Äù', 'One of the funniest things I\'ve seen regarding Alonso was Sam Collins from F1TV talking about him, I think in his first year at Aston.
