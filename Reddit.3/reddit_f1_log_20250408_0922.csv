Now Ralf Schumacher told Sky Deutschland that Doohan might be replaced by Colapinto as soon as the next race. If that‚Äôs the case and Alpine retained Colapinto next year, by then he would be a ‚Äúrookie‚Äù with a whopping 30-race experience. Many drivers have shorter career than that. Conversely, if Doohan managed to find a seat next year, he would not be considered ‚Äúrookie‚Äù despite having just 4-race experience simply because one of those races are the first race.

Is there an official definition of ‚Äúrookie‚Äù driver?

But, then it becomes the question of what about two races missed? Three? Five?\n\nHonestly, it's a designation that means absolutely nothing except being eligible for rookie records and rookie of the year. The only race important thing is the after 3 GP distinction for rookie practice sessions, which will have Bearman giving up his seat this week.\n\nI think it would be pretty laughable to call Colapinto a rookie if he has nearly a year and a half of races under his belt.

The Formula 1 rookie once again impressed in Japan. The Italian is getting closer and closer to George Russell, but also knows where he still needs to improve.\n\n> The hype was huge when Mercedes announced at the Italian Grand Prix in late summer 2024 that Andrea Kimi Antonelli would succeed superstar Lewis Hamilton. A few days earlier, the Italian had just turned 18. His crash during free practice at Monza involuntarily drew attention. The question arose: Does the rookie have what it takes to succeed in Formula 1?\n\n> Three races have now been completed in the still-young 2025 season. And Antonelli has already silenced the critics. The Mercedes rookie finished all three Grands Prix in the points. After fourth place in Melbourne and eighth in Shanghai, Antonelli crossed the finish line in sixth place in Suzuka (April 6th). That\'s 28 points. In addition, there are the two points from the China sprint, when the teenager finished seventh.\n\n> Antonelli has settled into fifth place in the drivers\' standings. Thanks to his more than solid results in the first few races, Mercedes is second in the constructors\' standings. The factory team is already 36 points behind leader McLaren, but Red Bull and Ferrari are easily keeping the Silver Arrows at bay.\n\n> **Leading laps in Suzuka.**\nThe weekend in Japan didn\'t start particularly well for Antonelli. While teammate George Russell was long considered the only driver who could potentially challenge the McLaren, Antonelli struggled with the conditions. The Bologna-born teenager still had to learn the challenging rollercoaster. He also struggled with tire management to perfectly warm up the sensitive Pirelli tires for a fast lap.\n\n> After reserve driver Valtteri Bottas gave the rookie a few tips, things suddenly flowed smoothly: sixth place in qualifying, just one position and two-tenths of a second behind Russell. Things went even better for Antonelli in the race. While his opponents stopped earlier than him, he was able to record the first lead laps of his Formula 1 career. ""When I had clear air, the pace really improved and I was able to extend my stint on the medium tires. That was a good feeling.""\n\n> Antonelli was able to take advantage of the fresh tires towards the end of the race, setting two records. The youngster needed just 1:30.965 minutes for his 50th lap ‚Äì no one in the race was able to beat that. Never before has a younger driver recorded a fastest lap and led a Grand Prix. World champion Max Verstappen was 6,803 days old in Barcelona in 2016. Antonelli was three days younger on race day in Japan when he achieved the feat.\nAntonelli is aware of his record: ""It was a nice feeling to lead the race for a few laps and to be the youngest driver in Formula 1 history to do so.""\n\n> **Russell as a benchmark.**\nThe development direction of the driver, described as a super talent, is in the right direction. But when will Antonelli first be on par with George Russell? He appears calm. ""I hope it will happen as soon as possible. But we also have to look at how strong George\'s start to the season has been. He already showed how good he is last year.""\n\n> According to Antonelli, part of the gap is also due to a lack of maturity: ""George always gets the most out of the car. I think that has to do with experience."" However, the challenger remains firmly convinced he can beat Russell at some point: ""The potential is there.""\n\n> **Student Antonelli.**\nSomeone who could give him tips on how to realize his potential at the pinnacle of motorsport is Valentino Rossi. Before the Japanese Grand Prix, Antonelli met up with his compatriot for a go-kart session. The nine-time motorcycle world champion shared some stories from his career. ""He told me a lot about his time. Now I want to go to MotoGP myself,"" the rookie beamed.\n\n> Before that, however, there are still Formula 1 races on the schedule. Antonelli also has to go to school for a few weeks. The final exam period is approaching. According to Mercedes, math is his particular problem area. He could ask his numerous engineers for some tutoring. The rookie is a great learner. He\'s already proven that in his short time as an F1 driver.', 'Calling it now Bearman vs Antonelli will be the next great rivalry in the 2030s.', 'After watching 3 race I starting to like him. Let how the season end.', 'Rookie just showed the potential of that Mercedes. Of course there was even more pace in it. Another opportunity wasted by Russell.', 'Seems inevitable.
