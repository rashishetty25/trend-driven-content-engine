This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

But how do you think or hope they will introduce this? \n\nSimilar to DRS with DRS detection points and zones? \n\nOr in a completely different way? \n\nCurious to hear your ideas!', '3 questions of the same type:\n\nIf Derek Warwick had signed for Williams in 1985 instead of staying at Renault, how do you think he would have done?\n\nIf Alesi had gone to Williams instead of Ferrari in 1991, what would he have achieved?\n\nIf Hill went to McLaren in 1998 instead of going to Jordan (or going in 1997 instead of going to Arrows), what would have happened?', 'Is there a maximum amount of fuel each team/driver gets to ""have"" available every race weekend?', 'An overtake button, like in Super Formula, would be super cool to see. I think it would make races even more engaging, as there is strategy involved in when to use up your overtake, instead of just passing other cars on a straight.', ""I'm out of the loop, what's the manual override mode?"", 'If Alesi goes to Williams then presumably Mansell does not. In that scenario he absolutely walks the 92 season similarly to Mansell. We know based on their respective comparison to Prost that Mansell and Alesi would probably be closely matched, with maybe an edge going to Mansell over a single lap.\n\n93 would be interesting for Alesi at Williams. Prost was weaker after his sabbatical, but maybe not by as much as some might suspect. Hill did a terrific job that year. I wonder how much Jean might have been mentally tested by having a quick rookie challenge (or even beat) him the year after winning a title.\n\nWas Hill at McLaren in 97 ever realistically going to happen? I always understood 98 was a better possibility. It really depends a lot on who he would’ve replaced. I think a competitive car would’ve brought the best out of Damon at that time. I thought his bad days in 96 when he made bad starts and sat behind slower cars were really just a result of tentativeness, an eagerness to avoid the mistakes of 95. With a WDC under his belt and the monkey off his back, I think we might have seen a much more authoritative but assured version of Damon. If so, he’d have had a good chance of winning the 98 title. I’d bet on him against Coulthard, with Mika we might have seen a 1986-style scenario where they take enough points from each other to let Schumacher in, but that’s if Damon is at his best.', ""Warwick's 85 season at Renault was not too hot. Would he have performed better in a quicker car? Possibly. But I still think he would've been chewed up and spat out by Rosberg in 85 just as Mansell was, maybe worse than Mansell was. \n\nI think Alesi would've done slightly better than Mansell in both 91 and 92, but not that much better. Both drivers were very similar calibre. Against Prost in 93 it would've been closer than in 91, but he would still lose the title assuming he inherits Hill's 4 mechanical failures in this hypothetical.\n\nIf Hill went to McLaren and replaced Coulthard in 1997 it would've been interesting. Though I don't think he was offered a contract until 1998, but for the sake of the hypothetical assuming he joins in 97, I think Hill would've beat Hakkinen in 97 and Hakkinen would've beat him in 98. It's possible that Schumacher would've taken the 98 title in that case, but tough to predict because Hill would've taken points off both of them."", 'Extra electric output allowance when closely following another car']",7,8,0.78,7,8,8,1,3,-0.020000000000000018,1
