1p3z3uc,Say something nice about each team,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p3z3uc/say_something_nice_about_each_team/,2025-11-22, Discussion,"Tell me what has impressed you most about every team this year. For me:

McLaren: They have give us a close driver battle for a lot of the year, plus the team seems to have absolutely nailed car development considering this is the final year of these regulations. 

Mercedes: They have been fairly consistent throughout the season and I don't recall any major strategy errors. It's this sort of consistency that makes them a powerhouse and kept someone like George Russell in the running for so long.

Red Bull: Outstanding resilience and Max's resurgence has been absolutely incredible to witness. There was of course the huge controversy and turbulence with the Horner fiasco, but the team seems to have moved past it fairly successfully and swiftly.

Ferrari: The team has always tried to do something different and make something of a difficult year. There have obviously been some serious issues, but I respect the team throwing the dice on some strategies. 

Williams: What an amazing demonstration of team evolution and new organisation can achieve! JV should be incredibly proud of what has happened and looks set to continue happening. 

Racing Bulls: Always in the shadow of the bigger sister team, but has been punching way above its weight. The one-lap pace has been awesome and there seems to be a lot of effort behind the scenes to train the newer drivers. 

Aston Martin: I think their investments into new personnel this year will see them have a similar resurgence to Williams in the coming years. They just need to be cut-throat and efficient to make it happen as soon as possible with the new regulations. 

Haas: For a team that is notoriously small and underfunded, they are achieving some excellent results (especially with Bearman) and doing all this with new drivers and personnel has shown how well the organisation is blending behind the scenes. 

Kick Sauber: Another team that has managed to punch above its weight by taking advantage of some chaotic moments and utilising unorthodox strategies. Nico's podium obviously being a standout moment! 

Alpine: After a turbulent start to the year with lots of controversy around driver changes, personnel changes, and what seemed like a lack of cohesion, the French outfit has shown some flashes of brilliance in the second half of the year when they get everything lined up. ","['All teams increased their profits.', 'Alpine is from France, and France has the Eiffel Tower. That’s kinda nice', ""Blessed Haas using that Ferrari engine to make even\xa0jenson ' the human sybian' button a bit envious of their ability to randomly out qualify Ferrari\xa0"", 'Red Bull: Got rid of Horny Spice', 'You know ferrari is cooked when the only good thing you can say about them is their strategy', 'Aston Martin is green', 'This is a nice vibe haha. \n\nMcLaren: They\'ve grown as a team from a ""I can\'t believe we\'re here!"" to more of a ""we\'re here now"" mindset, even though it\'s not always perfect.\n\nFerrari: They still have a great driver lineup with great style. \n\nMerc: they\'ve evened the ship a bit, and have been consistently present as a team.\n\nRed Bull: Got rid of Horner, and I genuinely like Mekies\' approach. Seems like they have kept their hyper focus on performance while lowering the volume on the less healthy drama. \n\nAston: I genuinely like what the team has invested in and brought to the sport. It hasn\'t translated on track so much, but Stroll Sr. has taken a team that would otherwise be at the back of the grid and given it a platform to fight from. \n\nAlpine: I find them the hardest to find something to cheer for/positive about. But I appreciate that their drivers and trackside crew still shows up and gives their all, despite all the turbulence. \n\nRB: Conversations about whether there should still be a second red bull team on the grid aside, it\'s hard to argue the impact that the team has on bringing young drivers to the grid. Even though it doesn\'t directly result in RBR driver performance, the system works great to bring career F1 drivers in. \n\nHaas: Komatsu has made me actually love this team. It seems like a healthy group with finally the financial platform and infrastructure with Toyota to move forward rather than tread water.\n\nSauber: Similar to Haas, the transition to Audi and to Wheatley\'s leadership (+ Binotto in his role, too) has made this team look so, so much better. It\'s great to see. \n\nWilliams: Obviously, lots positive to say. But I love the systemic steps forward the team is taking. There\'s still work to be done, but it\'s satisfying to see it start to pay off.', ""Red Bull - They brought a lot of young talent to the Sport\n\nMcLaren - Turned around a downward trend noone would have expected\n\nMercedes - Their engines have been among, if not the best, for three decades now\n\nWilliams - What not too long ago looked like a headless chicken is now a rising Phoenix\n\nSauber - They will always be the greatest privateer of modern Formula 1 for me\n\nRacing Bulls - I liked how they kept most of the Minardi staff after the takeover, so these guys could witness some deserved success \n\nAston Martin - Their car sports my favorite color and they have Nando, that'll have to do for now\n\nHaas - They got rid of Steiner and seem to have actual ambitions now\n\nAlpine - Their Livery looks nice, I guess\n\nFerrari - Red car goes wroom (most of the time)"", 'Alpine: the best worst team in history\xa0']",24,55,0.62,24,52,52,5,5,0.010000000000000009,5

I understand there is some history there, but surely it's not less safe than the horrible grip and close walls at Vegas?

In a comparable permanent race facility like Silverstone, we just keep racing in the rain as well.

Why are we so extra cautious in Spa?","[""90% of the time it isn't because of the rain, but because of poor visibility for the medical helicopter.

One driver hitting the barriers will be okay 99% of the time, but that same driver being hit by another car who can’t see them is likely to cause major injury, furthermore F1 has strict guidelines surrounding the medical helicopter as it requires good enough conditions to fly and land safely.\n\nIn Vegas today visibility was fine. The rain itself wasn’t all that heavy, and the track wasn’t even all that wet so the spray from the cars wasn’t overly aggressive, it was just super slick tarmac on it’s own which combined with the cold temps turned the track into a skating rink\n\nIn spa when it rains, it’s big thick rain that comes down in buckets, only to get kicked back up into the air by the cars. Watch an onboard from a wet spa race, or any other wet race that has been red flagged and you will see how little the drivers are looking at when following other cars.

At a track like Spa with a lot of high speed corners and elevation changes that makes the visibility problem even worse in some sections where the drivers can't see other cars until they're very close."", 'A comment I haven’t seen is that Spa is also the longest lap on the calendar.

V12's have more cylinders, but V10's go higher in rpm's. They all have different characteristics in how they sound. 

Plus, just an additional question: which is louder, the big 3.5 liter 15,000 rpm V12 or Ferrari's 3 liter 17,000 rpm V12, that is the last V12 in F1 ever and is still the highest revving V12 ever made?","['Found this on YouTube. \n\nMy opinion is that they’re roughly the same but the v10 hits a note higher than the v12 which pierces the ears.', 'I’d say the V12 definitely has a more hammering sound in which you can almost hear every single piston rev, with the straight cut gears of that era coming into play to create a very metallic and almost “gruesome” tone if it makes sense.\n\nThe V10 creates a much smoother high-pitched scream in which everything nicely blends together to create a well coordinated orchestra that almost resembles a jet engine rather than a combustion powered car.\n\nIt might be completely subjective, but the V12 **screams** a lot louder and forces you to cover your ears no matter what. The V10 is pure symphony, although still _extremely_ loud, and will not make the bones in your cranium tremble as much.', ""I'd say the V10s just because they continued developing those for more than a decade after the last V12 retired so they ended up revving way higher and making more power."", 'A 125 bike with a black widow', 'Why?

Watching now, when it was raining could only see one from one of the onboard cams, think Alonso's when he went off), anyway, is it just me or has Australia, Silverstone, and now Vegas seemed really sketchy for visibility this year and do you think they need to make changes to help these blokes we love to watch, um, not crash into each other by accident?
