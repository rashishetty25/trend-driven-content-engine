At timestamp 0:25, Jolyon says that it's McLaren's decision whether they can set up their garage at the end of the pit lane or at the start, as they are the Constructors champions.

How does a team decide whether they need it at the start or the end of the pit lane?

What factors are taken into account to make this decision? (time lost during pits, the width of the pit straight, etc)

And there have been instances where a team has gone against the normal scenario (eg, a track which traditionally has Constructors from the pit lane start, decided to be at the pit lane end in a particular year)","[""Yes it's true. Red Bull would pretty much always choose the start of the pit lane when they were WCC, for example."", 'They might prefer an unobstructed exit from the box (end of the pit lane) or an unobstructed entrance to the pit box (beginning of the pit lane)', ""During the Japanese GP, Julien Fébreau, who is the main French commentator for Formula 1 on Canal+, said the order was determined not only by the previous year's WCC, but also depending on where the paddock entrance is."", 'From a tight race perspective, let’s say Max is 2.5 seconds ahead of Lewis.  He comes in to pit and Lewis follows at that same gap.  Maxs stop takes 2.6s, Lewis comes by and he is held up, however briefly by another car coming in to pit.  \n\nThere are even some circuits which have wider pit exits so you can go almost side by side to eliminate the possibility of having an unsafe release. \n\n\nAs such wouldn’t it always be better to be at the end of the pit exit?', 'Following is a comment I made in an a thread about three weeks ago:\n\nI couldn\'t find a good answer to how they choose garage order. This whole ""WCC team choosing garage"" thing seems like something that is repeated without any actual evidence – and I\'ve just gone along with that without giving it any extra thought. I couldn\'t find anything specific in the rulebook either.\n\nBelow are two sources I found saying something about the order, though nothing about anyone\'s choice.\n\n>The position of each team’s garage in the pit lane is also determined by its finishing position in the previous season’s Constructors’ Championship. The champions work out of the space nearest the pit lane entrance, running down the order to the team who finishes last, who have the garages nearest the pit exit.\n\nhttps://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/the-beginners-guide-to-the-f1-constructors-championship.66nTfWSqrUYv3bnbosPkHV\n\n>Garage positions in the pit lane are assigned based on the team finish order in the constructors\' championship from the previous season.

Yuki would obviously be favored if he can get comfortable with his car but based on Perez and Lawson's experience I'm having trouble believing he can.  An argument could be made for Sainz, Alonzo and Gasly, I suppose, based on driver quality and experience.  Not looking great so far, though.

1juilz6,Concept Convergence: The one thing that is not being brought up in the “difficult to overtake” conversations this season,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1juilz6/concept_convergence_the_one_thing_that_is_not/,2025-04-08, Discussion,"In Adrian Newey’s 2017 autobiography, “How to build a car”, Newey brings up how the 2016 grid was almost a monolith, and how the racing became less exciting because “all cars looked the same”. He cites “concept convergence” as at times inevitable, but also a sign of a bad cycle of regulations. This has been the persistent problem of the post-2023 regs and why overtaking has been so difficult this season. The cars are the most identical they have been, and that’s a problem.

Some things that I noticed when browsing about discussions as to why the Japanese Grand Prix was a parade, is that people bring up the usual suspects of weight, dirty air by outwash, tyres lasting too long, and the cars just being too large in general. While dirty air will always be a contributor to bad racing, it is important to remember that the first half of 2022 had some of the best racing we’ve ever seen, with cars being the same size they are now, and the heaviest they’ve ever been (the 2022 cars are F1s all time heaviest cars), with tyres lasting much longer than they do now as well.

The reason why the first half of 2022 had exciting racing was plainly and simply, concept divergence. We had three functional concepts: The Red Bull downward sloping sidepod concept, the Merc “zero-pod” or “hide-pod” concept, and the Ferrari Bathtub concept. The Red Bull had great straight-line speed, the Ferrari was great in high-speed corners, the Merc was great in the low-speed corners and in tyre preservation. However, with TD39, and the 2023 floor edge regulations, everything changed.

By mid-2023, Ferrari abandoned the bathtubs, and Merc also joined the Red Bull concept in 2024. The cars more or less look the same now, and while some cars have different qualities than others (McLaren having a high-speed corner advantage last season and a tyre advantage this season), the characteristics of the cars are broadly the same, and the field spread is the lowest it has ever been. This, understandably, makes overtaking difficult, even with DRS. In 2021, while dirty air was still a problem, concept divergence was very strong with three different concepts pioneered by the three major engine manufacturers. Different cars still had different driving characteristics (like the Red Bull high rake concept vs the Merc low rake concept), while having roughly the same pace. This is not the case this season, as the variance in driving characteristics is extremely low.

In conclusion, this regulatory cycle has run its course, and the racing is not going to get any better. Hopefully, the 2026 regs allow for more concept divergence, which in turn will improve the product we see on track. While dirty air, weight, and the size of cars contribute to bad racing, concept convergence is the death knell for a regulatory cycle and what signifies the need for change. I am curious to know if anyone else had any thoughts on this. Thanks for reading.","['>In 2021, while dirty air was still a problem, concept divergence was very strong\n\n...and overtaking was still difficult, so...', 'Spec series literally have identical cars and still far more overtakes than F1. If anything, the smaller the difference between cars is the closer the racing is.', 'Spec series has the best racing though, so all teams being very similar would be ideal.', ""This is a bastardization of what Newey said, and doesn't make much sense from any perspective you look at it. \n\nDo you know what season had better racing than the first half of 2022? 2024. This was because the cars were much closer in performance to each other than at any other times in theses regs. 2022 was more exciting from a car development perspective, because of the concepts being different. In addition, there's something to be said about cars being better in quali or in the race making things more exciting. However, it doesn't make sense to say the racing is not going to get any better this year, after three races, and it really doesn't make sense to blame concept convergence for the poor race in Japan. \n\nIf you looked at the first couple races of 2024, you would have thought we were going to be in for a terrible season. If we followed your hypothesis, it would have been. But we had a genuinely good year of racing overall, with lots of tight battles. \n\nThis year, we've had a fantastic race and a couple of boring ones, what is looking to be a genuine title fight, and four cars within three tenths in both quali and race pace on most circuits. It's very hard to predict, but there is no reason to think this will be a bad year."", 'The issue is mainly the change to the floor edge in 2023. Raising this was done to remove porpoising but ended up forcing teams to try and seal the floor with a bunch of complex structures that created tons of outwash and vorticities.', 'Yeah I don’t think this is the issue, this wouldn’t account for 10 car DRS trains when the guy in front is so much slower than the cars behind but he still can’t be overtaken. The biggest issue is aero wash and the second biggest issue is the size of the cars.', 'I think design convergence and performance convergence can be separately analysed. One thing I really liked about 2022 ground effect regulations is that we had three distinct designs from the top 3 teams - Red Bull Racing, Mercedes, and Ferrari (as you mentioned). With time as teams saw performance benefits in one design over the other (Mercedes abandoning zero sidepods), and teams running into FIA TDs (Ferrari with flexi floor) we eventually see everyone settling into more or less a similar design concept. It just happens to be that McLaren have nailed all the critical parts - suspension geometry as well as sidepods and floor design. It’s not a coincidence that eventually all cars start to look alike as we get closer to end of current regulations. \n\nNow on the difficulty in overtaking part, it’s more about teams being closer to one another than ever before (qualifying gaps are a good indicator of just how close the field is) in terms of *performance*, since more or less every team now has a good understanding of current regulations. In Suzuka, Pirelli having an oversight in expected tyre deg due to track resurfacing led them to use same compounds instead of going a step softer which would’ve produced better racing. \n\n2026 regulations are shaping up to be similar to start of turbo-hybrid era in 2014 i.e. [a power unit formula](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/big-chance-f1-2026-is-engine-formula-adrian-newey/).

Seeing the teams create Japanese culture themed liveries, helmets, and promotional materials last week I realised I've seen virtually nothing of Tsunoda fandom from a Japanese perspective.  

I might be stereotyping here, but are there manga, anime, magazines, games, technology, food products, endorsements etc that we don't really see outside Japan?

I was a big fan of the Initial D series as it was being produced and there was a lot of hype around Keiichi Tsuchiya and the drift driving on hill climbs etc that seemed to produce a lot of fandom and commercial spin offs.  I'd imagine that there'd be something of that surrounding Yuki Tsunoda in Japan?

Please share anything in the comments!","[""In terms of mass media/sponsor stuff, every now and then there's some Red Bull promo here (like buy two cans, get a pin badge with Yuki's helmet/car on it), and I'll sometimes see someone wearing a VCARB cap, but that's about it in terms of seeing him in the wild here. I haven't seen him on any random endorsement ads or anything.  \nMaybe that'll change now he's in Red Bull, but I'd be surprised unless he sees some success there."", 'I am only speaking based on my experience in Japan over the last 3 weeks…\n\nBefore the Grand Prix, as I met and spoke with Japanese people in Tokyo they were largely unaware the Grand Prix was on, didn’t know Yuki but were like “oh ya, car racing. That’s cool”. Couldn’t find merch or anything in Tokyo, but sugar free red bull has Yuki on it here.\n\nThen, when I went to the Grand Prix, I would say the overwhelming team support I saw was for Red Bull and Racing Bulls and almost even split between Max and Yuki. Some of the Yuki merch the fans were wearing was a few years old, so unlikely driven by the recent news. They were probably supporting throughout his career. Also, obviously, some really cool fan made outfits supporting Yuki. There was also a Yuki themed gachapon in one of the shops. But outside of that, just saw the type of merch you would see at any Grand Prix, I didn’t see anything uniquely different for Yuki. There was a nice photo “alley” of his journey to F1 showing photos from when he first starting karting and then most of his Grand Prix starts.\n\nI spoke to some younger (than me) Japanese fans on the trains to and from (mostly early to mid twenties) and they were supporting Yuki this year and were fans of some of Hirakawa and Iwasa, but said they were larger fans of other drivers and before this year who would have supporting Ferrari or Aston Martin. \n\nI’m still in Japan for a couple more weeks, so if there are things I have missed, please let me know as I would LOVE to buy some Yuki merch whilst here, but compare to Melbourne, which I also attended, not close to same level of support Oscar had where he was voicing tram stops, the Grill’d dedicated burger/meal, murals, he was selling everything in all the OOH ads.', ""I dont know about how big the fandom is but I do know that when he moved to red bull there was ZERO coverage from the biggest japanese news sites like asahi shimbun or nhk, so I dont think he's known by general public in japan\n\n\nEdit: also I looked up his japanese name on twitter the day or two after he went to red bull and it was staggeringly quiet, no one outside motorsport circle was talking about it at all\xa0"", 'I was in Japan last year and Yuki did some kind of popup store, meet and greet thing. I wish I had gone because I guess it wasn’t hard to reach him, if that tells you anything.', 'They talk about him, sure, but Japanese motorsport has been in a ""crisis"" for some time now due to dwindling interest and attendance numbers. People who know him are likely fans of Japanese motorsports too like Super GT or Super Formula and not really the casual person on the street.\n\nLast year Yuki had a karting exhibition event together with some Super Formula drivers like Toshiki Oyu. But domestic motorsports don\'t seem to use his image that much. Japanese F4, where he started his career, doesn\'t take much advantage either except for a few mentions here and there (that might change though as the 2025 season is about to start soon)', 'I‘m currently in Japan for the First time. He’s on Red Bull cans if that helps', ""I logged onto GranTurismo 7 the other day and there's this option that allows players to share custom liveries for the cars. The closest thing to F1 cars in the game is the super formula car.

For example you may have 3 drivers, one is a street circuit specialist, one is great at qualifying and one great at pure racecraft. 

The qualifying expert will come in for races like Suzuka, your street expert can do your Monaco and Baku races and your other driver does places like Silverstone. Or you simply have a driver come in who historically does very well at a certain track. 

None of the drivers would win the drivers championship but is this not increasing the teams chances of getting more points and therefore more money from the constructors championship? Or is this simply just not traditional enough for them to even consider?

EDIT - based on the first few comments people can’t get the drivers championship out of their heads. 

This is all about the constructors. Imagine a team like Williams (for example) rotating drivers and picking up more points. Every place higher in the constructors is worth millions and their drivers aren’t going to win the drivers championship anyway.
