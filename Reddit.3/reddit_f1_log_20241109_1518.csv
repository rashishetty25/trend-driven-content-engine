1gmnca2,[Tobi Gruner] According to our information Qatars souvereign wealth fund is set to buy a minority stake in the Audi F1 team. Talks have been ongoing for months. Audi won't give up control of the team but get fresh money for investments in Hinwil.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gmnca2/tobi_gruner_according_to_our_information_qatars/,2024-11-08, Social Media,,"['i’ve seen this path before.', 'You put in the oil money and then it becomes green, you see?', ""So soon we'll have a Saudi team (AM) and a Qatari team (Audi/Sauber)"", 'McLaren is already owned by Bahrain. The Middle East is chipping away at European brands. In ten years will Europeans have any teams left in the sports they created?', 'At least Audi has the common sense to not allow the Qatar lot to have any control of the team because that could be catastrophic', ""People making fun of RBR being just a sports drink brand, they'll soon be more European and closer to racing then actual car brands.\xa0"", 'This are good News tbh. Lets Not forget that mercs stake on their Team is only 33%.', '> Formula 1 is booming worldwide. Thanks to cost caps, growing interest from sponsors and increasing income from the sale of rights, the first teams are now operating profitably. Whereas it used to be necessary to invest millions in racing, it will soon be possible to earn real money with Formula 1.\n\n> One consequence of this is that the racing teams are increasing in value. Even small teams such as Haas or Toro Rosso are now valued at over a billion euros. And because this is an illustrious circle of teams that is not so easy to get into from the outside, the trend is even increasing.\n\n> Some racing teams have started to literally capitalize on the development and sell shares. In June 2023, for example, Alpine announced that it had sold 24% of the team to a group of investors including actor Ryan Reynolds, golfer Rory McIlroy, boxer Anthony Joshua and football stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce.\n\n> In mid-September, the British website “Sky” reported that the US investment companies HPS and Accel were planning to invest in the Aston Martin Formula 1 team. Between 20 and 25 percent of the shares are to change hands. The deal is expected to increase the valuation of the racing team to at least 1.8 billion euros.\n\n> And according to information from auto motor und sport, Audi is also on the verge of concluding a deal with an investor. The purchase of the Sauber racing team was only completed at the beginning of the year. However, because the value of the racing team has already risen considerably since the deal was concluded, Audi can now really cash in.\n\n> Rumor has it that a suitable partner has already been found. The Qatar sovereign wealth fund wants to acquire a minority stake in the new works team. The emirate already owns shares in Volkswagen and Porsche. Now the billionaire investor from the Middle East is investing its money in the premier class for the first time.\n\n> The fresh money is likely to be used by Audi to further expand the Hinwil site. Here, the increase in personnel and infrastructure has not yet been completed. The car manufacturer would therefore not have to draw on its own reserves as a result of the Qatar deal.\n\n> Audi itself did not want to confirm the sale of shares in its F1 racing team. When asked by auto motor und sport, the company merely stated: “We are not involved in speculation. The team is not for sale.” However, the sale of a minority share would not be ruled out.\n\n> Even if it is not clear how high the sold share is, Audi will certainly retain control and not allow itself to be talked into decisions. According to our information, the negotiations began some time ago and are not a reaction to the current economic situation.\n\n> Managing Director Gernot Döllner said back in September at the race in Monza that the team’s involvement was not in question and was a long-term decision: “The decision was well prepared two and a half years ago and reassessed last year. We are firmly convinced that Formula 1 and Audi are a perfect match. It is in line with our strategy.”\n\n> The deal with Qatar could also be lucrative for Audi beyond the pure investment. The direct connection naturally opens up numerous opportunities at sponsor level. Qatar Airways is already active as a series partner in Formula 1. It is quite possible that the airline’s logos will soon be seen on the racing cars from Hinwil.\n\nTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)', 'Audi is already working on an exit strategy...Killing all VAG Motorsport programmes for this... Disappointing.', ""  \nThe important bit\n\n>Audi exit not a topic\n\n>Even if it is not clear how large the share sold is, Audi will certainly retain control and not allow itself to be talked into decisions.
