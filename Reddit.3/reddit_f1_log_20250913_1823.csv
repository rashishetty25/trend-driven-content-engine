He explains a lot about what he does and how he does it. Gives some really interesting backstory into how he first got in to working in F1 and who he learned from along the way. There’s some great stuff about learning from Murray Walker and also some interesting stuff about Martin Brundle when he was starting out. His love and respect for the sport is obvious also, he talks about Suzuka 2014 and how tricky reporting that weekend was.  
  
He’s a proper trained journalist so the way it’s written makes it an engaging read and not one I’m struggling through at all. If you like F1, Ted or both, can strongly recommend picking this up for yourself or for a Christmas present.

I'm a long time f1 fan, and enjoy learning about the technical side of things.

Which leads me to my question, in nature sharks have developed a sandpaper like texture to their skin which actually creates small vortices and reduces drag.
This has been replicated in high tech swimming costumes and even boat hulls.

Would this work with air rather than water?

I don't know if the principles of fluid dynamics translate to aero...

Imagine having localized areas of the car that reduce drag directing air to where it can be a benefit like the floor and wings etc...

Anyway, would love any input from anybody familiar with what I'm talking about
","['Shark skin textures reduce surface drag. \n\nSurface drag is not the primary limitation in F1’s aerodynamic performance. \n\nAnd the shark skin texture is not used in boat hulls. Bio fouling quickly ruins it. There’s a startup trying to sell cling film that claims to prevent bio fouling but basically all the early adopters have had to rip it off their hulls because it fouls up quickly.', ""Air is a fluid. Principles generally translate, but the scale and severity is different. Simple as that.\n\nWater generally gets treated as incompressible where air is compressible, so there are some differences there.

I absolutely love formula 1 and cars in general, and my dream is to one day become an F1 commentator.

My English is close to native level, and I’ve been told I have great diction. But due to the current gender conflict/polarizations in South Korea, I started questioning my dream. Would being a woman be a barrier if I try to pursue commentary in F1? Or are there any similar examples? I’d really appreciate your thoughts and advice.
