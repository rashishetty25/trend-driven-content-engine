I'm a long time f1 fan, and enjoy learning about the technical side of things.

Which leads me to my question, in nature sharks have developed a sandpaper like texture to their skin which actually creates small vortices and reduces drag.
This has been replicated in high tech swimming costumes and even boat hulls.

Would this work with air rather than water?

I don't know if the principles of fluid dynamics translate to aero...

Imagine having localized areas of the car that reduce drag directing air to where it can be a benefit like the floor and wings etc...

Anyway, would love any input from anybody familiar with what I'm talking about
","['Shark skin textures reduce surface drag. \n\nSurface drag is not the primary limitation in F1‚Äôs aerodynamic performance. \n\nAnd the shark skin texture is not used in boat hulls.

Principles generally translate, but the scale and severity is different.

Would being a woman be a barrier if I try to pursue commentary in F1? Or are there any similar examples? I‚Äôd really appreciate your thoughts and advice.
