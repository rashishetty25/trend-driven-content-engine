Hope you like it","[""I like your work, but I wanted to explain ideal laps for people who do not know. What an ideal lap time is is sticking all of their best sectors together across all their laps in a session.\n\nHowever, it very often isn't physically possible to do all these sectors at the same time. A large reason that's easy to understand is ERS (energy reserve system) deployment. They get a boost in speed when they want. In one lap in a session, they might have used the ERS on sector one and had their fastest sector one then. On another lap, they might have deployed more of it in sector two, on another lap in sector 3. The sectors through a total lap are also affected by tire management through the lap, or how a corner is taken. Practice is for trying out a lot of different things. Someone might take the last corner of a sector in a way that's fast for the first sector but slower for the next sector on one lap, and on another lap, they might try it the other way, which gets a better second sector time."", 'Keep in mind for a quali run you’re probably overcooking your tires if you push too hard throughout all sectors.

Pushing hard for a purple Sector can easily result in overcooked tires by the time you get to Sector 3. This weekend in particular, teams are having trouble (as of FP1) figuring out how to get the most of the new C6 over the full duration of a lap, so we’re seeing a lot drivers set purples in one sector with yellows in the next sector.

1komfkl,[AMuS] Who will finish second behind McLaren?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1komfkl/amus_who_will_finish_second_behind_mclaren/,2025-05-17, News,,"['Too early to tell, but Mercedes. Ferrari is Ferrari, and Red Bull is a one-man team.', 'Translation:\n\n> **McLaren proved to be vastly superior on the first day of practice at Imola. Over one lap and over the entire race. The only question now is: Who will finish second? Ferrari has the best chances in the long run, but they\'re one lap behind.**\n\n> After McLaren\'s one-two victory at the Miami GP, everyone was wondering: Could it be even more dominant? It could be, if the first day of practice in Imola were to be the benchmark for the rest of the weekend. This time, the McLarens had the better of the competition, even on one lap, with a lead of almost three-tenths. In the long run, that\'s for sure. There\'s a world of difference between McLaren and the rest.\n\n> The race for victory will be between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. Piastri beat his teammate by 0.025 seconds on one lap. In the race simulation, Norris had the edge by 0.045 seconds. However, Piastri completed two more laps on the medium tires. The close race between the Papaya Boys could be quite exciting for spectators. Perhaps less so for the McLaren command bridge. Will the first clash, which McLaren boss Zak Brown says is inevitable, take place in Imola?\n\n> Things remain exciting behind McLaren as well. On one lap, Mercedes has a minimal lead over Red Bull and Ferrari. Things are different in the long runs, where Ferrari excelled. Charles Leclerc\'s lap times averaged just two-tenths of a second better than McLaren\'s. ""But that only helps us if we\'re ahead of our opponents on the starting grid,"" team principal Frédéric Vasseur told his team. Imola is a track with a built-in overtaking ban.\n\n> In the midfield, Alpine shone on one lap with the new C6 tire. Williams was stronger on the medium C5 compound. As a whole, you have to trust Williams more. Carlos Sainz\'s long run was over half a second faster per lap than Pierre Gasly\'s.\n\nSix things you need to know:\n\n> **1) Is McLaren unbeatable again?**\nThe first practice session ended with a one-two finish for McLaren. Oscar Piastri finished ahead of Lando Norris. But the lead over third-placed Carlos Sainz was razor-thin at 52 thousandths of a second. All were on the new C6 compound. The second practice session, on the medium tires, presented a similar picture: Norris ahead of Sainz, separated by only 0.040 seconds. There was still hope that McLaren would at least have to fight for pole position.\n\n> But on the soft tires, McLaren then unleashed a blast. Piastri and Norris were within just 0.025 seconds of each other. Everyone else, including Pierre Gasly at the front, was almost three-tenths behind. With a time difference of 1.127 seconds for the entire field, that\'s a class difference. Things got even worse for the rivals in the long runs. Only Ferrari was able to keep up. All the other drivers were on average half a second slower per lap. While the McLarens maintained their lap times consistently, their rivals\' times improved after five laps.\n\n> **2) Has Red Bull solved its problems?**\n\nYes and no. Even the Imola upgrade only partially cured the RB21\'s weaknesses. Max Verstappen initially reported understeer at the apex and oversteer on corner exit. But by the second practice session, the understeer had disappeared. ""Nevertheless, we lost four-tenths to the McLarens. That\'s too much. And in the race, the McLarens seem to be in a class of their own again,"" lamented Sporting Director Helmut Marko. Compared to the other teams, the assessment is cautious. ""We ran our normal program, but we have the feeling that some of them were perhaps a bit lighter.""\n\n> The latest development stage hasn\'t entirely failed to achieve its intended effect, but it hasn\'t brought Red Bull significantly closer to McLaren or away from its fellow sufferers Mercedes and Ferrari. Furthermore, the car bounces over bumps and curbs—a long-standing problem that has plagued Red Bull for two years now. Yuki Tsunoda\'s eighth-place finish was surprising, but even more so was the small time difference of 0.092 seconds. ""No one has been this close to Max in a long time. Yuki doesn\'t mind the oversteer as much. He complains less,"" Marko noted. The small time difference could also tell a different story, however. Namely, that Verstappen wasn\'t yet at his best. The world champion usually strikes when things get serious.\n\n(1/2)', 'Qualifying pace is too tight to say McLaren will definitely win', '""Most competitive season yet""', 'Ferrari but i will get attacked again for saying it so whatever, i look at data provided.', '***Reaaaalllly*** interesting and helpful article. Thanks for the full translation!\n\nAnother interesting aspect, echoing recent races, is the apparently much better traction off the line from P2 on the grid. \n\nHave a look at the analysis by @lowerlaptime aka Martin on YT. \n\nThe C6 and the performances to date by Carlos and Pierre open up hope for their teams and the possibility of some teams going for a two-stop strategy.', ""McLaren often turns up the engine on Fridays, and doesn't maximize the results in Q3 where it matters the most\n\nSo pole and Victory are still for grabs here"", '> **3) Where do Mercedes and Ferrari stand?**\nNeither is a contender for victory. George Russell was four-tenths of a second behind McLaren\'s fastest time in his fast laps on both tire compounds – soft and medium. Andrea Kimi Antonelli wasn\'t really getting into his stride in his one-lap home race. The Mercedes rookie was hiding in 13th and 18th place. Mercedes focused on long runs on the first day of practice, hoping to improve its performance on Sunday. But the Silver Arrows\' long runs were no revelation either. Antonelli performed better here, averaging 1:20.334 minutes. Russell managed only 1:20.675 minutes.\n\n> Ferrari was even slower than Mercedes on one lap, but only slightly. Charles Leclerc lost 0.075 seconds to Russell. Lewis Hamilton only achieved his lap time on his second attempt. On the first, he encountered traffic. Franco Colapinto engaged in a pointless duel with the world champion and fought back against the Ferrari driver even with the DRS open. The Ferrari drivers\' long runs were encouraging. They were the only ones to come close to the McLaren endurance runs. Charles Leclerc completed six laps at an average of 1:20.188 minutes. Hamilton was three-tenths slower. Vasseur is no longer even considering the McLarens: ""In the group behind, it\'s all about hundredths. Our long runs were good, but they only help us if we\'re ahead of the others at the start.""\n\n> **4) Can Gasly spoil the favorites’ fun?**\nPierre Gasly came closest to the McLaren drivers, with one lap remaining. It appears that the mostly slow corners suit the Alpine. Alpine\'s best race to date came in Bahrain, a track with similar corners. Gasly exulted: ""The car felt good from the first lap. We\'ve resolved some of the question marks that have plagued us in recent races. The car now responds the way I want it to."" After a collision with a hare, the number 10 car had to be repaired between the two practice sessions. The front wing and underbody sustained damage. In the long run, however, Alpine lagged behind. Gasly was the slowest in the field with an average of 1:21.007 minutes. However, he also completed the longest distance with eleven laps.\n\n> The Williams drivers performed much better, even though they ultimately only finished 9th and 10th. Carlos Sainz and Alexander Albon praised the car\'s balance, but are still puzzled as to why the soft tire didn\'t work as well for them in the second practice session as it did in the first. And why, on one lap, they were practically on par with the McLarens on the medium rubber. Sainz therefore demands: ""We have to understand why we couldn\'t get the most out of the C6 tire in the afternoon. The starting grid is crucial here.""\n\n> **5) Which Aston Martin is faster: old or new?**\nShort answer: The difference in lap times is zero. Lance Stroll drove the AMR25 with the new parts, while Fernando Alonso drove the old specification. Aston Martin will decide this evening which version both drivers will continue to use starting Saturday. The result was devastating. Alonso was 0.121 seconds faster on medium tires than Stroll on soft tires. However, Alonso set his lap time 20 minutes later on a faster track.\n\n> Of all the teams, Aston Martin brought the biggest upgrade to Imola: The entire underbody, from the Venturi ducts to the diffuser, the engine cover, the beam wing, and the halo fairing, were all new. Team principal Andy Cowell emphasized that lap times weren\'t the main focus on the first day of practice. The first goal was to find out whether the new wind tunnel would deliver reliable results and whether the conclusions the engineers had drawn from this data were putting them on the right path. Apparently, they\'re still in a maze. Even if things looked a bit more favorable for Stroll in the long run.\n\n> **6) Does Pirelli\'s C6 superglue hold?**\nPirelli\'s new C6 tire had only been tested twice before: last year in Mexico and Abu Dhabi. Therefore, even Pirelli was curious to see how the new super glue would perform in real-life conditions. The results were positive. The softest tire compound provided grip throughout the entire lap and didn\'t break down in the final sector. Compared to the C5 tire, the times were seven-tenths faster.\n\n> However, the track had improved in the meantime thanks to more rubber. The actual difference is four tenths. That\'s more than Pirelli had expected. They were predicting two to three tenths. Ferrari team principal Vasseur praised the result: ""The C6 tire actually lasts six to seven laps. But that\'s not enough for a race."" Anyone who wants to use the soft tire at the start is committing to a two-stop race from the start. And they\'ll fall deep into the field because no gaps have opened up by that point.\n\n(2/2)', 'Hahahha NO']",8,10,0.72,8,9,9,8,10,0.72,8
