It’s not like Mercedes got caught out by any of those 2022 era regulations.   \nWell, except that whole ill-fated zeropod experiment.

We see when there's unique circumstances they often have the fastest car so it does work very well in the right conditions, it's just that they can't convert that into how the car behaves around 90% of tracks.\n\nAlso, previous regs they had an engine advantage and could outspend everyone.

It’s always been a matter that there’s more to a F1 car then an engine and as you know, Mercedes has had rookie seated for this year who’s had a roster of bad performances so no need to act like Mercedes has just been notably outperformed by McLaren while being on the same playing field and have an equally good car', '🤚🏻\xa0']",0,13,0.41,0,103,103,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
