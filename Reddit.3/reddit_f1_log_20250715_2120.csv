* cheek (italian ce)
* creek (thanks u/TheKennyAlmighty )

Interesting podcast with Tim Mayer whose standing for the presidency of the FIA. Really interesting to hear his opinions on so many elements of our sport as he sets out his pitch for president. ","['>he sets out his pitch for president\n\nAnd that is really what this is all about: marketing. This is all about Mayer making a pitch to the public about his candidacy, and the interviewer does not challenge on anything or ask any follow-up questions. For instance, Mayer says ""there was the World Councils, World Motorsport Council, the World Mobility Council and those two have been seriously impacted by the current administration"" -- but he does not explain *how* those councils have been affected or what he will do to address that problem. He just says that they have been, and then immediately contradicts himself by talking about how ben Sulayem has been supporting smaller federations and how he himself agrees with this policy.\n\nThen Mayer goes on to talk about the non-disclosure agreements. He says that anyone who breaks it can be fined 50,000 Euros and the FIA do not need to prove that you broke the agreement to issue the fine. So how do they know how to fine? It seems that the implication here is that the FIA will go around fining people left, right and centre, but there has been no evidence of that and the interviewer does not ask him to explain this statement. The only way they could fine you is if you made public statements about the thing you agreed not to discuss, which would make it a slam dunk.\n\nFinally, the interviewer does not challenge Mayer over his actions in Austin where he was advising the event organisers on how to appeal their penalty for the track invasion. Since he was in a senior role in the FIA at the time, this was a massive conflict of interests -- and worse, his actions put the FIA in legal jeopardy. If civil or criminal action was brought in the aftermath of the invasion, and Mayer successfully got the penalty reworded to exonerate the organisers for their failings in a key area of responsibility, then it would effectively say that the FIA allowed the invasion to happen.\n\nThis is not an interview, This is propaganda. Mayer screwed up and lost his job, and is pissed about it so he is running for FIA President. And because ben Sulayem is unpopular, he has found a platform where he is allowed to make broad, sweeping statements that are completely shallow, and he allowed to make them without any critical questioning of his policies.', ""F1's dedicated down-under fact checker is back on the case!"", ""I am not sure if you are being sarcastic. I will choose to believe that you are not.\n\nMy objection to this stems from the way everyone is so dissatisfied at ben Sulayem's leadership that they are taking any opportunity to convince themselves that his days are numbered -- but there are so many problems with Mayer as a candidate that those same people are just setting themselves up for disappointment."", 'Between Hitler and Bush, if you had to choose one, you would probably choose Bush, no?

I only started watching Formula 1 a few seasons ago because of the show. I still get excited and binge it as soon as it premiers.



That said, you need to take the show with a grain of salt. Some of the story lines are churched up for TV excitement. The biggest example that comes to mind from last season is Lando's first win at Miami. The show showed a frustrated Max, but in reality he was excited for Lando and gave us his famous ""If my mom had balls"" quote.","[""Redbull drama, Hulkenberg's podium, Ferrari doing Ferrari things, and manufactured McLaren driver squabbling.
