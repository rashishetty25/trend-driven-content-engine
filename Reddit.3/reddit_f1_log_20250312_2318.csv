This year, the draft reached a point where teams were faced with choosing either a rookie/young driver in a fast car (Lawson, Antonelli) or a veteran driver in a lesser car (Alonso, Sainz). Then it was down to a pool of veteran and rookie drivers in questionable cars (Hulk, Ocon, Gasly, Hadjar, Doohan, Bearman).

Wondering what you all thought would be a better strategy - rookie in a fast car or veteran in a (likely) slower car?","['If Lawson or Antonelli finished behind Alonso or Sainz it would be a major disappointment.

No. \n\nDTS highlights McLaren's mistakes for drama but all teams make them, they're not something you can 100% solve for. \n\nMy personal opinion is that McLaren knowingly went for the constructors and removing 'papaya rules' when they did was just a bonus round if anything.

With that though i reckon reserve pilots will just jump on the car so the event will not be canceled, but that won't have the same appeal and thus venues risk of selling less tickets, also i have no idea if all the teams are able to call in 2 pilots
