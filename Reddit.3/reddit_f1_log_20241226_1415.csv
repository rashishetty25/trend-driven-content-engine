1hmkuul,Trip to Modena and Maranello,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hmkuul/trip_to_modena_and_maranello/,2024-12-26, Discussion,"Hello, 
My wife and I are planning a trip to the Modena and Maranello museums soon. I know there have been many posts about visiting these museums, but I‚Äôm unsure how up-to-date the information is, and I still have a few questions.

1. How do we get from Modena to Maranello and back? We‚Äôll be traveling by train from Bologna to Modena and back. I‚Äôve seen that there‚Äôs a shuttle bus on the museum website, but the timetable seems a bit inconvenient. Are there any better options for getting between the two museums? And if there's a bus between them, how do we get the tickets?

2. Can we visit both museums in one day, or would you recommend dedicating a full day to each?

3. I read in another post that someone recommended taking a guide during the visit, but I didn‚Äôt see this option when booking tickets online. Is it possible to hire a guide on-site?

4. I‚Äôve never used a simulator before‚Äînot even on a PC. Would the F1 simulator experience still be worth it, or would it likely be frustrating since I‚Äôm a complete beginner?

5. Are there any must-visit spots near the museums? This could be anything‚Äîgreat places to eat, nice walking areas, or other attractions in the vicinity.

6. Are there any must-buy souvenirs from either museum, or are there better shops nearby?
Is photography allowed in the museums, and are there any specific spots that are particularly great for photos?

Sorry for so many questions. Thanks in advance for your advice and tips!","['I did both this year in August.\n\n1.\tWe had a car so I can‚Äôt talk about transit unfortunately, we parked at Fiorano and got the coach in to Maranello. \n2.\tWe did both in the same day, it was just right, not too much to do at all. \n3.\tWe didn‚Äôt book a guide or feel like it was necessary. We did book tickets online beforehand. \n4.\tThe simulators are great and beginner friendly. Maranello has an F1 simulator, and Modena has a GT style one. The one in Modena is cheaper! \n5.\tWe just did these two, but if you get the coach in to the museum you can see Fiorano too. \n6.\tThe shops are very expensive, we didn‚Äôt buy anything there.', 'I didn‚Äôt visit Modena, but did go to Maranello and also took a bus tour around Maranello that goes into the production areas. \n\n2. A full day was not needed for me in Maranello museum. Couple hours personally. \n\n3. A guide wasn‚Äôt necessary to me‚Ä¶but would imagine it depends on the level of Ferrari you already know or care to know. \n\n4. I passed on this, it was something like an additional 30 USD for like 10 minutes. But I have a sim rig at home with arguably better hardware lol. Pretty confident they were running Assetto Corsa which is a standard available game, not some crazy secret proprietary software.  But still may be cool as it will allow your brain to see how fast some stuff comes at you. \n\n6. Photography was allowed and encouraged in Maranello. When I did the little bus through the campus tour it wasn‚Äôt allowed. I did not find the campus bus tour worth the extra money.', ""2. It depends how much time you'll spend there, but it took me about 1,5-2h to leasurly walk though the Museo in Maranello and have a close look at everything.\n\n  \n4. The simulators are fun, but very expensive. Obviously they are not real cockpits, but very roomy versions and you can chose your driving assist when you get in. So if you're unexperienced, you can still have a go. The chassis moves left and right underneath you to simulate the car movements, but personally I found it very distracting because - if i remember correctly - the screen didn't move.\n\n  \nJust have a great time there, usually there'll be interesting cars in the car park from other visitors"", ""There is a dedicated Ferrari bus from Modena's station to Maranello's museum.

My 2 cents: I did both museums in one day, it is feasible if you don‚Äôt read every single thing you find around.

You can visit Maranello, have lunch at Cavallino and move to Modena. I‚Äôm a long time fan and a bit of a mechanical engineering junkie, it was a blast: hope you‚Äôll have a great time!

Engines for example have been highly uniform. Everything has been very tightly homologated on that front since approx 1996 with the V10s, then after 2005 with the V8s and since 2014 with the hybrids. Those regs have included development freezes too. Compare that to the immediate post-turbo environment where you had Ford V8s vs Renault V10s and Ferrari & Honda V12s and it feels like a completely different sport, a Wild West version of F1.\n\nThen we have the circuits - Tilkedromes have basically been a constant since approx mid 2000s and the only real difference is they aren‚Äôt universally thought of as bad for the sport today. We‚Äôve had more street circuits recently though and I like the variety they provide. Along with the circuits we have had the global expansion of the sport going back to 2004 with the introduction of Bahrain and China. Before then, F1 was basically a championship of Europe, a little bit of the Americas with Japan and Australia tacked on.\n\nIn-season testing also just hasn‚Äôt been much of a thing in our time. Gone is the unlimited Ferrari running around Fiorano. There‚Äôs probably far more I‚Äôm missing - I didn‚Äôt mention how bulletproof the cars seem in comparison to the 1990s, but I definitely feel like the F1 of circa 2001 has far more in common with today‚Äôs F1 than it does with the sport of ten years prior.', ""that's really funny! reminds me the stat that hamilton verstappen hold record for most 1-2 finishes. not sure what is the exact number, because that had some since [this article](https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1015574/1/alltime-joint-record-hamilton-and-verstappen-set) came out."", ""No official date.

But it‚Äôs not about reactions ‚Äì which is the physical asset which most obviously begins to decline with age.\n\n>We know this because there have been many tests done of F1 driver reactions ‚Äì and the outcome is completely normal; a range from fast to slow, just as in any control group of non-racing drivers. One of the greatest racing drivers of all time, Michael Schumacher, had notoriously poor reactions when measured.\n\n>‚ÄúAbout the same as mine,‚Äù related his then-boss Ross Brawn.

Reactions measure the response time of our central nervous system to a stimulus. Research conducted by defence contractor (and one-time Williams sponsor) QinetiQ to determine physical suitability of candidates for fighter pilot roles found that sensitivity to rotation and yaw (the very things a racing driver is using to feel and balance a car through a corner) came from receptors in our lower spine which pass messages sub-consciously (and therefore instantly, with zero delay) to our middle ear.\n\n>This would seem to suggest that the effectiveness of this neural pathway is what actually differentiates who can feel a car better than someone else and probably therefore how naturally quick they are.\n\nShame the people who only read headlines and smugly make conclusions will likely miss out on it."", '""So, another myth which needs to be put to bed: the ‚Äòfastest driver‚Äô.\n\nThere is hardly ever such thing as a definitive ‚Äòfastest driver‚Äô.

Some drivers have a wider skill set than others ‚Äì Fernando Alonso springs to mind.
