Some ideas-


Leclerc/Russell- both found race day form and consistency to match their qualifying pace 

Piastri- went from being a Number 2 to being something of a thorn in Norris's side

Norris- towards season's end, he seemed to learn from his mistakes and drove quite a few great races

Gasly- Regardless of whether or not he actually caused damage, a season that clean in the midfield is astounding, and he looked great at the end of the year

Tsunoda- looked calm, consistent, and fast, making 2021 a distant memory, and ensured he's kept in the Red Bull seat conversation, even if the top brass don't want him there

Any others I missed?

He showed he has the pace this year to take on the best.', ""Russell! Last year I was slandering him for consistent mistakes with crashes, but his craft improved dramatically, he's a lot more consistent, I feel like he's improved his tire management, and generally even his qualifying took a step up (thought that's perhaps Hamilton taking a step down)! Regardless I am a lot more impressed with Russell this season!"", ""I'd say Lando, not perfect by any means but had the hardest job on the grid of being judged against Max, who *is* near perfect. He improved in that regard exponentially, his qualifying and ability to handle pole pressure became perfect. And his ability to handle race leads and fights got much better at the end of the season and I'm glad what eventually won McLaren the championship was Lando needing to single handedly turn in a flawless performance under immense pressure. \n\nPiastri is quite a mad one, maybe he did improve but he actually went backwards compared to his teammate. So it's hard to quantify his level relevant to last season."", ""I'm going with Carlos. This is the first session I have really thought of him being a winner.

He won his first races and showed he could dominate when the car was good. Still inconsistent, but a very good season.\n\nI'd also say Sainz. Maybe he didn't improve much on paper.

1hdkfcc,How F1 employee bonuses work in the budget cap era,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hdkfcc/how_f1_employee_bonuses_work_in_the_budget_cap_era/,2024-12-13, Discussion,"McLaren can give 12mil to employees in bonuses and have it not count against the budget cap.

Most other teams can give 10mil.

Haas and any other team that finished higher this year than they did any of the previous three years can also give 12mil to their employees excluded from budget cap.

Edit: To do the math, assuming teams pay their full bonus, McLaren employees got a 20% increase in bonus compared to last year, and Red Bull employees got a 16.67% decrease. Now, teams might not choose to pay this much in bonuses. Individual teams might have goals they have to meet to get their bonuses by their individual employee contracts. Just like teams don't have to spend the whole budget cap in the first place. For instance, it might be in Red Bull's employee's contracts that they have to place top 3 in the WCC or no bonus at all. But they might have something much more lenient. Just like driver contracts, we don't know what are in employee contracts.

Quote from the regulations:

""Excluded Bonus Maximum Amount"" means:

(a) for each F1 Team that either wins the Constructors’ Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period, or achieves a higher finishing position in the Constructors’ Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period than it achieved in any of the previous three Reporting Periods, US Dollars 12,000,000; and

(b) for each other F1 Team, US Dollars 10,000,000""

I did not understand how any of this worked until looking up the regulations, and I don't think many people understand how it works either.

Would you like to end of third in the WCC because one of the drivers is bringing in enough money that the higher ups are still happy ? You've worked your whole life to end up here, but money talks more than performance. So you're not happy.

This must be bring down the morale of the whole team, and that means people leaving for greener pastures. The majority of people working at Red Bull want to _win_, not to make more money for the stakeholders and Checo's presence is working against that goal.

This might be a significant enough reason to drop him despite the money, especially since Red Bull has been losing engineers left and right since the new regs.
