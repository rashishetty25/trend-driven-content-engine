How good do we think it really was? Specifically, do we think Schumacher could have won the world championship in it?\n\nBefore having watched the mid 90s retrospectively, I thought Ferrari spent the period on a gradual upward curve and that 1995 was really quite similar to 1994 for them, but that really wasn’t the case at all. \n\nThe 94 car was generally third fastest throughout the year thanks to having the best engine in the sport. It was good at anything resembling a power circuit, a legit frontrunner at the Hockenheims and Monzas of the world, but a bit lacking at handling-dependent circuits like Monaco, Catalunya and Hungary, where the McLaren was clearly a better package.\n\nIn 95 Ferrari scored the same number of wins and podiums and only two points more than in 94, but watching the races tells an entirely different story. The 95 Ferrari was competitive virtually everywhere and could feasibly have won six races rather than just one. Berger led before a botched pit stop at Imola, Alesi led very early when he broke down at Spa, Monza they had a 1-2 before the camera catastrophe, at the Nurburgring Alesi had a 40 second lead but couldn’t hold on in the closing laps and then at Suzuka Alesi was fighting Schumacher for the lead when he suffered mechanical failure.\n\nObviously there were nuances with all five of the above races that put the Ferrari in a position to win (Schumacher and Hill colliding at Monza and the team getting the strategy bang on at the Nurburgring just two examples) and it is also probably fair to say Alesi had his best year in 95 but still it was shocking to me to find out how good the 95 Ferrari was. Schumacher never looked anything like winning six races in the 96 car so that says a lot. What do we think? How good was the 95 Ferrari really?', 'Thought this was nice.

Gabriel Bortoleto - Sauber

Jack Doohan - Alpine

1hefgfj,Breakaways series ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hefgfj/breakaways_series/,2024-12-14, Discussion,"In the past we’ve seen a lot of discussions about breakaway series, most recently 2009 if my memory serves. Given the way the FIA and more specifically MBS are going at the moment I don’t think it’s much longer before we see talk of another breakaway series again. F1 doesn’t need the FIA to survive but the FIA does need F1 to survive. Keen to hear others thoughts on this tbh","[""It wouldn't be able to be called F1 without the FIA"", '>F1 doesn’t need the FIA to survive\n\nF1 belongs to the FIA; the FOM just has a lease for the commercial rights. If FOM decided to break away, that would open a real can of worms of legal issues. \n\nFor starts, the name alone. They probably wouldn\'t be able to call themselves F1 anymore. Fine, let\'s imagine they come up with some new name like ""GP1"", ""GP World Series"", ""Formula X"", whatever. Basically, a whole new brand. Sponsors, race promoters etc might now say ""Hang on, we\'re paying to be in Formula 1, not some \'GP1\' series. We\'ll gladly get a new contract with you though, if we don\'t have to pay as much."" Income and, therefore, profit, suddenly drops massively. For *everyone* involved.\n\nYou may also have a problem with the cars. As F1 is owned by the FIA, so are the regulations. Would a new breakaway-series even be allowed to use the current F1 ruleset? Would they have to come up with one on their own? Probably the latter. But with potentially lower income, you\'d need to make sure things get a lot cheaper.\n\n>but the FIA does need F1 to survive\n\nThat\'s also a very bold take IMO. Yes, the FIA\'s own income would probably also shrink, but as a non-profit it doesn\'t have to constantly grow financially. There still are several other world championships under the FIA after all. Besides, they could also just make a new series called ""F1"". Arguably this wouldn\'t be as successful as the current one, not for a while at least, as likely most of the people involved would switch series. But even that isn\'t a given. Who knows, maybe some teams would rather stay with the actual FIA F1, hoping that their experience helps against any new teams in this new F1?\n\n\nGenerally speaking, as much criticism as the FIA (or rather MBS in particular) is getting, I think the importance of having a governing body whose main goal is not pure profit is sometimes underappreciated. Remember that Andretti\'s/Cadillac\'s entry originally was rejected *by FOM/F1 themselves*, while the FIA gladly welcomed them. An ever-growing calendar as well as sprint races - both ideas that aren\'t *hugely* popular with fans - also come from FOM/F1 rather than the FIA.', ""F1 does need the FIA as without the FIA there is literally no F1.\n\nThe FIA are the people who run the championship. Sure, Liberty could create some other similar series, but they'd have to figure out how to do everything themselves and would lose their world championship status, all their history and their brand which is why it's all bluffing and not a real threat."", 'Formula Juan', 'Una formula', 'The rising number one of Formula One, Juan.']",0,7,0.24,0,6,6,0,0,0.12,0
