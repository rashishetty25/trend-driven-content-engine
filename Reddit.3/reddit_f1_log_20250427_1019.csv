If I'm reading correctly the number one was assigned to the winning team since 1974 not necessarily the driver?

The newest regulations where a driver has a permanent number and the ability to use number one I believe went into effect in 2014 with Vettel. 

Individuals that I believe did not:
- ~~Damon Hill (moved from Williams)~~
- ~~Jacques Villeneuve (moved teams after winning)~~
- ~~Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen? With Ferrari assigning the number to Filipe Massa instead~~
- Nico Rosberg (retired)
- Lewis Hamilton chose to stick with #44 *but used it with McLaren*
- *Mansell (retired)*
- *Rindt (killed)*
- *Hawthorn (killed)*
