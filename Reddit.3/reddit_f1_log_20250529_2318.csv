1ky7p64,This is what 'Platinum' actually means for Max Verstappen,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ky7p64/this_is_what_platinum_actually_means_for_max/,2025-05-29, Discussion,"I see a lot of misconceptions about what this 'Platinum' thing means that Max Verstappen has since yesterday, so this is what it actually is.

Platinum is a *rating* from the FIA, it's not a *licence*. As a driver you request to be rated by the FIA, you do not ask to be given a specific rating. The FIA decides what rating you get. It's like a tool or a guide for racing organisations like the SRO (GT World Challenge etc.), so they know where to place this driver into a certain category (like Pro, Pro-Am etc.), depending also on the rating of the driver's teammates.

Being rated by the FIA does not ""bring Verstappen closer to competing in WEC and ELMS"", because it's not a licence. Being Platinum is not a requirement at all to race in those championships nor did Verstappen need to do anything extra to be given a rating apart from just asking for one.

Also, not all F1 drivers are Platinum-rated. As a driver you only ask to be rated, if you intent on doing sports car racing. Only 6 current F1 drivers (including Max) actually have a Platinum-rating: Alonso (WEC champion and Le Mans winner), Colapinto (ELMS race winner and Spa 24H competitor), Norris and Stroll (Rolex 24 at Daytona competitors), and H√ºlkenberg (Le Mans winner). Edit: I didn't wanna forget about Friday drivers Drugovich, Hirakawa and Vesti, who too have a rating.

Alongside the facts listed above, my personal expectation is Verstappen might try and do the KW 6h ADAC Ruhr-Pokal-Rennen, the sixth round of the N√ºrburgring Langstrecken Serie on August 16. He is definitely not doing WEC or ELMS.

Edit: you don't even technically need to ask to be rated, but it is very common to do. As somebody who's been working in the sports car racing industry for a while now, I've seen cases of drivers set to make their debut without having requested to be rated. The FIA will then scramble to find out who this driver is and what their career history is to rate them asap üòÖ","['I believe after you turn 50 the FIA takes away your platinum status.

1ky6yot,[AMuS] Excitement through new front wing checks,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ky6yot/amus_excitement_through_new_front_wing_checks/,2025-05-29, News,,"['I expect to be disappointed', ""*Preview of the 2025 Spanish GP*\n\nTranslation:\n\n> **The FIA \u200b\u200bhas announced stricter front wing checks for Barcelona. We'll reveal what this means in our Grand Prix preview.**\n\n> Many engineers have marked the Spanish Grand Prix in bold on their calendars this year. During the winter break, the FIA \u200b\u200bannounced that all teams would have to prepare for more rigorous front wing testing leading up to the Barcelona weekend. Those who had designed the carbon elements to be too flexible in the past had to retrofit them.\n\n> A flexible front wing, in which the main blade and flaps bend backward, not only reduces drag, resulting in higher top speeds on the straights. The built-in flexibility also helps optimize the setup balance between fast and slow corners.\n\n> In tighter corners, drivers want the front axle to grip the turn. This requires a lot of downforce, which a steeply angled front wing produces. In faster corners, it's more comfortable for the drivers if the rear end doesn't veer off so easily. If the front wing is flatter, the aero balance automatically shifts rearward.\n\n> Since this trick became popular over the past two years, teams have taken increasingly extreme approaches to bending. Development has been increasingly tailored to this. With testing becoming more stringent, engineers now have to put the brakes on. The question is which cars will lose the least performance with the stiffer wings.\n\n> Some teams, including McLaren, predict that the new rules won't significantly change the balance of power from the first eight races. Others, such as Red Bull and Ferrari, hope that the gap to the Papaya cars will be noticeably reduced.\n\n> Barcelona could therefore represent a turning point in the season. The varied track has always been a good indicator for the rest of the year. Those who don't show any weaknesses here will be good anywhere. Many teams are also basing their performance on Barcelona as a factor in how long the development of the 2025 cars will progress.\n\n> The weather isn't expected to cause any additional drama. The latest forecasts call for dry conditions throughout the entire race weekend. Maximum temperatures are expected to only slightly exceed 25¬∞C. A warmer climate would be especially welcome for McLaren. Then they could once again use the tire joker in the race ‚Äì as they did recently in Miami.\n\n> **The track: Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.**\nThe Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya is an ideal benchmark for the cars' performance. Fast corners with high centrifugal forces alternate with medium-speed and slow corners. All-rounders are especially in demand. Those who look good here usually do well on other tracks as well. Because all types of corners are accommodated, an efficient aerodynamic package is required.\n\n> Despite two DRS zones and the more than one-kilometer-long straight, overtaking is traditionally difficult in Barcelona. Qualifying therefore remains crucial. The 600-meter-long sprint into the first corner is one of the longest of the entire season. Here, we often see slipstream battles as the chasing pack chases the man in pole position.\n\n> **Das Setup.**\nBarcelona has been a fixture on the calendar since 1991. The technicians know the track's quirks almost inside and out. The changing winds from the nearby Mediterranean can occasionally throw up surprises. The wings have to be set very steeply at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya to provide sufficient downforce and stability for the fast corner combinations.\n\n> Brake wear is usually not an issue. The engines aren't subjected to excessive strain either. Tires, however, are a regular source of tension in races. As usual, Pirelli brings the very hard compounds C1 to C3. The fast right-hand corners T3 and T9 place particular strain on the left front tire.\n\n> **The Upgrades.**\nAs already mentioned, Barcelona is one of the benchmark tracks in Formula 1. After the wave of upgrades at Imola, we expect to see many new parts on the cars again. Sauber has already announced a larger package. Mercedes also intends to significantly expand its offerings.\n\n> More exciting, however, is the new regulations. Most teams will have to respond to the more stringent endurance tests with reinforced wings. In most cases, the changes will not even be visible from the outside. Mercedes had already conducted test runs in Bahrain and Imola with a stiffer Barcelona wing.\n\n> **The favorites.**\nMcLaren is naturally at the top of the list of favorites again. The high temperatures and above-average tire wear favor Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris. The two Papaya drivers travel to Catalunya separated by just three points. This could cause internal tensions.\n\n> Max Verstappen should be significantly more competitive than he was in Monaco. The fast corners of Barcelona are exactly what the RB21 is looking for. The world champion already showed in Imola that he's ready to take advantage of even the slightest opportunity. Since 2016, only two drivers have won in Barcelona: Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton.\n> Speaking of Hamilton: Barcelona will be Ferrari's last chance to turn things around. The Scuderia must finally get its tire problem under control in qualifying. And the setup window must be larger. In Monaco, they were able to concentrate entirely on the slow corners. In Barcelona, \u200b\u200ball-round qualities will be required again.\n\n> Mercedes also travels to Spain with concerns. Tire wear has been the Silver Arrow's Achilles heel twice this year. If the problem isn't addressed, a Waterloo could occur on the tire-killing track in Barcelona.\n\n> Williams has proven in recent races that while the speed is not enough to get to the front, the car is so consistent that it can score points when the competition is weak.\n\n> Behind them, Toro Rosso, Aston Martin, Haas, and Alpine are also waiting for slip-ups in the tight midfield. Sauber has recently remained well outside the top ten. Fans of the Swiss team will have to hope that the upgrades work."", 'Excitement, excitement aaaand nothing really changes.', 'And after all this anticipation, nothing will change probably', 'I expect no big change.', 'Whatever be the outcome, it will still be a 500X more interesting weekend compared to Monaco imo', 'if somehow aston are the ones most affected by this change as in 2023 and they are the 9th-10th team again I will fucking riot', '100% I am ready to be hurt again.', 'Getting excited for this weekend.']",179,88,0.94,179,803,803,6,0,0.0,6
