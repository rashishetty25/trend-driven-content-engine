1k2wavj,[AMuS] Ferrari seeks consistency,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k2wavj/amus_ferrari_seeks_consistency/,2025-04-19, News,,"['‚ÄùFerrari seeks consistency‚Äù. \n\nSo have we the last 20 years.', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **After four races, Ferrari is still waiting for its first podium finish. The new car is as good as a Mercedes or Red Bull under the best of circumstances. However, it lacks consistency.**\n\n> You have to look very closely for Ferrari\'s good moments this season. Lewis Hamilton\'s sprint victory in Shanghai. Charles Leclerc\'s second place on the grid in Bahrain. The two Ferrari drivers\' solid middle stints at the same race. ""A good stint or a highlight isn\'t enough to win. We need more consistency,"" demands team principal Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur.\n\n> The bottom line is that the disappointments outweigh the disappointments. The poor performance of the red cars in the rain in Melbourne. The disqualification of both cars in Shanghai. The 16-second gap to the winning trio at the Japanese GP, in a race in which everyone was able to drive 53 laps at the limit because their tires barely wore down. The two to four-tenths gap to McLaren. Vasseur sees the Papaya racers as one step ahead of everyone else.\n\n> Although Ferrari had the best car in the second half of the 2024 season, the engineers changed the concept over the winter. The old SF-24 with its pushrod front axle was reaching its limits. The aerodynamicists saw no room to squeeze more out of the underbody.\n\n> **Old car was at its limit.**\nA pullrod front axle, on the other hand, allows the airflow towards the rear to be configured in such a way that, ultimately, more downforce can be produced. But that\'s precisely where Ferrari is currently struggling. ""We don\'t have a further development of last year\'s model, but rather a new car. It will take time until we find the right car balance for all conditions,"" the team principal apologizes.\n\n> Leclerc is on the right track. Last year\'s third-place finisher in the World Championship knows the team inside and out, and he has a reference point in mind with the old car. After Suzuka, Leclerc said with relief: ""I think I\'ve now found a way to get more out of the car with the setup."" The eight-time GP winner also made it clear: ""To beat McLaren, we need more upgrades.""\n\n> Lewis Hamilton isn\'t quite there yet. The team\'s newcomer is still experimenting too much. ""Charles is largely staying true to his setup over the weekend. I\'m still tweaking the car a lot to get a better feel for it. At the same time, I\'m trying to adapt my driving style.""\n\n> **New subfloor opens window.**\nFerrari already introduced a new underbody in Bahrain. It wasn\'t a response to the problems of the early races, but it did address a weak point of the SF-25 that the engineers had apparently already been aware of. Compared to its predecessor, the working window has been significantly narrowed. Ideally, Ferrari would have to run extremely low everywhere, but that\'s not possible because it would otherwise cause excessive wear on the underbody.\n\n> The new underbody is intended to open up this window somewhat and deliver the same downforce across a wider setup range. Bahrain was a small first step forward, according to Vasseur. But more such steps must follow. ""We have the ingredients for a good car, we just need to put them together correctly at the right time. I have the feeling that Mercedes and Red Bull, and usually one of the two McLarens, aren\'t doing any better.""\n\n> Vasseur is annoyed that defeats are often portrayed as major dramas. ""We\'re talking about a tenth of a second here, one way or the other. That made five starting positions in Bahrain. One tiny mistake is enough, and you either look good or bad. Red Bull wins in Suzuka and trails in Bahrain. But it\'s still the same car.""', 'A consistent p5-p7', ""We're consistently inconsistent. We're already there"", '""Next year"" has been pretty consistent theme for the past decade.', 'Same old Ferrari excuses. \n\nI feel sorry for Lewis and Charles. At least Lewis already has 7 titles and is a GOAT but Charles has no titles and with Max on the grid, he could end up retiring with no titles which will be one of the most terrible things of the sport.', 'The SF-25  has serious design flaws. Its the only top car that is struggling with ride height this year. Those were the kind of issues that teams solved back in 2023.\n\nThe 24 Ferrari was an extremely well balanced car. How the fuck did they mess this up so badly?\n\nEven Leclerc is complaining about the car being extremely tricky to drive. So Hamilton struggling is not really a surprise.\n\nIMO, Ferrari should write this season off and just focus on the new regs. The gap to Mclaren is just too big.', 'They are consistent. \n\nConsistently underwhelming.', 'And i seek happiness... not in life general but in Ferrari doing good in F1 .... both are so far away from reality...']",108,32,0.94,108,263,263,1,0,0.0,1

I know there are a lot of variables at play, but I'm hoping to start a conversation that can help clarify some of this. A few questions and thoughts:\n\nLewis Hamilton vs. Charles Leclerc:\nLewis moved to Ferrari this season and seems to be getting outperformed by Charles pretty consistently. Last season, Lewis finished behind George Russell in the standings at Mercedes. This makes me wonder: is Lewis on the decline, or is this just because Lewis is adjusting to a brand-new car? But then‚Ä¶\n\nCarlos Sainz in Williams:\nCarlos jumped into an unfamiliar car and is still performing at a high level. While he was getting outperformed by Alex the first few races, it seems he‚Äôs gotten more comfortable with the car. Today‚Äôs qualifying session really highlighted that. It raises the question: would Ferrari have been better off keeping Sainz instead of bringing in Hamilton? Ofc he‚Äôs 7xWDC so it‚Äôs not a BAD choice, but would the alternative have been better for Ferrari?\n\n\nIs Leclerc a potential world champion in the right car?\nI've often heard that Leclerc has ‚Äúworld champion‚Äù level talent, but Ferrari as a team seems to keep letting him down. When they had a faster car, their strategy was mind boggling. Now it seems like the car is less competitive. If he were in a McLaren (which looks fastest right now), how do you think he‚Äôd compare to Lando Norris across a season?\n\nThe Mercedes factor:\nMercedes seems to have built a stronger car this season, and George Russell is doing well with it. If Lewis had stayed at Mercedes, where do you think he‚Äôd rank on the grid this season? Could he be ahead of Leclerc in the Ferrari?\n\nMax talent vs McLaren speed:\nMax skill level appears to be advanced far enough beyond Lando and Oscar that their better car doesn‚Äôt always cover the gap. He‚Äôs even said something to the effect of being way in front of everyone if he was in the McLaren. So since we know drivers can have faster cars, but perform worse than a more skilled driver in a slower car, if you put Max, Charles, George, Carlos, Lando and Lewis in the same car, who‚Äôs got the goods, in what order? (Currently, I think it‚Äôs the order I listed them in) Of course driver preference has an impact but I‚Äôm curious about compared skill. \n\nI know these questions don‚Äôt have clear-cut answers, but I‚Äôd love to hear perspectives from fans who‚Äôve been following the sport longer. How do you personally balance car vs driver when evaluating performance?\n\nAppreciate any insight you‚Äôre willing to share! Please don‚Äôt roast me. This is just what I thinking about while watching."", ""I just watched a video from Top Gear where their performance car reviewer Jethro Bovington tests the RB17 in the sim. In the TX spec, which is the highest performance spec of the car, running confidential Michelin tyres, he managed to lap at a pace that would've put him fifth on the F1 grid last year. \n\nIt's pretty insane that all of this stuff will be real later this year and next year. If a decently skilled amateur driver can put that car 5th on the 2024 F1 grid, I can only imagine what an F1 driver (Max?) could do with that thing."", 'what are your top 10 non title winning seasons of drivers that finished in the top 3 ?', 'On Sky Germany, Marko was apparently talking about retiring soon and wanting Seb as his successor', 'Do both McLaren drivers have the upgrade on their car?']",10,77,0.71,10,137,137,-2,1,-0.040000000000000036,-2
