1js35c1,[AMuS] Verstappen's impossible pole,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1js35c1/amus_verstappens_impossible_pole/,2025-04-05, News,,"['Translation and full article:\n\n\n> Max Verstappen expected fourth place at best. But then the Dutchman put his Red Bull on pole position with a dream lap. There are four reasons why this miracle happened.\n\n> The radio call on the out lap spoke volumes. Max Verstappen loudly shouted his joy at his 41st pole position in Formula 1, his first since the 2024 Austrian GP, \u200b\u200binto the airwaves. Normally, the Dutchman is relatively relaxed on the radio. He\'s achieved so many victories and set so many fastest times in his career that one more or less doesn\'t elicit much emotion from him. But this time, everything was different.\n\n> The Formula 1 World Champion expected fourth place on the grid at best. His Red Bull struggled to find its form for three practice sessions, despite the engineers\' thorough redesign of the car. The Red Bull RB21 fluctuated between decent and undriveable. Verstappen complained that he never knew what the car would do in the next corner. In the third practice session, he was still half a second behind the McLaren.\n\n> Only the final intervention was successful. ""We completely overhauled our car,"" reported team principal Christian Horner. ""Everything was put to the test: the weight distribution, the downforce level, the damper, spring, and anti-roll bar settings, and the tire pressures.""\n\n> **Red Bull hit the window.**\nThe trump card played in crisis mode worked. Starting in Q1, the drivers sensed that the Red Bull was suddenly a good racing car again. ""The differences are minimal. If you fall out of the window by just a millimeter, you\'re immediately nowhere,"" Horner marveled. Verstappen praised: ""The car was difficult to drive for a long time, but we improved it step by step and worked our way towards a good setup.""\n\n> But then you\'ll still need Max Verstappen in the cockpit to convert the improved handling into the fastest qualifying time. ""I was at the limit everywhere, even a little over here and there,"" reported the defending champion. Not only that, Verstappen completed two clean laps in Q3. Lando Norris, Oscar Piastri, and George Russell all lost time in the first sector.\n\n> Piastri and Russell were blown away by the wind in Turn 2. On Saturday (April 5), the wind blew from the opposite direction to Friday. A tailwind made the notorious S-curves even more challenging than usual. Piastri\'s manager, Mark Webber, lamented: ""With any other Sector 1 time in his qualifying laps, Oscar would have taken pole position. But there\'s no reward for ideal times."" Horner applauded his driver: ""That was perhaps the lap of his life.""\n\n> **Verstappen\'s Fear Curve was Degner 2.**\nRed Bull responded correctly to the changed conditions. They opted for a touch more downforce to give the drivers more confidence through the S-bends. This also helped bring the tires into their temperature window for the beginning of the lap. But Verstappen\'s problem area wasn\'t the S-bends, but Degner 2.\n\n> Verstappen had lost two-tenths to the McLarens on every lap there, Horner revealed. Except for the decisive attempt. He was suddenly just as fast because he kept his tires in the window during the first section of the track to ensure optimal grip in his fear corner. The showdown in the duel with the McLarens was thus moved to the chicane before the start and finish. And there, the Red Bull driver took 66 thousandths off Norris.\n\n> According to Verstappen, pole position was the easier part of the task. Up until now, the McLarens had primarily demonstrated their strength in the race. However, there is a small glimmer of hope. The McLaren drivers were the only ones experiencing grainy front tires during the long runs in third practice. Norris more so than Piastri. An expert from the rivals commented: ""This suggests that they want to keep their rear tires as close to the temperature window as possible.""\n\n> Nevertheless, Verstappen prefers to play the pessimist for the race. He sees McLaren as the favorite. If it weren\'t for the weather. Rain is forecast for parts of Sunday. If that leads to mixed conditions during the race, it will play into the hands of the best Formula 1 driver. Piastri is unfazed: ""We\'re fast on both wet and dry tracks.""', ""Crazy performance by Max. On another day he is behind George and the McLarens.\n\nFelt like Max maximized the performance of the car and they didn't.\n\nSadly I don't this the grand Prix is winnable without something crazy happening"", 'Netflix: We got something, take notes.

Mclaren's advantage is greater than within the reach of a good setup by Redbull. Norris and Piastri continue to let down the car.\n\nBut in the race, tyre preservation will lead the way. I still expect a 1-2 for Mclaren. At least one of them will overtake Max in the first stint, and the 2nd probably undercuts and that's that."", ""Max even admitted, he went all out and thought he was going to crash a few times.\nNorris said in a interview he tried to push the car but it didn't work out for him.\nPiastri basically said they same thing.\n\nNo throwing shade on Max, it was an incredible drive.

Interesting to see are their two different approaches: Lando lifts straight off the throttle and stomps then back on it, whereas Max has a more ""rounded"" approach to this. Lando gets the better exit and goes flat through T3, where Max has to lift slightly. Max gains time by being on the throttle longer inbetween T4 and T5, yet has a worse exit out of T6. In the Dunlop (T7), Lando has to lift slightly, which brings Max back to his tail. The Degners paint a clear picture: Max is longer on the throttle, lifts more gradual, yet steps on back on it just as quick, lifts more gradual, brakes 10 metres later and hops back onto the throttle as quick as Lando does. Nonetheless, has a worse exit out of the Degners and loses time approaching the Hairpin. Max has a slightly better exit out of it and begins clawing back speed to Lando. Spoon is the masterpiece of this lap: Braking about 40 metres later than Lando, he carries more speed into T14, where he doesn't bother with feathering like Lando, but steps once onto the accelerator. Yet, a significantly worse exits loses him quite some speed until T15. At the Casino Triangle, the strategy should be clear to everyone by now: Max brakes 30 metres later and and steps more onto the throttle inbetween T16 and T17, but has, yet again, a worse exit out of this tricky last corners. Lando gains much speed approaching T18, but is momentarily stationary on the throttle pedal. Max comes closer again and this was maybe the difference inbetween P1 and P2 today.

My conclusion: Despite his many complaints, Max has complete trust into the cars braking characteristics and is able to compensate much this way, despite not being able to step onto the the accelerator as soon as Lando (as seen inbetween the Degners and T16/17).  
(the eagle-eyed may have spotted, that Lando's throttle graph is slightly beneath Max's in the high-speed factions. In fact, he drives at 99%, a few spikes exclued, where Max is at 100%. Two theories of mine: Either the data is faulty OR McLaren has built in a mechanical resistor into the gas pedal, which the pilots have to overpower to get the pedal to the metal. Not to conceal massive power, but to slightly improve reliability) ","['I would love to see a ghost car lap comparison like the one for China', ""Margin so fine my blind ass without glasses couldn't see after staring for 3 minutes straight"", ""30M into the final chicane sounds way off.

That same design proved successful for quite some years, until it didn’t. \n\nThe problem is in the way the mechanical forces disrupt the tricky balance of a peak aerodynamic setup. I assume as other teams found their sweet spots and improved, RB had to improve as well. \n\nBut how do you improve now that you can’t really add much more in the aerodynamics department, and adding new mechanical elements to improve it comes at a cost of aero balance ?

For 4 years you are a best-seller, industry leader, a soda giant. But then the 5th year your competitors start doing  something new. Adding more fizz, adding other flavours, having better ingredients etc.  And since grapefruit is something your customers seem to love, you add more of it to fight the competition. But the soda then becomes too bitter, so you add more sugar, but now it’s too sweet. But you can’t really reduce the grapefruit now, that’s what your soda is mostly about.

It was hilarious. Its like Jacques is trying to actively not tweak in his seat listening to Crofty's takes.

Although Villeneueve seems like he's a little stuck in the days he used to race in F1, I find his takes very insightful race craft wise (wdc afterall...), more than Crofty at least. And his opinion refreshing. I may not agree with him on some but it's refreshing to see a clash of opinions.

One instance during the last few laps: Crofty was like ""what are mclaren doing, let piastry pass lando to challenge max so we can finally have some racing"" and Villeneueve was like ""yeahh.... no he shouldn't, I wouldn't have lol. Every point counts individually, its champion mentality""

They took a risk, and it's been paying off. No one had any problem with it then to stop it, and also any other team had the ability to put the money down and buy Minardi outright themselves. They didn't, so now they can't be crying foul on a move that was made legally, even if it doesn't help them. And Redbull aren't the only team in F1 that have little side deals / rub my back, ill rub yours type of relationships behind the scenes.

Not only do they get to put their juniors in their customer B teams which is the only advantage RB has, they also get the engine data from their customers which they can use to further improve their engines.

Obviously, those are the goals they should achieve. They obviously do have the best car. But my question is how dominant do you all think they should be?

It seems that any failed pole or win in the eyes of many, is a failure or “bottle” in the eyes of many who watch this season, so my question is, should they achieve EVERY POLE position and EVERY WIN this year? 

In my opinion the car isn’t at that level of dominance, like an MP4/4 or Schumacher 04 challenger. Not even close, but I’d like to hear other’s thoughts.
","['They have the best car in qualifying and race pace. In qualifying is it very close though so a small mistake can cost them as well saw today. Races should be won by them barring some freak events', 'I think what Red Bull did in 2023 has created an unrealistic view of what having the fastest car actually means. There is a difference between having the fastest car and being absolutely dominant like the rb19 and max were in 2023. It was a generational talent in an extraordinary car.', ""I don't expect them to win every race. I think they have two very good drivers, but they don't have drivers that can get the car to dominate like Max/Lewis would. I think, as it stands now, they should win around 60% of the races. I just think Merc/Ferrari/Red Bull will snatch races because of mistakes by Norris/Piastri/McLaren"", ""To be honest I think Mclaren need to be aiming for more wins than pole positions I would never be surprised if another team snatches pole from them considering that Verstappen 'only' got 12 pole positions out of 23 races in 2023 yet still dominated the races the Mclaren car is undisputedly the best over a race distance I think we can definitely say that, however the only times the car genuinely looked 'unbeatable' was in my opinion those small patches of wet to dry during Australia but the thing is Mclaren showed they had this ability last year if you remembered Canada or Britian that car unlocks something in those conditions, ultimately my point is I don't consider every failed pole a 'bottle' I think that's ridiculous all that should matter is that Mclaren should be able to maximize the amazing race car they have on Sunday."", 'IMO they chose a setup that was not optimized for quali pace but for race pace and had the belief in their car to still secure the front row, rightfully so. That lap from Max was just an unexpected event.', 'I think we could have a similar situation to 2010 when Red Bull had definitely the fastest car but the drivers and the team weren’t driving at the same level as Alonso and Hamilton in the cars behind.\xa0\n\nThis year Piastri and Norris play the roles of Vettel and Webber. Verstappen and Russell play the roles of Alonso amd Hamilton.', 'Warning for long-winded rambling, but: I think people are needlessly harsh on the McLaren drivers because we’ve gotten used to watching Max and Lewis and Seb.\n\nIs that car outright faster than any other team? Yes. If every car was driven by the exact same driver, should that car be the one that wins? Yes. Would it be fair to expect Lando / Oscar to win literally every race? No. Not at all. Think of all the variables at play, even beyond what can occur in a single race: you’ve got two of the best drivers to ever drive in this sport in the top 8 right now and one of them is in his prime, there are also a bunch of very talented non-WDC drivers who are always ready to capitalise, the field is close compared to previous seasons, the whole drama with the front wings will happen, and teams will always bring upgrades… \n\nConsidering all of that, I’ll be mega impressed if either Lando or Oscar get more than 6 wins this season. After all, aside from Rosberg, who was in the dominant Mercedes, all the champions from the last 20 years that aren’t named Michael, Sebastian, Lewis or Max, have won with a maximum of 7 wins for the whole season. No one looks at those drivers and calls them washed or acts like they bottled because they didn’t win every other race. We’re just so used to this frankly insane dominance from the recent WDCs that we are somehow acting like it’s to be expected. It’s not. It doesn’t mean we shouldn’t expect that car to win - it’s clearly very fast, so it should if everything goes right. But that doesn’t make it *easy* to go out there and pull off a 2023/2020/2013/2004 level season. Those drivers and teams were operating at elite levels in those years and to act like that’s just “to be expected” is frankly doing those seasons a disservice.', 'They have the best car so the constructors championship should be the minimum target.

I think this would work great especially if it was a mandatory use all three compounds rule, that way you create more strategic jeopardy. We’ve seen this year that the gaps between cars are so close, and therefore they can’t really overtake because they lack the pace advantage. Having this would create more room for jeopardy because you could undercut one time and overcut another time. It also creates more a pace difference, especially between soft and hard tyres.
