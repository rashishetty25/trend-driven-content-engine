Alonso was in points, so they decided to get Alonso on a more conservative strategy. The only bad thing about the inter-to-slick pit was that it was too soon, they should have pitted Alonso two or three laps later, but at the same time it was time to take some risks with Alonso as he could be out of the points.\n\nI see it more as a stroke of good luck for Stroll than Alonso being unlucky again. I can only wish he could get more of those strokes', 'The biggest problem was that when his inters were dead they pitted Lance instead of him gifting him track position over Alonso making him lose a huge amount of time\n\nNot just that the slick call was way too early', 'For not the first time this season, the lower qualifying positions use a gamble strat and wins big.

Same as when Gasly threw gravel on the track just ahead of him in Australia in low visibility conditions and when his engine expired in Monaco.\xa0', 'It was the 2nd pit stop that ruined everything. He asked to box for fresh inters a lap before. But they pitted stroll first. Then he lost out massively. Just like the Miami sprint race where he asked to pit but they left him out for ages', 'Stroll gets ""experimental"" strategies actually more often than people probably realize - he tends to qualify significantly behind Alonso / way too far away from points. It doesn\'t always work, in fact it doesn\'t most of the time but when it does it yields some very good results. \n\nFor Alonso, the big problem is, I noticed, is that the team is just very slow to react. Undercuts almost never happen, Alonso is often left out 2-3 laps longer than he should be, the tyre dropoff is also brutal on the aston which makes things much worse.', 'Alonso was basically given the same strategy as the frontrunners staying out and then pitting for fresh inters on lap 11 which most of the grid did. Hulkenberg was the first driver to pit for inters on lap 9, then Stroll and Hadjar both pit for inters on lap 10, before everyone else followed on lap 11. \n\nAt the time Alonso was up in P6 only behind both McLarens, Verstappen, Hamilton, and Gasly. I think Stroll had a lot less to lose being further back so he pit first for softs on lap 7 during the VSC, a very bold call that no one else on the grid did.\n\nSo I agree with you that Alonso was more so unlucky that he lost out because Aston Martin were playing it safe as he was already high up in P6, whereas they gambled with Stroll and actually benefited massively. \n\nBut they later also took a gamble with Alonso as he was the first car to pit from the second set of inters and switch to slicks on the mediums, which turned out to be several laps too early. \n\nOverall Alonso was just unlucky when it came to the strategy calls.

1ltwsx8,Should the F1 rain light stay on constantly in heavy spray instead of blinking?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ltwsx8/should_the_f1_rain_light_stay_on_constantly_in/,2025-07-07, Discussion,"During the British GP, Hadjar crashed into Antonelli in extremely poor visibility. Afterward, he said he only saw the red rear light at the last moment‚Äîtoo late to react.

**That made me wonder: why do F1 rain lights still blink during heavy spray?**

In light rain, blinking might help grab attention. But in dense spray, the off-moments make the car ahead briefly invisible, which is exactly when you need to see it. A solid, constantly lit rain light would likely be more visible through the mist, even if less ‚Äúattention-grabbing‚Äù on paper.

According to older threads and technical docs, the rain light flashes at ~4Hz in wet conditions and ~2Hz during ERS harvesting, but a solid mode does exist (like during pit limiter). Why not use it when visibility is at its worst?

With wet races becoming more common, shouldn't the FIA consider making the rain light stay on instead of flashing in extreme spray?","[""A blinking or strobing light demands your attention, a single continuous light would eventually start being ignored because it's there constantly. It's why every emergency vehicle has strobing lights."", 'Having two lights side by side in each of the three ""points"" of the triangle, that flash on and off alternately, would possibly help.\n\nThat way there\'s a light visible all of the time, but the flashing makes the light move to still draw attention to it.', ""I've raced in rain worse than this weekend. You can't see any of the lights whether they're blinking, solid or anything. When it's that bad you have no choice but to drive as if you're all running race pace. If someone spins or slows down dramatically you are hitting them 100% of the time. Nothing you can do about it. That's why race directors stop races or pull out the safety car. If you can't stop in half the distance you can see ahead to be clear, it is not safe to race.\n\nTLDR, it doesn't matter in the slightest. By the time you see the light you are incapable of stopping."", 'That light was off more than it was on. It needs to blink way more frequently than it does.', 'On Missed Apex they were talking about giving drivers an infrared HUD.

That makes total sense in general visibility conditions. But I still feel like dense spray during wet races is a different beast entirely.\n\nWhen you have 0.5 seconds to react and the light is ""off"" during the one moment you need it ‚Äî that‚Äôs when the blinking works against you.
