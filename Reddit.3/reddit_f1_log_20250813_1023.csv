1mp083y,Explained: How the FIA plans to avoid a repeat of Mercedes' 2014 scenario in F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mp083y/explained_how_the_fia_plans_to_avoid_a_repeat_of/,2025-08-13, Technical,,"[""Tldr:\n\nThe fear:\n\n>some fear it could pave the way for long-term dominance by a single manufacturer. Memories go back to 2014, when Mercedes’ engine proved significantly superior to the rest of the field\n\nThe reason FIA do t think this will happen:\n\n1.\n>The FIA’s single-seater director believes the new engine formula is less complex, despite the substantial increase in electrical power: “The engines are still not as simple as we would have liked. We would have liked to go further, but we had a lot of resistance against simplifying the regulations more. So there are things that we would have liked to be even simpler, but they are still simpler than the current generation of engines. They don't have the MGU-H, and there are a few things that have tighter limits, so we don't think the gaps will be as big as in 2014.”\n\n>Back then, the MGU-H proved a major performance differentiator - and a very costly one. For both of those reasons it will disappear in 2026, a change that should provide newcomers with a more level playing field while also reducing development costs.\n\n2.\n>“We do have newcomers, and it is always a risk at the start of a new cycle that there is some divergence initially,” Tombazis said. “Additionally, we have a cost gap for the PU manufacturers now.” It means that manufacturers who are behind cannot simply throw unlimited money at their engine projects. To still offer them possibilities to catch up, the FIA has included a new system into the 2026 regulations.\n\n>“For that reason, there is a concept called ADUO, which is an acronym for Additional Development and Upgrade Opportunities,”\n\n>Essentially every five, six races there will be an average performance measured for each PU manufacturer. Those who are below a certain level, and depending on how much below they are, will get that benefit accumulating over the year. That benefit would translate into three things: one is additional development money, some more dyno hours and the possibility to make a new homologation of the engine\n\n>this assessment will be made after the first five race weekends each season"", ""A team can still dominate; how many resources this year and last have gone towards this? For some teams, a lot more than in 2013. What Mercedes accomplished is still marvelous, but it's like tanking in any NA sports league to get a high draft pick, draft a player that'll be a corner stone for a title contending team for the next generation. But at the end of the day, if you've got a problem, fix your f$\\*()#\\* car."", 'Simple, provide info to all engine manufacturers at the same time instead of 4 years after you provide it to Mercedes who pitched and pushed for that specific engine formula in the first place', 'Why they took so long to change the rules after the Mercedes 2014 dominance?\n\nI may be wrong, but waiting until 2021/2022 for a change was too long.', 'At least Russell would get his spotlight for once even if it happens.', 'The worst thing that could happen to F1 right now is one team dominating for five to six years. Eventually it would lead to casual fans (those who have latched on through DTS, the movie, word of mouth) to drop off again. Ideally we need four or five teams that are regularly fighting at the front, with any of them able to win on any given Sunday if they hook up the car, the strategy, the execution - kind of like 2010, 2012.', 'There is no token system this time so even if someone runs away with their engine it should be easier to catch up', 'F1 has gone downhill since Bernice sold it. Love him or hate him, he managed the formula brilliantly.
