1n5trk2,My Experience with Disabilities at the Dutch Grand Prix ‚Äì Accessibility in F1 Needs Serious Attention,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n5trk2/my_experience_with_disabilities_at_the_dutch/,2025-09-01, Discussion,"Hi all,
I wanted to share my experience attending the 2025 Dutch Grand Prix as someone living with Crohn‚Äôs disease and rheumatoid arthritis, in the hope it raises awareness around how inaccessible F1 events can be for fans with disabilities.
This was my first Grand Prix, and I was so excited to finally go. I‚Äôd booked the F1 Experiences Live Pit Straight package (not exactly a budget ticket) and reached out months in advance to explain my needs ‚Äì mainly urgent toilet access and limited mobility when walking fast or through crowds. I made it really clear that I carry a ""Can‚Äôt Wait"" card due to my Crohn‚Äôs and need bathroom access urgently at times.
Here‚Äôs how it went:
Thursday ‚Äì Track Experience Day:
No seating in the main areas during waiting times for the pit walk or guest appearances. I had to stand for hours, which caused joint pain.
No visible bathrooms near the food trucks, so I avoided eating altogether in case I needed the toilet quickly.
The pit lane walk was late in the day, and most garages were closing down due to curfew ‚Äì it felt like others who went earlier got a more engaging experience.
Friday‚ÄìSunday ‚Äì Race Days:
My grandstand seat (Row 2, Seat 134 on the Pit Straight Grandstand) was not near the extra care court, despite requests. I had to walk through heavy crowds to reach it ‚Äì not ideal when you physically can‚Äôt move fast or stand comfortably.
On Saturday, I had an arthritis flare-up and couldn‚Äôt make it back to my seat. I spent most of the day in the care court instead.
The extra care court staff were amazing ‚Äì they offered me a chair and even helped with ice for my knee. But I missed out on watching most of the race from my actual seat because it was just too far from the bathroom.
The bigger issue:
It honestly feels like basic accessibility at F1 events is tied to VIP ticket levels. If you want decent toilet access, seating support, or less walking, you have to spend thousands. That‚Äôs not right.
Accessible event planning shouldn‚Äôt be treated as a luxury add-on. I paid over ¬£1,400 for my ticket and still ended up spending half the weekend worrying about whether I could reach a toilet in time.
As a fan, a content creator, and someone living with chronic illness, I want to enjoy the sport I love without feeling like I don‚Äôt belong at the track. And I know I‚Äôm not the only one.
Final thoughts:
F1 needs to do better. Accessibility shouldn't depend on how much you can afford. I‚Äôd love to see:
Clearly marked accessible toilets and seating near all grandstands.
Disability support staff onsite for guidance.
More flexibility in seating assignments for those who request help in advance.
Actual disability liaison contacts for fans planning to attend.
I‚Äôll be sharing more content about my experience to raise awareness, but I wanted to start here. If you‚Äôve had a similar experience or know of other venues doing accessibility well, I‚Äôd love to hear about it.
Thanks for reading ‚Äì feel free to share or comment if you think this is a conversation F1 needs to keep having.

&#x200B;

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

These rules of engagement are not conducive for actual racing. A driver can simply be ahead at the apex, know they have right of way, meaning they can just drive to the outside of the corner knowing they cannot be challenged, or if an accident occurs knowing they will not be at fault.

We need cars to go side by side to overtake, it‚Äôs just a fact. If a car can hold the outside line, for almost the entire corner, and be almost in line or at least half way up to the car alongside it, the inside driver should be required to leave one cars width in the exit. 

The current rules allow two cars in to a corner, but only one to come out. If two go in, two should come out. We are losing classic battles and excitement in the sport. 

Would really love to see something changed. Rant over!","[""The problem is trying to have a one size fits all rule.

But if you already gave space, you can't change lines to crash into someone and have them take penalty. Because giving space wasn't mandatory. \n\nLawson was inside and sainz was outside.
