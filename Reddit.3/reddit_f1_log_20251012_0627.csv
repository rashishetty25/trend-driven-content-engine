They were always happy to see me. Even if they had destroyed something in the house I was quick to forgive them.\n\nTo add to the pain of losing some part of your self, your life, your routine, there is the context of euthanasia. I had to make the very painful decision to euthanize my younger dog because his cancer was progressing rapidly. Otherwise, he was a healthy dog with a lot of love for life.
