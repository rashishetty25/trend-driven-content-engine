1o5ftsq,Can Max (or anyone) catch Hamilton for wins at different circuits?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o5ftsq/can_max_or_anyone_catch_hamilton_for_wins_at/,2025-10-13, Statistics,"Lewis’s career spans three different rule cycles — and he’ll be going into a fourth one soon. During the early 2010s, F1 introduced a lot of new circuits (like Korea, India, Turkey, etc.), many of which were later dropped. Nowadays, there’s much less variation in the calendar — a few tracks might fall off (Imola, Zandvoort, Spa), and only one new track (Madrid) is added.

On the current calendar, the only circuit left for Max to win at is Singapore (and Madrid if Red Bull builds a strong enough car).

The combination of career longevity, era transitions, and addition and deletion of tracks that helped Hamilton reach 31 is hard to replicate in today’s more stable F1 calendar.

Other current drivers' stats for this:

* Alonso - 19
* Norris - 9
* Piastri - 9
* Leclerc - 7
* Russell - 5
* Sainz - 4","['It all depends on how much variety FOM allows', ""assuming lewis never wins again max only needs 5 more races, it's really not unreasonable for him to reach lewis if he sticks around in F1 for as long as lewis has\n\nright now he has singapore and madrid left, but it'd be foolish to assume the gaps left by zandvoort and spa (even if spa is only gone for intermittent seasons) won't be filled with new tracks or tracks max never won at\n\nmax is also 28, 12 years younger than lewis. If he stuck around until 2037 he would most likely beat lewis unless he has some alonso level luck with his teams"", 'It is pretty much just a question of how long Verstappen races and if Red Bull find dominance again.\n\nHamilton still has a chance to add to that next year as well.', 'Probably not max, I dont think he is going to stay in the sport for long enough to beat it as hes already spending more and more time with other series than just formula racing', 'Seeing that many circuits have very long contracts, it might not be broken. Max could add Madrid and Signapore, in a couple of years maybe the new track in Saudi Arabia. But he already is pretty close and still no 30 years old. SO for max it seems possible.', 'Hard because alot of the current tracks got long extensions and the calendar cant really be expanded more than the current number of races/season\n\nBesides the stupid Madrid track there hasnt been solid rumours about new venues, only random populist politicians in random countries saying they will bring f1 there to farm some votes. But nothing realistic', 'The question is would anyone other than Vettel win in India and the answer should be oh let it happen, racing gods.', 'Wow, how is Mansell so high on this?', 'Apart from Vegas is there anywhere in the current calendar that Lewis still hasn’t won at?', ""There's only 1 circuit left on the calender max hasnt won in yet, assuming he does win in singspore one day he still needs to win in 4 more and that also comes down to other countries and the FIA\n\nIndia could come back if the tax system is changed.\nSouth Africa hasn't really got a chance considering the economical state of South Africa even though they are strengthening it's not gonna be for another 5 years till they are able to hold another GP event \n\nRiyadh Qiddiyya isn't gonna open till 6 Qiddiyya projects have been done that includes entertainment hubs and hotels ( we have barely done project 1 and thats just arranging the land and planning to put stuff down currently most of the work is at other projects inside Riyadh) \n\nMalaysia could come back if they negotiate for better terms but that means America would have to give up a race or someone else \n\nI have heard some Germans in investment banking say negotiations are being made to open another German GP either Hockenheim or a street circuit \n\nWe could always go back to the ports of Spain \n\nI heard from a few Swedish Investors they plan to propose to the Swedish government to host an F1 event but their heads pace is elsewhere outside of F1 \n\nIf all these were on the table and were subbed for other tracks I think max could end up topping hamilton but it all depends on the economy of the current F1 GP countries and unlike 10 years ago F1 has become much much bigger earning those countries much more income than before like 20 years ago""]",111,23,0.93,111,23,23,111,23,0.93,111

Their competitors also use loopholes that the FIA is trying to close all the time, yet somehow they don't lose out **that** badly. Is Ferrari using the grey areas of the rules too much and losing out too much, when in the end the FIA comes knocking on the doors of Maranello? It's an interesting take that I haven't really seen before. \n\nThis is also the first time I see that weird asymmetric brake theory that got debunked about Red Bull so many times, linked to another team.
