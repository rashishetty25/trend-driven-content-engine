However, those 15 years have had very different outcomes, of some years seeing a straight cruise to the record books, versus others with a number of different drivers in contention right through the final race. 

Currently, our grid is not only very rookie-heavy, but the dominance over the most recent regulations cycle has dwindled the number of drivers to ever have taken part in an earnest title battle. 

At any point in any season, only Fernando Alonso, Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, and Lando Norris have ever truly been in the running to win the WDC. Considering that 3 of them are champions themselves, that's a pretty surprising statistic. 

Considering that FOM themselves have hyped up long shots like Perez in 2023 or Bottas for a number of years, there are seasons in which a great deal of drivers have had more legitimate title shots than any of the other 15 drivers on this year's grid... but of course, with aspiring competitors in potentially top seats like Piastri, Lawson, Russell, and Antonelli, we may add to this list quickly!
