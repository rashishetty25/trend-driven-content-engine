Video context:

there was an accident and the driver needed treatment on the track. The driver also had to be taken to a medical center and the track was closed so that a helicopter could land on the track to remove the driver. The video shows the track, with the helicopter on the ground and some people around, and it also shows the doctors attending to the driver. You can hear the roar of an engine racing, which shouldn't be happening since the track was closed. Suddenly, an F1 car appears on the curve behind the helicopter, at high speed. The driver manages to slow down in time and avoid crashing into the helicopter or the people on the track. As far as I remember, there was a radio failure and the driver didn't know that the track had been closed, almost causing an accident.

The problem is that I don't remember anything else. I don't remember who, when or where. Does anyone here know what situation I'm talking about and/or can point me to this video?

Thanks!","[""You're probably thinking of Eric Comas that got onto the track after Senna's crash at Imola in 1994""]",1,1,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1.0,1

The women in the junior categories are under F1 academy, so what exactly is the F1 academy and how is it different from the other junior series? \n\nThe junior series and it's categories have always been a little confusing for me since I'm a relatively new fan trying to learn about F1. Any explanation would be helpful thank you!"", ""Was China 2007 Raikkonen's greatest all round weekend performance? He topped every single practice session, Q1, Q2 and only missed out on pole position because Hamilton had 3 laps less fuel than him. Fuel corrected, he was on pole, also was 0.177 faster than Massa, having 3 laps more fuel than him (Massa made a mistake in the final corner though). \n\nHe was absolutely brilliant in the first stint, and was faster than Massa in 14 of the first 17 laps (As Massa pitted on the 17th lap of the race), despite having 3 laps more fuel than Massa. Pulled off 3 consecutive fastest laps, as Massa pitted and cut the gap to Hamilton from 8 to 4 seconds. And let's not forget, he did all of that in mixed conditions, so they were not dry at all. Also, Massa was running  3rd, just behind Raikkonen, so he has no excuse for roadblock or traffic as well. Both Raikkonen and Hamilton were left with the same set of wet tires after their stops, as they were not changed. Raikkonen conserved it better than Hamilton, and overtook him for the lead.\n\nA lot of people try to give Kubica a lot of credit for this race, but Heidfeld had 3 laps more fuel than Kubica, and still outqualified him. He was running ahead of Kubica as well, but Sauber pitted Heidfeld for the wet tires, while Kubica for the dry tires. Kubica got lucky that he pitted for dry tires at the right time, while Heidfeld had to pit after 4 laps again for the dry tires, so he lost all his advantage and dropped behind Kubica. Raikkonen pitted 8 laps after Kubica's stop for dry tires, and was only 3 seconds behind him. He had fresh tires, and with the car advantage, he would've won that race even then (In a case where Kubica got incredibly lucky). \n\nI know Raikkonen had some blisteringly quick/dominant drives in his McLaren years (Spain 2005, Monaco 2005, Silverstone 2004, France 2005 to name a few), but this one is so underrated because nobody talks about it at all. And, it happened on the 2nd last weekend of the championship, when Raikkonen took the championship away by 1 point after Brazil."", 'Does any one know where I can watch the sky broadcasts for past F1 seasons (particularly the 2010-2020 seasons) in Australia. I currently use Kayo but it has a really limited selection of past races beyond those from this year.', ""So haven't seen anything on here... but wonder if any drivers/teams will want to refuse going to Baku. Freak accident/disaster that could happen around a lot of flight paths, but flying anywhere near Russia or the middle east right now can't be anyones first choice..."", 'Am I wrong to have got frustrated with Drive to Survive and stopped watching after two series? I felt like I was watching 30 minute commercials selling F1 to a US audience. Driver spats! Inter-team rivalries! Will Buxton telling me this is the biggest moment in F1 history!\nDo people agree? Disagree? Is Drive to Survive season 3 akin to Breaking Bad season 3, and I’m missing some of the greatest TV of all time?!', 'For every girl in karting you have 100 boys competing for a seat in regional series, before you even get into international levels - F1 Academy and Formula W are there to showcase various upcoming talents to help to fund their career as well as serving as an inspiration for future generations, as participation and career in junior series (F3/F2 alone) costs millions.', ""Sophia Flörsch raced in F3 this past season (finishing the season in P29 of 34). I believe that she's the furthest along the F1 ladder at this point. Others have talked about why there are few women racing in F1, and what F1 Academy is for. \n\nThe F1 ladder (or FIA Global Pathway from Karting to Formula One) is the route that the FIA intends for drivers to make it to F1 (though not all steps are mandatory). It was created in 2014, and progresses like so:\n\nAt 15, a driver can start competing in open wheel racing, in the form of Formula 4. Formula 4 has a bunch of national series instead of being an international championship (Italian F4, Spanish F4, etc.). These championships all have the same chassis and power, so drivers can compete in multiple F4 championships in the same year.\n\nThe next step is Formula Regional (formerly kalled Regional F3). These cars have more power, and as the name suggests, encompasses larger areas than the F4 championships. The European iteration of the championship (FRECA) is probably the most frequently referenced championship of the six. There's also the Macau GP, which is a one-off race run on the streets of Macau under Formula Regional rules.\n\nThen you get Formula 3, then Formula 2, then Formula 1. Not all drivers go to F1 the same way. Verstappen skipped F, (as did Stroll), Antonelli skipped F3 and Hadjar spent 2 years in F2.\n\nThat's the general junior progression though."", "">The junior series and it's categories have always been a little confusing for me since I'm a relatively new fan trying to learn about F1.\n\nThe idea is that there is a ladder that you can follow from Formula 4 through to Formula 1. At each step, the cars get more powerful, the races get longer, more elements like pit strategy are introduced, and you start racing at circuits that you probably haven't seen before. It also gets more competitive and more expensive.\n\nMotorsport has typically been dominated by men -- though that's not to say that there hasn't occasionally been a female driver -- so the F1 Academy was created out of the ashes of the W Series to try and get more women into the sport. F1 Academy cars are the equivalent of a Formula Regional car; Formula Regional bridges the gap between Formula 4 and Formula 3. I know it's confusing, but that's just how it is. The thinking is that female drivers can stand out in F1 Academy and that will make it easier to get into Formula 3 and from there into Formula 2.\n\nThere have been a few female drivers in these categories in the past. Sophia Floersch raced in Formula 3 in 2020, 2023 and 2024, although she won't be racing in 2025; she's moving to Indy NXT, which is Indycar's feeder ladder. Tatiana Calderon raced in Formula 2 in 2019 and 2022, although the general consensus was that she had no business being there. And Carmen Jorda raced in the GP3 Series -- the forerunner to Formula 3 -- in 2012, 2013 and 2014, but she was arguably worse than Calderon.\n\nThe challenges to getting more women into Formula 1, Formula 2 and Formula 3 are two-fold: money and talent. First of all, drivers have to be able to secure a budget to get into these categories, and we're talking hundreds of thousands -- if not millions -- of dollars in sponsorship. And then you need to have the talent to stand out and to keep standing out."", ""Because motorsports is (mostly) a meritocracy. You're good, you get ahead. You're not, you get nowhere. Connections and especially money certainly can help get ahead, but it's not enough alone. If I had to quantify it, I'd say connections/money can get you 5% there, maybe 10%. The other 90-95% is merit. If you don't have what it takes, no amount of money will help you. For example, there were Latifi and Mazepin, the two lowest rated drivers in recent history. Well, as bad as they were in F1, they were still at least top 5 in F2 with race wins. Not particularly strong results, but not unacceptably bad either.\n\nNo woman can replicate that right now and it's debatable if it's even possible. I know it's a hard pill for some people to swallow and they act like it's an attack on women, but it's not, it's just the truth: F1 requires immense strength and endurance, which are two things men are MUCH better at. Our bodies are not the same. Men are better suited for it.\n\nA woman ever comes along who can race on a top level, she will get a seat in F1.\n\nPS: there is a woman in F3, Sophia Flörsch. She might not be particularly fast, usually lurking around P18-20, but she definitely deserves respect for racing among the men instead of choosing the easy (and fully meaningless) option, which is F1 Academy. F1 Academy is lower level than regional F4s. Flörsch could absolutely decimate the entire field, she could win everything there. But it'd be worthless."", 'There used to be a mega torrent with pre/post race shows - as well as searching for smcgill1969 on your favourite torrent indexer, who used to do uploads of full sky broadcast of the weekend.']",0,20,0.5,0,19,19,0,6,0.0,0
