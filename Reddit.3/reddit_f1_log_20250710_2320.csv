It's all the fluff around it that's bad."", 'Go W16 and just have the whole grid set a billion dollars on fire.', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **Mohammed bin Sulayem is once again pushing for new engine regulations. A few months ago, the FIA \u200b\u200bPresident wanted to bring the naturally aspirated V10 back into Formula 1. Now there\'s a new idea. Furthermore, a twelfth F1 team could emerge.**\n\n> It was one of the most controversial political issues of the current Formula 1 season: the engine regulations for the upcoming season. Next year, there will be new power units. The electric component will increase to almost 50 percent, while the rest of the power will continue to be generated by the conventional 1.6-liter V6 turbo.\n\n> Since the start of the season, several teams and engine manufacturers in the paddock have been pursuing a policy against the new rules. Ferrari and Red Bull in particular are leading the way. Both top teams are apparently concerned about falling behind Mercedes on the powertrain side. Ferrari team principal Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur and his Red Bull counterpart Christian Horner have advocated for a V10 comeback.\n\n> Both the Frenchman and the Englishman walked through a door opened by the current FIA President, Mohammed bin Sulayem. In February of this year, he announced that the team would be using synthetic fuel starting in 2026 anyway. This would have addressed the sustainability aspect. A return to the loud, screeching V10 naturally aspirated engines, so popular with fans, would be an option.\n\n> Bin Sulayem likely hoped to increase his popularity in Europe with this move. His first term ends in December 2025. He is seeking re-election as FIA President. He doesn\'t have many fans on the Old Continent.\xa0Since the Silverstone weekend, he has had a rival candidate\xa0in the race for the position: Tim Mayer.\n\n> **Engine meeting in Bahrain fizzles out.**\nThe V10 issue escalated so quickly that an engine meeting was called for the fourth Bahrain Grand Prix in mid-April. Bin Sulayem, F1 boss Stefano Domenicali, and the power unit manufacturers were present, as were the power unit manufacturers, who presented their positions. Mercedes and newcomer Audi declared that they would have no engines for next year if the regulations were changed to naturally aspirated V10s at short notice. The proposal was rejected.\n\n> A few months later, Mohammed bin Sulayem is now upping the ante. He told the news agency Reuters: ""The current engines are so complicated and very expensive. The research and development costs reach $200 million (around ‚Ç¨170 million), and the engine costs about $1.8 million to $2.1 million.""\n\n> The 63-year-old is therefore emphasizing the advantages of the simpler naturally aspirated engines. Unlike in Winter, however, he is now offering a naturally aspirated V8 as an option. According to the FIA \u200b\u200bPresident, this should be half the price of the current and future engines.\n\n> The new engine regulations are actually designed to run for five years. However, there\'s the possibility of shortening the interval. Naturally aspirated engines could return in 2029 at the earliest. ""We have to do it quickly. It takes three years, so hopefully we\'ll have something by 2029,"" Bin Sulayem insists.\n\n> **Will a twelfth team come from China?**\nIn addition to the engine issue, Mohammed bin Sulayem also commented on a possible twelfth racing team in the premier class. After Cadillac fought its way into the championship against the wishes of the established F1 teams and will enter the race with a Ferrari engine in 2026, another newcomer is expected to join, according to the former rally driver.\n\n> ""The time will come when we believe it is right to reopen a bidding round,"" said Bin Sulayem. The twelfth team should come from China, the FIA \u200b\u200bPresident explained.\n\n> Would the existing racing teams welcome this? Hardly. The team\'s payout fee would be reduced because more parties would get a piece of the pie. This was already a major contentious issue in the Cadillac case. Only after the US Congress launched an investigation into Formula 1, because the Americans considered the reasoning for its rejection to be unlawful, was Cadillac granted entry into the premier class.', ""Ben Sulayem did make a good point about the environment. He said that electric and sustainable fuels are two ways towards the same end goal - meaning we need to reduce carbon emissions, and that how we do it doesn't matter as long as we hit the target"", ""I don't see either a V8 or V10 happening any time soon. Engine manufacturers have basically no interest in developing big engines, so doing this would cause most of them to leave instantly.\n\nI could see it maybe in enough years that EV tech is far enough along that engine makers are willing to have some pet projects, but for now I just don't see anyone being willing to do it."", 'I‚Äôve always wanted no set engine requirement.

Apologies for being a bit late to the party since the Festival itself has already kicked off earlier today, but since all the stream recordings will stay up (and you can rewind the broadcast back to the segments you missed plus each day gets a full replay before the next one begins), I thought folks would still find this thread useful.

For all the information below I checked the official social media accounts and website for Goodwood and the F1 teams, and unfortunately some just straight up had no info about their participation at the event (at least not yet).

At what point has the flow of time changed cars to the point that comparing drivers becomes foolish? For instance our original conversation started with the question: 
‚Äúcan Jim Clark be called the goat of F1 when he drove a version of F1 cars that didn‚Äôt even have downforce‚Äù

But one could pose the question saying the same thing about Senna, because his car didn‚Äôt have the technology requiring the level of multitasking today‚Äôs drivers have to deal with.

So my full question boils down to, were Clark, Senna, Schumacher, and Hamilton even champions of the same sport? Why even compare them in the first place? Because realistically, with a few exceptions of maybe some of the similar era cars. Most of them wouldn‚Äôt be able to drive each other‚Äôs cars with the same degree of proficiency.
","[""Congratulations! You've successfully achieved the higher level of F1 fandom where you realise trying to compare drivers across vastly different eras is inherently meaningless.\n\nAll you can really do is compare drivers to their peers of the time. In that way, Clark really was on a very special level."", 'even comparing drivers across 2 different regulation cycles is hard, doing it across different eras is literally impossible', 'Absolutely agreed. Hamilton and Verstappen are virtually driving a completely different sport to Fangio and Clark. Murray Walker‚Äôs [take](https://youtu.be/CGKsKU0P3oo) at the start of this video has been my view broadly ever since I saw it as a kid. He later says for him Schumacher is his greatest of all time, narrowly ahead of Fangio, but stresses it‚Äôs just an opinion and of course that‚Äôs a perfectly fine opinion to have (backed up by a long career in F1 journalism). For me, the top tier is Fangio, Clark, Senna, Prost, Schumacher, Hamilton, Verstappen in no particular order. I do not know who I would pick if forced, it would probably change every time.', ""You're right, F1 is unique in that different eras are essentially completely different sports. Generally speaking, apart from tactics and the weight of the ball, football/soccer has been the same for decades. Senna wouldn't be as good as Hamilton in today's machinery, and Clark wouldn't have been as good as Senna in 80s machinery. They're all completely different skillsets."", ""It's totally pointless comparing drivers even in the same era who weren't teammates, and even then the driver who's superior in one car might not be in another with different characteristics. There are so many external factors and circumstances that it's really quite pointless to try and come up with any slightly objective ranking. The driver who was fastest at old Spa in the wet in a 60s deathtrap might not be the driver who is fastest at Miami in modern cars. Traction control vs no traction control. Power steering, sequential gears etc. Which combination of conditions, driver aids, tracks are you comparing across. It's nonsensical really.\n\nAnyway, Jim Clark's the best."", 'Welcome to the rational club!', ""Frankly it's impossible.  It's entirely possible that Senna would dominate today but because he never had to contend with the driving load of today's cars we simply will never know.

1lw8fpb,Why does camera cut away from forward angle at the finish?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lw8fpb/why_does_camera_cut_away_from_forward_angle_at/,2025-07-10, Technical,"I was watching Lando‚Äôs onboard during the British GP and just before he crossed the finish and we could see his celebrations it cut away to showing his rear view (the rear wing). 

What‚Äôs up with this? Why do they do it? I‚Äôve noticed it happen with other races too where for specific drivers they cut away just as you want to see something interesting. 

Also, who decides on what angle to show? ","['I may be wrong on this, but I think I read that there is not enough bandwidth to stream both cameras from the car to the TV center. So they cycle between which cameras are streamed. I believe this is mostly automatic, but can also be manually overridden', ""the angle shown on the onboard is chosen by the production team, not so that you can look at it, but so that the other parts of the production team can use that angle on the main feed if they want to\n\nwhenever you watch onboards you need to remember that, even tho you have access to them, they aren't being catered to you, they're just an intermediate part of the production process, and depending on what they're seeing on the telemetry they'll switch to forward or back depending on what they think could be the most useful to the main feed at any time"", 'This likely also has to do with sponsors. Certain moments in race broadcasts can be predicted, like the winner crossing the finish line. And companies like being associated with winners, so pay more for being prominently placed in those shots.', 'I think in this particular instance, there was a problem with the forward view and it kept cutting out, so the switched it.\n\nBut in general they often make quite unfortunate decisions with the onboard selection because they think its better for the world feed, although i often think it isnt actually a good choice. Especially the rearward T-cam is way overused', ""Tv-direction has been abysmal for ages now, with the exception of one or two races. Way too many close ups, rear-facing, wrong angles at the start and in corners, camera's too low, no preparation of overtakes, just the final pass etc. It's very, very bad actually."", 'it‚Äôs the same as how it will switch from front view to rear view if there‚Äôs action going on. the production team can choose which angle to showcase.', ""Only one camera per car can transmit (in good quality) at the same time with the bandwidth they have, so they frequently switch between the views on each car. I *think* what they switch to and when is automated, otherwise we'd often get better views more quickly in some cases."", 'Not sure the flare ""Technical"" is the best for this post.', 'That would make a lot of sense.\xa0 They probably *could* live stream it in very low quality, but instead choose ""clips"" from the onboard to download at higher quality, which is then made available once it reaches a certain fidelity.\n\n\nIf they only need to switch between streams, then it would limit the length of each clip to whatever they could pre-render.', 'This actually used to be the case and changed this year.  If you notice this year the onboard tends to be a little more choppy occasionally like there‚Äôs a slight loss of signal.  This is because it‚Äôs just transmitting more data and falling to do so a little bit sometimes.  \n\nI noticed early in the season when they switched from the rear facing to front facing camera in the same shot and then it was later confirmed by Sam from f1tv in one of the practice sessions']",0,12,0.41,0,11,11,0,0,-0.020000000000000018,0
