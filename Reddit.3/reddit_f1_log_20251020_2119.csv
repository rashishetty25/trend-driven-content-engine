I feel like Austin really showed how Mercedes and Ferrari can become the ""kingmakers"" in this season. You have some of the best drivers on the grid driving absolute shitboxes, acting as on track roadblocks for anyone trying to get a podium. They also seemingly don't understand their own cars, so it's not like Red Bull or Mclaren can easily plan around them. Despite all this, both teams have non-zero shots at podium positions and so they really have the chance to cause upsets.

For me, the extra exciting part is that Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull are in their own constructors fight for second. Every point matters all the way through the top 8, not just for the 3 championship drivers.

I'm wondering if we'll even see a podium with all the championship contenders on it before the end of the season. I feel like it's definitely possible.

Now that the dust has settled in Austin, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will not be deleted since I do not have that power, but I will be very disappointed with you. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!

  
P.S: We've been trying to post this Day After Debrief thread for hours, but Amazon said no. Really hope this finally works","[""Leclerc was the star yesterday. Such a brilliant drive showcasing bold strategy, great defensive driving and keeping a way faster car behind twice. I really wish Hamilton got a podium yesterday. It was his best chance in recent races imo as Mercedes didn't have pace and Piastri was also behind. \n\nYuki had a good race. Really happy he got a good weekend in points. \n\nI had a lot of fun watching Kimi Antonelli. Super fun, happening drive.\n\nNorris also did a great race. He is 14 points behind and he can definitely get this done with his current form.  His car also had a lot of pace. I don't think Verstappen was getting away without Leclerc doing what he did _twice_. \n\nGreat drive from Verstappen. He needed it to power the hopium train and he delivered.  Still a really unrealistic shot that depends more on McLaren than on his own performances."", 'Said this in the daily chat but will post here too.\n\nI am like 97% convinced that Max / Redbull are setting their cars up each weekend for maximum qualifying performance.\n\nThe Mclaren actually looks quite dismal when its in traffic and I feel like Redbull are taking advantage of that and making sure they are at the front at all costs even at the cost of normal race pace. Seems clear air advantage overcomes that deficit.', ""It was nice to see that clean racing between Charles and Lando. They definitely carried this race's excitement"", 'Another Pirelli masterclass in the books. M-S/S-M 1 stop being a viable strategy on a high energy circuit with hot temps, hats off lads.', 'The most worrying part about Piastri is that two races in a row he has fallen behind the person in front by 4+ seconds. It looks like tire saving but then he never makes that time back up before pitting.\n\nSo he just loses 4 seconds and is just nowhere on the 2nd stint after having to pit early to defend an undercut.\n\nHe just seems slow and the tire wear deg delta we thought he has fixed seems to have vanished on him.\n\nHoping he can get it together and it was just a couple of poor races.', ""For as much as hype I had when Hamilton joined Ferrari, this weekend showed how much Charles is still #1 when it comes to overall pace. I don't think Lewis has had a stretch where he's the faster car. Hoping Lewis adapts well to the new regs next year.\n\nAlso, very surprised Ferrari let them race so hard on Charles' in-lap. Silly to see how much time they lost instead of calling to let Lewis ahead."", 'I‚Äôve already sung a thousand praises about Leclerc and so have others; I don‚Äôt have much to add other than that watching him defend is such a joy. He‚Äôs exceptional at positioning his car, you can see it from his starts as well. I‚Äôm also just relieved he‚Äôs getting praise from the general fanbase for this, because there have been a few performances this season where I felt he did a top-class drive but didn‚Äôt get recognition from casual fans for it because of the car being unremarkable or overshadowed (Saudi Arabia, Spa, Monza.)\n\nThe moves and pace Antonelli had after pitting were brilliant and I wonder if he could‚Äôve had his first on track fight with his teammate had things gone another way. If he had this level of performance at the European tracks, his stock would be much higher - it‚Äôs strange how the moment they leave Europe, he‚Äôs the fiery rookie I remember from F4. I hope he can end the season on a good note.\n\nI‚Äôm disappointed in Sainz, but also not surprised? This year has been a rollercoaster and with him becoming more comfortable in the team, we can see him trying old tricks. The problem is, he shouldn‚Äôt trust rookies to make space for him like that. To me it seems like Sainz still has the mentality that everyone he‚Äôs racing is a top driver with years of experience, and he needs to reel back in his expectations for how other drivers will react to his moves. Other than that one silly mistake though, I‚Äôm pleased with his pace and continued improvement with this car.\nAnother underrated weekend from Bearman. He is just so quick when he‚Äôs feeling confident, and nobody can say he doesn‚Äôt have the willingness to risk moves. I‚Äôm excited to see how he grows and one day how he does in Ferrari.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt say Norris had a good weekend per se, because he didn‚Äôt complete the sprint (not by his own fault, but we have no idea how he would‚Äôve done) and he was stuck behind Leclerc for almost 90% of the race. But compared to Piastri, Norris looks like a real WDC contender. As in... Piastri was absolutely nowhere this weekend. With this being the 4th weekend in a row he‚Äôs struggled to make an impact, it feels like he‚Äôs on a mental spiral downward. I know he had this problem last season too but his improvement from the end of last season to the start of this one seemed so big that I didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd have the same issue. Even though I‚Äôm not rooting for him to win it all, I do hope he can find some good results again just to make it a three-way race rather than a two-way race between Norris and Verstappen with him slowly dwindling away.\n\nI‚Äôm surprised people thought of this race as boring. There was action all over the field and Leclerc vs Norris alone had me on the edge of my seat. COTA is my home track and I‚Äôm always proud when we come here because it never fails to deliver excitement in some way.', ""Fuck, I hope my comment goes through haha\n\n\nFerrari were on a roll yesterday with their split strategies, a play that I will put in a good word for, so as long as I watch Formula One. I was very skeptical of the call for Leclerc to start on used softs in particular, but I was proven dead wrong with the combination of how well the stops and calls were well-timed, and how well Leclerc made that strategy work. P3 and P4, for everything that has happened to them, is magnificent and I'll take this immensely\n\n\nSpeaking of Leclerc, this has been one of my favourite Leclerc-centric races since Suzuka 2024, and another race to add to my list of reasons on why Leclerc is fierce and precise when it comes to defending. Dude usually goes to the end of his means when he does so, and without too much LiCo-related issues hindering his race, he was able to hold Norris off for very long. Even when Norris overtook him in those two instances *(and cheers to Bozzi)*, Leclerc still applied pressure to Norris whose race can go so wrong if he doesn't take caution. Driver of the day for me, and I'll be damned if this drive goes under the radar when detailing his accomplishments as a driver\n\n\nSmall shoutout for Hamilton for retaining P4 with a strong drive, and for successfully giving me a heart attack for that puncture. From what I know, he was told to LiCo mid-race so it is evident those issues are still existent. Looks like it is a race-by-race case, and they need to figure out what track specifics can suit their car to maximise the most results!"", ""F1 needs to sort out its tire situation. We consistently are having weekends this year with very low deg and very consistent performance regardless of compounds, which isn't amazing. I understand that Pirelli doesn't love the optics of their tires blowing up or failing or whatever, but there needs to be something changed for the future seasons to make tire strategy more consequential, if at all possible.\n\nLando looked very strong today compared to Piastri. Max looked like 2023. Oscar has had three stinker weekends in a row and is looking rattled- he needs to pull off a win in the next couple weeks to claw back what he's lost. A DNF would be absolutely brutal for his chances, especially with Max looking like a man possessed.\n\nThat said... give me a Ver-Nor-Pia for the next four races and I believe we end up with 1 point separating all three for AD. Fingers crossed, this year has gotten much more interesting."", 'I think we‚Äôve all been waiting for this title race to come alive and it finally has but through Max‚Äôs endeavours. I agree with most of the commentors from the post race thread yesterday, at least one of the McLaren drivers should be out of sight now. This weekend could have come from 2023, that was how clear Mad was. I don‚Äôt have faith in either McLaren driver that they will be able to endure the mental pressure of what comes next, what other driver could be 40 points at this stage but be a favourite.
