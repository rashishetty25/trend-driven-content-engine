1ndq57a,F1 can learn some lessons from WEC,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ndq57a/f1_can_learn_some_lessons_from_wec/,2025-09-10, Discussion,"
I recently dove into the world of WEC and watched several races from this season. I’m very impressed with how well it’s run, especially in terms of safety and the consistency of decision-making from the Race Director.

Full Course Yellow (FCY):
Instead of bunching the field behind a Safety Car, every driver slows to a controlled speed of 80 kph while maintaining their position. The pit lane is closed. This eliminates the need for a VSC and adhering to a delta time. It effectively freezes the race and prevents anyone from taking advantage of gaps under the VSC.

Virtual Safety Car (VSC):
This works the same as a Full Course Yellow, except the pit lane remains open. Again, instead of monitoring a delta, cars are held to 80 kph throughout the VSC. This ensures no one gains an advantage by manipulating the delta.

Safety Car with Wave-By Procedures:
This is an area F1 could easily adopt. While you could argue F1 already has a similar system, WEC’s implementation is far more consistent. Each phase of the Safety Car is predictable and standardized, which provides better forecasting for teams to make strategic decisions.

1ne57q8,What Undercuts and Overcuts Are,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ne57q8/what_undercuts_and_overcuts_are/,2025-09-11, Discussion,"It's become apparent in recent discourse that people use the terms Undercut and Overcut to mean any change in position which happens around a pitstop phase.

This isn't really what these terms mean when discussed in terms of ""Driver X was given an undercut by the team"". etc.

Undercut or Overcut is all about changes in position happening around pitstops precisely because of the timing of the stop giving you a pace advantage on track.

# Undercut -

The Undercut is the idea that pitting earlier gives you the opportunity to gain time on the driver you are battling by being able to exploit fresh tyres. This increased pace over the car out on track on worn tyres might allow you to gain multiple seconds per lap.

**Risks of Undercut  -** The Undercut only works if you can get upto speed quickly and exploit the pace of the fresh tyres. Traffic is usually a big risk for an Undercut strategy as if you have to pass cars you can't exploit the pace of your fresh tyres. The other potential issue is tyre warm up which in F1 usually isn't much of an issue due to tyre warmers, but with hard tyres on cool tracks it can still be a significant issue. Also pitting first means you will have to go longer on your tyres, potentially leaving you vulnerable later in the race.

Safety cars are a huge risk for a driver attempting an Undercut, if you pit first under green flag conditions and then a safety car or VSC comes out your advantage is demolished.

**How to Negate an Undercut -** Having a big enough lead over the car behind can protect you from an undercut, or having the pace to match (or nearly match) the driver on fresh tyres. Otherwise the strategy to defend from an UnderCut is to pit as soon after your rival as you can to negate their advantage. Then the ultimate way to defend from an Undercut is to pit first!

Or, you run much much longer and allow them to undercut you with the intention of passing them later on much fresher tyres.

# Overcut -

The Overcut is the idea of staying out longer than your rival and using the pace of your car and tyres to gain time on them on their outlaps. This also defends from potential safety cars benefitting your opponent over yourself.

**Risks of Overcut -** This only really works if either you have an inherently faster car, tyre wear is next to non-existent or the tyres cars are pitting onto have a signficant warm up phase or are just inherently slower. In F1 it is fairly rare where the Overcut is the preferred strategy as tyres come out the blankets nearly ready to race, but traffic can make the overcut viable. This is something you see more in series without tyre warmers such as indycar.

**How to Negate an Overcut -** Negating an OverCut is all about not pitting too early and ensuring you have good pace on your fresh tyres. If you have a quicker car behind you and fresh tyres are gonna take a while to be upto speed then pitting first is very dangerous and you are going to want to try and outlast your opponent. In these situations sometimes you get a game of ""pit stop chicken"" where they try to goad each other into pitting first.

# Exceptions -

If a driver suffers a slow pit stop for whatever reason and gets passed either by a car pitting earlier or later, that isn't an Under or Over cut. The timing of the cars pitting is not the reason that the positions changed, it was the issues in the pitlane.

Saying a car Overcut or Undercut in such situations is missing the reason for the overtake happening which is entirely the time spent on pitlane, not the timing of the stop.

Thankyou for coming to my Ted Talk","['Key point I miss here, the overcut and undercut can only be executed by the driver behind.\xa0', ""So if you're going for an undercut you ideally want your team to execute a very fast pitstop and for your rival to have a stop that isn't that fast.

What exactly does he mean by this? In an ideal universe he, Will Joseph (and the rest of the McLaren pitwall), and us are all using the exact same definition of under/overcut (and I think the OP provides a very clear one here), but it seems to get a little murky in what Lando means by this request. How could Lando request this and/or his engineer promise it without implying (whether intentional or not) that they would/could ask Oscar to drive more slowly in case the fresh tyres really did have a huge pace advantage? I\'m not sure what I\'m missing here.', 'However, in this case, the order of the pit stop did impact the position at pit exit, as the gap between the cars was only around a second', 'Absolutely, these are terms used to define an overtaking method.', ""The key point with an undercut is that most of the time it's the new tyres that make the difference, not the pit stop.\n\nA fast pit stop helps for sure, don't get me wrong.

1ne4yhl,"Are there really almost no hype for this season’s title battle or my algorithm tricks me into believing that, what are your opinions ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ne4yhl/are_there_really_almost_no_hype_for_this_seasons/,2025-09-11, Discussion,"As title says what do you think ? I’m believing that this championship battle has almost no hype. McLaren is obviously a rocket ship no one can deny that. After 16 races both McLaren drivers individually have more points than any other constructors. Lando is currently 13 points ahead of Ferrari and Piastri is 44 points ahead of them. And they both have same car so they’re equal on that.
In terms of skill etc. I’m believing that Oscar is slightly more talented than Lando but Lando’s experience balances it, so they’re almost equal on that too.
Basically there’s no significant difference for me that effects the battle significantly.

Situation looks like it’s screaming 2016 all over again but nobody is hyped about it. In summer break the gap was 8 points if I remember correctly, it’s basically nothing but why nobody is excited about it ?

For me a big factor is this 

-McLaren intervenes their battle quite a lot than it should be which kills the excitement quite a lot for me. They’re acting like a parent whose twins are competing over something (let’s say exam scores) , they create some boundaries etc. If the situation is indeed like twins competing over exam scores I’d say they’re good parents. Since they don’t let the tension rise etc. but the situation isn’t like that at all. 
In title battles I’ve watched and heard things weren’t that calm, they’d go all out do whatever they can to win which creates a big excitement.

Another thing is we don’t see on track battles between McLaren drivers. Usually for me on track battles creates a lot of excitement they lack that too. Do they ever really had an on track battle for a win this season ? I’d say no they were usually close but not a significant battle they kinda accept their position and move on. It feels like there’s some sort of de facto Multi-21 team order.

Finally I think they lack aggressiveness. If you followed interviews etc. they aren’t aggressive their statements doesn’t feel like they’re fighting for championship instead it feels like they’re in an upper-midfield team that fight for podiums. And you can see that lack of aggressiveness in team radios too. In Monza Lando had a bad pit stop and got undercutted by Oscar because of this, McLaren intervened asked Oscar to return position and Oscar just accepted it. He didn’t resist at all. I get it in radio they said to him it’s payback for Hungary last year but still I don’t get it at all. 

Oscar and Lando are fighting for title this year, situation is completely different than 2024. It’s just so stupid.

Anyways that’s what I think about that.
Do you think that this title race is boring if so why ? 


It’d be nice to read some opinions beside the ones that my algorithm shows me.

Thanks.


","['I think it’s boring because the only possible intrigue is being neutered by McLaren trying to hyper manage driver/team relations out of fear.
