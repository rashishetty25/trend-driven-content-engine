And Max ain't gonna win 15 races in a row, he didn't even when RBR was miles ahead the competition.\n\nSo, in a more realistic scenario, Max would need Piastri/Norris duo to start ending on the lowest step of the podium more often than not, which would require at least another RBR driver to take points off McLaren, or somehow Mercedes/Ferrari also beating McLaren on track more often than not.\n\nI know this is all theoretical, it's just a fun exercise, realistically I don't see that many scenarios given the same luck for all the driver/teams (talking about crashes/dnfs).\n\nedit: FWIW just last season Max won 7 of the first 10 races and had a giant (70 points) gap to Norris, so nothing's impossible, current gap is 59 points after 9 races."", 'How wild is the performance swing for Sauber?

That overtake alone by Charles makes Charles deserve to be ahead of George.\n\nThis wasn’t a case where Mercedes clearly had worse race pace. If George kept track position, i bet on him finishing ahead of Charles. He definitely had better pace than Lewis just didn’t have overtaking delta, as he was always in the 1.5 second zone and both Ferraris had really terrible pace on low fuel at the end.\n\nThere wasn’t too much between Ferrari and Mercedes this weekend but I think Mercedes was overall faster. Mercedes clearly faster in qualifying and then there’ll be some arguments Ferrari faster in race pace but i disagree, George still had great pace despite losing positions and being in the dirty air. If Ferrari were faster, it wasn’t by a bigger margin than qualifying.\n\nSo i don’t understand why you’d rank George ahead of Charles when he finished behind Charles? Especially when there’s a clear poor start from him.', ""I can't believe Rus ahead of Lec and Nor after leaving the door open for both Fer."", ""Ranking Russell P2 makes no sense. He lost out to both Ferraris at the start and only jumped Lewis because of his almost 5 second pit stop. Only jumped Max because of Red Bull's stupid call to Max to give the position back. He also had decent pace similar to the Ferraris. Unless Edd is crediting Russell for Max's red mist, which helped him get that position it's absurd to rank Russell second"", '“he was only 12 seconds behind Leclerc when the safety car was deployed”- I don’t know 12 seconds behind his teammate can be called not disastrous, especially him ignoring Charles also has car issues to deal with, albeit different from Hamilton.\n\n[Source](https://www.motorsportweek.com/2025/06/02/ferrari-reveals-lewis-hamilton-charles-leclerc-nursed-car-issues-in-f1-spanish-gp/) of both cars having issues.', ""Hulk robbed, but controversial placing of Max completely deserved, it isn't often we see someone intentionally ruin their own race."", ""The worst rankings for a race I've ever seen, lol.\xa0"", 'The silliness of Russell P2 aside, how is it possible that one of the reasons Hadjar is ranked highly is that he beat Gasly on the track... but then Gasly is ranked higher than him?
