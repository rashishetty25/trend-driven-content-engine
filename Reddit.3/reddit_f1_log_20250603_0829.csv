How did Nico H√ºlkenberg pull off the Sauber sensation? Why did Red Bull opt for three stops? Did Charles Leclerc\'s strategy pay off? We answer the remaining questions in our race analysis.**\n\n> **Why did Red Bull choose a three-stop strategy?**\nAt the beginning of the race, things were going quite well for Max Verstappen. He overtook Lando Norris in the McLaren in the very first corner and moved into second place. But by lap 12, the Dutchman was already reporting that he lacked grip compared to the McLarens and was soon overtaken by Norris.\n\n> The first pit stop followed on lap 13, switching from soft to soft tires. ""We had already committed to a three-stop strategy,"" said Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. The next service was scheduled for lap 29, with Verstappen getting medium tires. The final scheduled stop didn\'t happen until lap 47. The four-time world champion returned to the track on soft tires.\n\n> ""We had to take some risks to have a chance. And that was the three-stop strategy,"" explained Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko. In terms of tire wear, they were inferior to McLaren in the 29-degree air temperature and 50-degree track temperature. It\'s the signature discipline of the Papaya racers.\n\n> In that respect, it was positive that they were on track until the safety car was deployed on lap 55 following the engine failure of Kimi Antonelli\'s Mercedes, and that they were projecting a podium finish. At one point, they even came very close to McLaren. ""We were closer than we thought until the safety car and did everything right,"" said Red Bull team principal Christian Horner.\n\n> ""The problem was that our tires didn\'t last long enough, and McLaren\'s middle stint was very strong. Our only chance was the undercut with the soft tires at the end."" McLaren was alert and countered immediately. And then had racing luck on its side, as Horner explains. ""The safety car deployed at the worst possible time in terms of our strategy. Max was on eight-lap-old soft tires, which were worn out.""\n\n> The problem: He had no alternatives available. Although he had a new set of soft tires and three used sets of soft tires on his list, one of them had already been discarded due to use in qualifying and the drive to the starting grid. So, only a new set of the hard compound remained.\n\n> The decision: plague or cholera. Verstappen said: ""Maybe it would have been better to stay out. But hindsight is always 20/20."" According to Horner, they would have been eliminated. The hard option, however, was anything but ideal. ""He was really bad in the warm-up,"" analyzed Marko. ""If you take risks, things can sometimes go in the wrong direction.""\n\n> **Was Verstappen‚Äôs collision with Russell intentional?**\nAfter the restart on lap 61, things got heated for Verstappen and everyone he encountered on the track. First, the Red Bull driver slid off the track almost by himself in the RB21 on the hard tires. A few seconds later, he clashed with Charles Leclerc. The two touched.\n\n> The Ferrari driver explained the situation on the home straight as follows: ""It was a battle for position on the track, to get the slipstream of the McLaren. Max wanted to push me to the inside, and I didn\'t want to go there, so I tried to push him off. I tried to push him to the left. There was a little contact, but luckily without consequences. I knew he would have a tough time on the hard tires."" The incident was investigated, but no penalty was imposed.\n\n> Unlike the clash with George Russell in the Mercedes, which began with Verstappen having to leave the track to avoid the Briton, who had attempted to overtake in Turn 1. The team feared that the stewards would impose a penalty on him for gaining an advantage. So they asked Verstappen to relinquish the position.\n\n> But that really riled the 27-year-old. Instead of simply letting Russell through, he rammed into the Englishman\'s car at Turn 5. This resulted in a penalty: 10 seconds, meaning only one point for tenth place instead of a podium finish. Nico Rosberg even called for a disqualification on Sky UK.\n\n> Russell commented on the situation: ""I was just as surprised as you. I\'ve seen maneuvers like this in simulation games and go-karting, but never in Formula 1.""\n\n> Red Bull team boss Horner declined to comment immediately after the race because he hadn\'t yet spoken to his driver. Marko said: ""We didn\'t anticipate that the tires would be so bad during the warm-up phase. There was a certain amount of frustration, which was reflected in the driving style.""\n\n> What\'s annoying in retrospect from Red Bull\'s perspective: After the race, it turned out that Verstappen had been cleared by the stewards for the original offense of ""track leaving."" So, there was no need to order a swap at all. ""It would be nice if the referees would just say: Keep going or give the place back,"" Horner expressed his hope.\n\n> When asked about the intent, Verstappen replied: ""Does that matter?"" Strictly speaking, yes. Because that might have made a difference in the punishment. The Dutchman got off with a 10-second time penalty and three penalty points for his maneuver against Russell. If the stewards had ruled it intentional, it would have been four, and Verstappen would have received a one-race ban. As it is, he\'s still one point away from that. He now has to behave himself until June 30th.\n\n(1/2)', ""Man can steer perfectly around corners in quali mode and gets hailed a god, but cannot brake in time to avoid a collision after giving a place back.\n\nIt was intentional and we all know it, should have been a Black flag (said the same about Vettel Baku - you cannot do this in grass roots so why formula 1 (because it's a drama with less rules)) \n\nBut should be 4 points and race ban since he meant it...

Now that the dust has settled in Barcelona, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will not be deleted since I do not have that power, but I will be very disappointed with you. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').","[""It's a shame Max did what he did... Meant that no one was talking about Hulk smashing it yesterday.... Or Alonso finally getting points."", 'I know all the talk for the next week or so is going to be about Max (and rightly so) but I would like to point out that yesterday was another example of why making the Hard tyre unfavourable tends to make for better racing.\n\nTeams preferred to run the race on faster but highly degrading rubber instead of a running a long stint on the durable but slow C1. The same tyres are used at Bahrain and we see something similar there.', 'Not enough has been said about that start by Piastri.  One of the race starts on the calendar where even just a good start can get you nailed by a good slipstream. He made such an amazing start that he was never in danger of getting a slipstream behind him.', ""What is up with Mercedes Engines and General reliability this year?\n\nBahrain where George's car was falling apart\n\n~~Blewup~~ Throttle issues in Imola for Kimi\n\nBlewup in Monaco for Alonso\n\nSpain- Blewup for Kimi, Carlos was having temperature issues and so did Lando"", ""I'm just gonna comment on some of the other stuff that's been forgotten because of Max's antics:\n\n\nGreat race from Piastri! Poor guy has been totally overshadowed by the drama at the end but he controlled the race perfectly. I really like him and am enjoying the championship fight this year. It feels like it swings each race, I like both Mclaren drivers tbh so I'd be happy if either of them won the title at the end of the year but it sure is close. And Max does somehow keep them honest.\n\n\nHulk - what a drive as well! Where did that performance come from?! On the flip side, ouch for Lewis getting overtaken by him at the end. Ferrari weren't awful by any stretch of the imagination but that must've hurt.\n\n\nAnother solid drive from Hadjar, he really is rookie of the season for me so far this year. I don't want him in the RB lol.\n\n\nRace to forget for Williams, even before Albon was nerfed by Lawson they just had no pace. I know they've spoken of potentially putting more focus into 2026 but I hope this is an outlier for them.\n\n\nAnd I'm sure there will be a hundred threads about this elsewhere but what is actually going on with RB? None of the second drivers are objectively bad, so why can't they make a car that someone other than Max can actually drive? I feel like Max will adapt whatever the circumstances but that's really putting the team (and all the second drivers they churn through) at a huge disadvantage.\xa0\n\n\nEdit - also I'm a bit annoyed that the SC robbed us of seeing how the strategy would've played out, that would've been interesting!"", ""What penalty would you have given Verstappen?\n\nJust out of curiosity, since there's so much discussion about the 10s being too lenient. Stop and go? DSQ? Full-on race ban?"", ""I don't want to hear anything about 'tyres being too soft' or that multiple stops are boring.\n\nBoth Imola and Barcelona turned out to be great races, surprisingly so. Best of the year in many part to tyre and pitstop management.\n\nIt splits out the strategies and makes room for correct and bad calls."", 'stupid question, who was that girl in the bandana from the mclaren garage? the camera keeps focusing on her, again on the podium, is she like family or something?', 'Why is the leaderboard never posted on any post race thread?', 'Max is way too protected, 10s penalty for deliberately crashing into another driver should be a very heavy penalty in that race and a grid drop in the next.']",53,376,0.86,53,1928,1928,1,9,0.0,1

1l1czlu,Built an F1 data dashboard as a side project ‚Äì would love some feedback!,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l1czlu/built_an_f1_data_dashboard_as_a_side_project/,2025-06-02, Technical,"Hi all,

I‚Äôve been working on a side project over the past few months: an F1 data dashboard that pulls together various insights from the current season. I was looking for something that showed more than just the basic standings and helped visualise how the season is progressing. I thought others might find it useful too.

At the moment, the site includes:

- The most recent race weekend (pole sitter, pole time, race winner)

- The full race calendar with upcoming event dates

- Bar charts for driver and constructor championship standings

- Charts showing which drivers and constructors have taken the most pole positions

- The fastest pit stop of the season, including who set it and at which race

- A scatter plot showing average qualifying position vs race finish for each driver

- A line graph tracking finishing positions for the top 5 drivers across the season

The dashboard updates automatically after each race and qualifying session, so it stays current throughout the season. I‚Äôve tried to keep the design clean and simple, aiming to make the data accessible without being overwhelming: it‚Äôs not trying to replace big analytics tools.

I‚Äôd really appreciate any feedback, particularly around what other insights might be interesting to include or ways I could improve the current layout.

Thanks for taking a look. Hopefully it adds a bit of extra context to race weekends.","['Looks nice but the charts are weird on mobile.
