He did an interview where he basically said Lewis is not even a 7 time champion, Michael should hold that record. Here\'s the exact quote: \n\n>""I still feel sorry for Massa today. He won the final at his home race in Sao Paulo, did everything right. He was cheated out of the title he deserved, while Hamilton had all the luck in the world and won his first championship. Today, I would have handled things differently. That\'s why, for me, Michael Schumacher is still the sole record world champion. Even if the statistics say otherwise.""\n\nHe then went on to describe how he and Mosely knew about Crashgate sooner than previously known. \n\nAnd since this interview was published in 2023, Bernie has said: 1) he didn\'t remember doing the interview, and then 2) okay he did the interview but the reporter is German and misunderstood his English. Not mentioning he\'s given lots of interviews to that reporter in the past.', 'I don’t know enough about lawsuits to know if he has a case, but I fully understand that he’s giving it a shot. Bernie knowing Piquets crash was intentional but not doing anything about it is honestly quite disgraceful and a monetary compensation feels like the least Felipe deserves', "">He isn’t explicitly seeking to overturn the results, but he is seeking over $80 million in damages, among other matters. Additionally, Massa is seeking “a declaration that the FIA acted in breach of its own regulations in failing to promptly investigate the circumstances of the crash in 2008” as well as “a declaration that if the FIA had not acted in breach of its own regulations, it would have cancelled or adjusted the results of the Singapore Grand Prix with the consequence that Massa would have won the drivers’ championship in 2008.”\n\nJust putting this here because there's already people saying he's trying to change the result and that he's suing Hamilton/McLaren."", 'Huge news for f1 podcasts', 'For me the main point of this is that the FIA had proff of wrong doing in time for the Ferrari to contest the race and they chose to hide it, therefore failing in their duty.\n\n\nWe dont know what kind of result should be valid from the Singapure GP and Felipe was robbed of his chance to find it out.\xa0\nGiven what was at stake he might be entlitled for compensation.', ""Even under earlier goals, I don't think under any logic you could declare the entirety of the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix invalid even if a decision was taken back in 2008. At the very most, Renault could have been disqualified from the 2008 Singapore Grand prix with Alonso losing his win but to Massa that would have meant that Hamilton would have been classified as 2nd, making Hamilton win the championship by 3 points over Massa which of course would be against Massa's interests. It would also retroactively take away the dramatic moment of Hamilton passing Glock for 5th place as he'd have only needed to finish 7th (the same position finished to lose out on the 2007 championship).\n\nUnder the above logic, I don't think you could reward Massa compensation for this. Plus, fuel hose could have still got stuck anyway in a normal pit stop. Had it not got stuck and Massa finished in the points then sure, he may have become the champion by Brazil, but that's not on Renault or the FIA."", ""Massa's case is based purely on Bernie Ecclestone claiming that there's a regulation stipulating that the only course of action would have been to void the race but this claim by Ecclestone is absolutely baseless. He completely made it up and then denied he made this statement when he was asked about it again. The reality is that, if anything, an argument about simply disqualifying the team that cheated is the most appropriate action rather than taking points away from all the teams that didn't cheat.\xa0Piquet crashing had zero direct impact on the title fight between Hamilton and Massa. He literally kept his lead over Hamilton after the crash and only lost his lead over Hamilton because his team made a mistake that all the other teams did not make at the pitstop. You can't punish all the teams that didn't cheat for one team cheating just because you messed up which is essentially what Massa's is asking for here. If instead\xa0Ferrari didn't make that error then Massa would have kept his advantage over Hamilton and he wouldn't care at all about voiding the race.\xa0There were also 3 races left in the championship fight after Singapore so everything was still left to race for\xa0and, if anything, Spa 2008 was the biggest miscarriage of justice that year.\xa0\n\n\nAlso, if we are to use Bernie Ecclestone's own words then we should include everything he has said like the fact that, along with FIA President Max Mosley, they both actively helped Ferrari win so maybe we should consider disqualifying Ferrari from both the 2007 and 2008 championships when he was at the helm. Funny how Massa only selectively chooses to acknowledge what Bernie has said though.\xa0"", 'So crashgate caused Masa to pit, which made Ferrari botch the pitstop and left his fuel hose attached.  But if that never happened, then everything is fine?  So really, why doesnt he blame Ferrari for the bobbled pitstop causing him to lose out?', 'I would like to point out the complete stupidity of this case\n\nFirst off lets discuss Bernie as an unreliable witness. Its important to note that Bernie’s claim That he found out about crash gate in Brazil and the right thing to do was cancel the Singapore result completely but they covered it up, was first made by Bernie in I believe 2022/2023 to a  Journalist\n\nThe date is important here as it is after the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi result and subsequent FIA report that effectively said Hamilton was robbed of a World championship due to FIA mistakes .\n\nBernie hates Hamilton, he hates his liberal views and his stance to Human rights issues in places like Saudia Arabia. So it’s well within Bernies modus operandi to suddenly come up with a story that  delegitimizes one of Hamilton’s existing championships at a time when the Abu Dhabi controversy is still ringing high. if you read the Bernie interview the quote comes from there is a lot of Hamilton bashing\n\nWhat I am saying is Bernie lied because he did not like the near universal sentiment (that Hamilton was robbed) that Hamilton was receiving for 2021\n\nThat’s why, now there is a court case, Bernie is now backtracking and saying he can’t even remember saying it – because it’s a load of baloney \xa0\n\nSecondly there is the fact that nowhere in any of the regulations or statutes does it say that invalidating an entire race and removing the results & points is the correct response to a deliberate crash like this. Bernie has plucked this from his own A\\*se.\n\nthe correct thing to do was disqualify Alonso – which I would argue they should have done when it came to light – Ironically this would give Hamilton even more points relative to Massa.\n\nIn Jerez 97 Schumacher deliberately crashed into Villeneuve – Schumacher was disqualified – but the race result still stands to this day.\n\nFinally lets note that the Staged crash by Renault did not intentionally or unintentionally benefit Lewis. To anyone outside of Renault the crash was as random and unexpected as a normal crash and affected Massa and Hamilton in the exact same way, in that they HAD to pit when the safety car came in\n\nHowever when they pitted one pit crew executed a flawless pitstop and one Pit crew majorly f\\*\\*ked up with Massa driving off with a fuel hose attached and this is what ruined his race']",1710,510,0.96,1710,7413,7413,23,4,0.0,23
1oi87gk,FIA reveals no F1 2024 cost cap breaches after wait for results,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oi87gk/fia_reveals_no_f1_2024_cost_cap_breaches_after/,2025-10-28, News,,"[""There's a paywall, so here's the whole article:  \n  \nBreaches of the cost cap can carry major sanctions. In 2022, the FIA’s audit found that Red Bull had exceeded the cost cap in 2021 by 1.6 percent, resulting in a $7million fine and the team losing a chunk of its wind tunnel test time for the following season.\n\nThe wait for the 2024 results to be approved led to speculation in Mexico that there could be a possible breach beyond Aston Martin. In the last two years, when all 10 teams complied with the regulations, the FIA announced the results in September.\n\nBut in a statement issued on Tuesday, the FIA confirmed that nine teams were found to be in full compliance with the financial regulations, with the only exception being Aston Martin’s minor procedural breach.\n\nThe FIA’s Cost Cap Administration (CCA), which completes the review of all team 10s, stated the Aston Martin had “not exceeded the cost cap level, and that the Procedural Breach was of a very minor nature, originated by unpredictable circumstances outside the control of the F1 team.”\n\n[As reported by\xa0*The Athletic*\xa0last week](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6746459/2025/10/24/aston-martin-f1-cost-cap-minor-breach/), Aston Martin still had to enter an Accepted Breach Agreement (ABA) with the FIA to recognize its late submission which resulted from extenuating circumstances beyond the team’s control.\n\nAs the team did not look to gain any advantage through the procedural breach, the CCA agreed these were mitigating factors and decided to award no sanction. Aston Martin will have to cover the administrative costs to prepare the ABA.\n\nBesides the 10 teams, all five F1 power unit manufacturers were found to have complied with their own regulations.\n\nIn its statement, the FIA said reviewing the teams’ submissions was a “particularly time consuming considering both the complexities of the Financial Regulations and the necessity to assess technical aspects (and related cost treatment) of activities of development undertaken by F1 teams and power unit manufacturers.”\n\nLast week in Mexico, when asked about the length of the delay and the possibility of a breach by a rival team, Ferrari team principal Fred Vasseur said it was “not a big deal” to have the results announced this late.\n\n“We have to trust the FIA that they are doing their job,” Vasseur said. “I think it’s not an easy one, honestly. But we also have to avoid making any speculation or rumors. That would be a mistake.”\n\nSauber team principal Jonathan Wheatley was with Red Bull as its sporting director when it was found to have breached the cost cap, and said it was a “very, very difficult thing to balance” for teams.\n\n“You want to be competitive,” Wheatley said. “You want to spend every last dollar up against your cost cap limit, of course you do. That’s what we’re in the business of doing. We’re in racing. We’re in a competitive sport.”"", 'So where did the rumors come from there was a major overspend?', 'weeyums free from the allegations thank god', ""OP's username is pretty funny in this context."", 'Some very respected journalists claimed to be in the know about this fiasco and made comments this is the funniest outcome', ""Good.

If Max hadn't hit the kerb and been on a consistent line throughout, there would be a much better argument that Lewis should be able to predict this and adjust accordingly.\n\nIf you look at the lap 5 vs lap 6 telemetry, Max also braked 44 metres later. In a braking zone of around 209 metres, that's pretty substantial (21%).\n\nI'm happy to be corrected but I thought the guidelines specifically referred to who gets room on corner exit too.

I want to try some modeling on high-density data. (Ok, to be honest, I want to do high-performance computation on low-level hardware(i.e my laptop) to test how good I can get, but financial data generally isn't available and I don't want to do computer vision/media stuff. I like F1 and think it would be interesting to see how machine learning fares against classical online algorithms for decision-making—plus I want to know exactly how competent the pitwall is compared to a jank-trained machine. I'd assume they're very good, but I want to see for myself.)

I've seen people post sector times and other data, and I've looked at OpenF1 and similar projects, but to the best of my knowledge:

1. There's no information on car setups and internals (like tire temps, body temps—is that even a thing? Does lower temp improve driver performance? At the very least, in Singapore and Qatar the effect of ""bad"" climate is clearly felt)
