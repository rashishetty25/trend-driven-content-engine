1ngx7oc,Hungary GP Seating Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ngx7oc/hungary_gp_seating_advice/,2025-09-14, Discussion,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm planning to go to my first F1 Grand Prix with my family, and we‚Äôve decided that Hungary looks like a great one to visit.   
  
Since it‚Äôs our first time, I‚Äôm not too sure which experiences are genuinely worth it versus just overpriced extras or even if using the official website is the best choice.

What would you say is the best option? I know the pricier seats generally mean better views, but from a practical perspective, which grandstand gives you the best value for money?","['T1 grandstand, It has the best action and you can still see the start.\n\nI went to watch Bahrain this year at the T1 grandstand and it was filled with action and Hungary should be similar.

1nguibi,Singapore 2017 alternate scenario,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nguibi/singapore_2017_alternate_scenario/,2025-09-14, Discussion,"I've always been curious about what would've happened in singapore 2017 without the initial crash: in qualifying ferrari and red bull were stronger than mercedes, but qualifying pace doesn't necessarily translate to race pace, and let's not forget that the first 35% of the race was in intermediate conditions, a big advantage for hamilton and verstappen.

It looks to me like raikkonen had an insane start from 4th, while vettel, verstappen and hamilton had a similar start to each other, ricciardo started super slow and hamilton overtook him easily, but didn't seem to have any possibility to overtake others before t1.

It's definitely a race I would really like to see if it were possible: raikkonen should've been ahead at t1, probably followed by verstappen, vettel and hamilton, with alonso around 5th, who also had an insane start, but was on full wet tyres, which would've caused problems in terms of having to pit earlier than others.

While difficult, it's still possible to overtake at singapore, especially on the wet, how do you think it'd have gone down without this crash that took out 4 would-be protagonists?","['No need to speculate on this', ""I don't think Hamilton would've posed a problem for Seb. The Merc was stronger in the straights and weaker on the corners, and old Singapore didn't have a long enough straight to capitalise, even more so in the wet. Same goes for Alonso, the engine was too shit to do anything on straights, and anyway the Mclaren car wasn't good enough to properly challenge the frontrunners regardless of engine.\n\nThat start was the most aggressive I've seen Kimi in his entire 2nd Ferrari stint, so idk if he would've kept the lead. If he was P1, and Seb was P2, it's an easy swap for Ferrari to make. If Max was in between them, then ig they would've tried to use Kimi to block Max and give Seb an undercut to overtake (kind of what Merc did to Kimi in Monza 2018). \n\nHonestly in any case without the T1 crash I see Seb winning the race. 2015 and 2017 were his best non-wdc seasons and except Baku he didn't make a major mistake throughout the year"", 'Alonso podium', ""Ferrari 1-2, Hamilton wins by 5 points at the end of the season due to a mechanical failure for Vettel at Suzuka. (Although Hamilton would've tried to sabotage his own title chances at Brazil and Mexico)"", 'Elite reference', ""Yeah, that race didn't happen, so there is no outcome...."", 'Unfortunately I\'m not very experienced with reddit, I suppose I really need to use that ""serious"" tag I heard before in the future, to avoid answers like this, always get some whenever I bring out alternate scenarios that would\'ve been interesting, like suzuka 1990.', ""Baku wasn't a mistake it was more rage. Made for a great race tho."", 'Thanks for the detailed answer, it\'s nice when people answer the topic rather than the standard ""no need to speculate on this"", it\'s a race that would\'ve been interesting, so since we can\'t actually see the version without crash, best thing we can do is making realistic assumptions.\n\nEven though I watched the season, I didn\'t think about this, I think it makes sense: merc was indeed stronger in straight and weaker in corners and so tracks like this would\'ve made it difficult to overtake.\n\nWhen it comes to alonso, I mostly thought about him that race because a podium looked possible without being taken out, but that would still require the crash, I agree that without crash he didn\'t seem to be in for better than a 5th place.\n\nI didn\'t think vettel was likely to win, but I remember he had some good races at this track, would definitely have been interesting to watch him battle with verstappen, hamilton and raikkonen.']",0,16,0.47,0,13,13,0,7,0.02999999999999997,0
1nhb26r,How do you think the ‚ÄúF1‚Äù Car from the F1 movie would compare to an F2 car in terms of performance?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nhb26r/how_do_you_think_the_f1_car_from_the_f1_movie/,2025-09-15, Technical,"As I‚Äôm sure many of you know, to film the F1 movie, they used a modified F2 car that was meant to look like an F1 car. Obviously, the prop car isn‚Äôt going to compete with real F1 cars‚Äîthe R&D is nowhere near the level of even the worst F1 car, the engine isn‚Äôt as powerful, etc. But how do you think it would compare to an F2 car? Like, I read that the bodywork was primarily carbon fibre, and the fact that they were trying to build bodywork to look like an F1 car and at least somewhat fit with FIA F1 aero regulations makes me wonder if maybe it had superior aerodynamics to the average F2 car? And that combined with having the same engine makes me wonder if it would perform above the level of an F2 car, at least around the corners.","['They fitted plenty of cameras in it, that is the reason they choose F2 cars over F1 cars.\n\nSo probably, AXGP cars will much slower than regular F2 cars', 'It would be slower. While the aero they added was ""real"" (i.e. it generated useful amounts of downforce), it was not remotely optimized to reduce drag. So the net result is a car that is heavier and draggier than an F2 car, but using an F2 engine.\n\nSam Collins did an interesting interview with the vehicle coordinator for the movie talking about how they built the cars (including the electric version they used for the pit lane shots).\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Tv\\_W8ZLndM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Tv_W8ZLndM)', ""I reckon it'll be slower. The aero is for looks; I know they had to work a bit to make it drivable but suspect it's not adding much other than weight..."", ""I'd expect it to be worse than F2 cars. I would be shocked if the APX car had properly executed ground effect like current gen F2 cars, and the overbody aero is much less thought through than the 2018 gen F2s\n\nand even if the APX did have more downforce than current F2s, there's no telling how well it handles aero in corners, dirty air or cross winds, or if it has too much drag for what that engine can pull"", 'If you‚Äôre ever near an Apple Store, go do the Vision Pro demo where they have a ride along with Brad Pitt driving the car. It‚Äôs very underpowered and slow. Or maybe that was just Brad Pitts driving. It looked very underpowered as well, barely able to pull through 3rd gear down the straight.', 'Surely worse than an F2 car, probably better than an F3, just because of the higher HPs engine.\n\nBut I bet the handling is shit nonetheless, as the prop cars were made for a completely different purpose than racing.', 'Well, none of the F2 cars are set up for combat, so......', ""I don't have the answer to this, but I'm surprised this post didn't get any engagement"", ""Dunne and Lindblad didn't get the memo""]",0,9,0.37,0,9,9,0,2,-0.010000000000000009,0
