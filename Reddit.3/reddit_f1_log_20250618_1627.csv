Since Imola, at least one driver in a Mercedes-powered car has retired in every race due to PU issues. It's starting to feel like clockwork at this point.

Interestingly, McLaren are the only Mercedes-powered team that haven’t been hit yet. I was on edge the entire Canadian GP—my anxiety levels were off the charts. If they had cut to Kimi or George pulled over with another PU failure, I honestly don’t know what I would've done. 😅

Does anyone have any insight into what might be causing this? It seems odd for these kinds of reliability issues to crop up this far into the regulation cycle. Could it be related to pushing the limits on performance updates? Or maybe it's just bad luck catching up?

Let's ignore the back markers and just focus on the top 4 or maybe 5 teams. In no particular order:

- Mercedes: Russell is proving that he can lead the team in the post Hamilton era and has managed to keep himself a close as possible to the McLarens. The season is still long and for now he can't be ruled out. Antonelli has been super solid so far and his podium shows that he can deliver under pressure. The recent unreliability of the car makes him a bit harder to judge though.

- Red Bull: Max is Max and if you ignore his idiotic brawl with Russell it's fair to say that he has gotten the most out of the car and, same as Russell, has kept himself in the fight. Let's not talk about the second seat.

- Ferrari: Ferrari is doing Ferrari things which, same as in previous seasons, makes this pairing rather hard to judge. Mainly Hamilton. Has he lost the edge? Is he still adjusting? Is he getting swallowed by the usual Ferrari drama? Chuck is doing what he can with what the team is giving him.

- McLaren: easily the strongest pairing imo and the driver standings show that. They have the best car on most tracks and both Norris and Piastri are delivering as expected. On an individual level, neither might be on the same level as Max and maybe Chuck, but they are as close as one can get. Neither have been flawless, of course.

I've noticed a lot of negativity surrounding Esteban Ocon, with people claiming that he has a reputation of not being a team player, didn't deserve his seat, etc. however, I have watched a few of his interviews and he seems to be a humble, genuine man. if you disagree on certain points, I would love to hear your reasoning and am open to discussion.

**pierre gasly**

it's quite obvious that the two are not best friends and are never going to be, but nobody knows the full story except the two of them. Pierre is the only one that has shared his side of the story, so we never will know exactly what happened and we can't jump to conclusions. Pierre blamed Esteban and that's pretty much the only information we have about their rift. that doesn't mean the fight wasn't necessarily Esteban's fault, also that we shouldn't just assume if we haven't heard both sides. as an Alpine and Gasly fan, I am glad that they worked together professionally.

**max verstappen**

it was obvious that Esteban should have allowed Verstappen to pass instead of trying to unlap himself, and I believe that he was in the wrong for trying to get ahead when Verstappen was clearly chasing the win that day. However, Verstappen's reaction after the race was impulsive and disrespectful. you can be frustrated with a result without crossing boundaries and being unprofessional. I don't understand why people are justifying Verstappen's actions.

**friendships**

Ocon has stated that he is friends with Mick Schumacher and Lance Stroll, the latter being another driver that a lot of F1 fans love to hate (even though we don't know him as a person either). This has led to speculation by some that Ocon only wants to be friends with the two of them because of their fathers' influence. I saw a great comment by u/quantinuum on this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/viunwg/the\_driver\_with\_the\_poorest\_background\_on\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/viunwg/the_driver_with_the_poorest_background_on_the/) explaining how professional and respectful Ocon was when he lost his seat to Stroll.

**background**

I once saw Esteban described as someone who F1 fans say they want to support from a driver they don't want to support. This is clearly represented in his background and the working class beginnings where his career started. Esteban has frequently spoken about gratitude and appreciation to his parents for their sacrifices. meanwhile, I have seen people say things like ""it's a shame that nobody can root for a driver like him"" when acknowledging how powerful his backstory is.

We don't have any idea if it was a genuine decision made to make the movie better- apparently it's still a long movie- or if there was some contract dispute or outside real world conflict.
