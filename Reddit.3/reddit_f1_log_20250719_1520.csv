The inventor, Prof. Malcolm Smith, tells the full story in this interview.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m37jqo/an_insider_account_of_the_inerter_in_f1_from_its/,2025-07-18, Featured,"Hi r/formula1

I’m a professor of Control Engineering, and I happen to know Prof. Smith.

For those who do not know, Prof. Smith is the inventor of the inerter, a suspension device that had a huge impact on Formula 1 in the last 20 years. After its invention, the inerter was secretly used by McLaren since the Spanish Grand Prix in 2005. If you check the results of that year, the impact is quite astonishing. Renault won all the previous 4 Grands Prix. Once the inerter was deployed, McLaren went on to win 10 of the following 15 Grands Prix.

But the inerter became famous only a couple of years after as the mysterious “J-damper” during the 2007 F1 Spygate. Only in 2008, journalist Craig Scarborough revealed that the J-damper was in fact a device called “inerter”, invented by Prof. Smith at the University of Cambridge.

I had the opportunity of interviewing Prof. Smith and go deep into the story of the inerter and his involvement in Formula 1: from a chance call from Williams F1, all the way to the 2022 ban.

The interview is a goldmine of information, some of which is quite technical, while some is more big-picture moments about F1 engineering, innovation, and industrial espionage.

As the r/formula1 is a varied crowd, below I’ve timestamped the Formula 1 bits if you just want the racing side of the story, without the technical explanation. If instead you are into F1 tech and you want to know how he came up with such an idea, what an inerter does, and how it’s different from a tuned mass damper, then watch the whole thing!

I’m happy to answer to some questions below.

You can watch the full interview [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhmLb2DhNYM&list=PLzqux5myRDHWaAWEt1cgI84ZbIheYT3nr&index=4).

So, an F1 team just phones up Cambridge and says, ""Right, we have a problem, send us a PhD to work on it.""  And Williams and the university go into business together to prove out and manufacture the solution.

I’m really glad you enjoyed the video. It was a real privilege to share Prof. Smith’s story. There were actually a few parts we couldn’t include, like how he convinced McLaren to adopt the inerter in the first place.

1m3vut0,"In your view, was the Ground Effect Era a success?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m3vut0/in_your_view_was_the_ground_effect_era_a_success/,2025-07-19, Discussion,"With the new regulations featuring a move away from Venturi tunnels, I want to hear everyone’s opinion on this matter. 

Comparing general field spread from 2017-2021, it has of course been much better across the last four years. 

Racing in the early stages of the regulations (2022 to mid-2023) compared to the 2017 - 2021 era, was definitely better. But the advantage it offered of ‘closer racing’ was relatively quickly nullified for what it promised as cars reached higher levels of downforce again. And according to multiple drivers it’s back to pre-2022 levels of dirty air again since 2024. A promised advantage that barely lasted 2 years really.

Not to the mention the exaggerated spray from the floors and how it affected wet racing (or rather the lack of wet racing). There’s also the weight issue with cars weighing almost 800kg (Multiple drivers mentioning how it affected handling and general racing)

So I ask you, do you think the ground effect era was a success or rather a step in the wrong direction?

And what was your biggest ‘issue’ or ‘problem’ with this set of regulations.","[""I think it underdelivered, but as a fan I can't really complain. Was very interesting nonetheless."", 'The ground effect era imo was at its best in 2022 for about half a season, when it almost completely negated dirty air and allowed for some of the most exciting battles in ages with cars able to follow each other closely. Starting with TD039 we’ve been going completely backwards, although when you look at how many drivers and teams have ended up on the podium across the current regulation set, overall it’d still be deemed as a success. I would also like to call out cost cap and aerodynamic development restrictions as equal enablers of close racing during this era.', 'It is a success in that they managed to make races faster and somewhat more competitive in an 800+kg car over 5.5m long. \n\nFundamentally this is the problem. The car needs to be smaller and lighter (IMHO). Easy to say and hard to do given the competing requirements of cost, ""road relevance"", raceability, safety and overall speed.', ""The biggest problem was that they simplified the suspension. With a more complex one, most of the issues would have been solved, and raising the floor wouldn't have been necessary."", 'The word “porpoising” got annoying really quick.', ""Every car is usually split by a second or so in qualy the cars are far closer together overall, we've seen every team get double digit points so far which is good. \n\nTheir hasn't been a big title fight until this year and the Max domination did get boring but overall big success! Sport is so popular now it's wild"", ""Contrary to most opinions here, I think it has been the best of the 3 formulas of the turbo hybrid era. Field spread has been much closer, we've had a great variety of winners, and there's been more potential for close battles.\n\nIt's definitely not been perfect, as often happens, they've optimised their cars to the detriment of good racing, but I've enjoyed watching 2022-2025 much more than I did 2014-2020."", 'No, it was a failure.  \n\nThe idea was that ground effects cars would be less subject to ""dirty"" air and be able to follow closer and pass easier.  That has not been proven to work.  They have the same problems with dirty air that previous generations did and they also have the ride height issue / porpoising.', ""The ground effect era had the same fundamental problem of every F1 ruleset, in that one team totally nails it out of the gate and has a period of utter dominance resulting in predictable races, then slowly the field catches up.\n\nAnd what happens when you finally get to that period of close racing up and down the grid? They change the rules and the same thing happens all over again.\n\nIf it was up to me I'd just leave the rules alone (except where required for safety). F1 engines will never really be relevant to road cars, keep them simple and if insufficient engine manufacturers want to get involved make the engines a spec item like they did with tyres, there's plenty of other areas to innovate.""]",72,72,0.87,72,67,67,66,51,0.16000000000000003,66
