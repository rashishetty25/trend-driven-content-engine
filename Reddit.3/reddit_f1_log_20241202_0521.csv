However, as precedent shows, it appears to be the standard penalty for ignoring double yellows during a race. I went through the penalty-points system database which covers the past 10 years, and found all three instances of a breach **during a race**.

* 2021 Austrian GP, Mazepin & Latifi handed penalty post-race, **10s Stop & Go**, which was translated into 30s added to their race time due to the penalty being post race. ([Source](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/mazepin-and-latifi-handed-post-race-penalties-for-failing-to-slow-under.6f8SGWq4WlOkeAdh3ff1T))
* 2017 Belgian GP: Raikkonnen handed **10s Stop & Go** for ignoring double yellows.([Source](https://www.racefans.net/2017/08/27/raikkonen-given-penalty-points-yellow-flag-error/))

These are all examples I could find of drivers ignoring double yellow flags during the race in the last 10 years. All drivers got the same penalty.  If anyone could find examples from before 2014, that would be interesting too.

At least this time, the stewards seem to have been consistent for once.","['Maybe the confusion comes from that it has happened more often during qualifying in recent years and with different penalties for qualifying', ""It's confusing to fans because the broadcast makes no distinction between single and double yellow.  It's just a yellow flag notification and what sector."", ""Yup. We haven't seen it in a race in a few years, only really during quali & practices, where it's a 3 place grid drop. And during VSCs and SCs it's a 5 second penalty."", 'I actually thought the FIA were right in issuing strict penalties. Their only failure was the wing mirror being let out on the track for so long.\xa0', ""Penalty today was fair and consistent\n\nI think the issue actually is that drivethrough and stop and go penalties aren't given often enough. They should be utilised much more for collisions when one driver is clearly at fault instead of standard 5/10s penalties. The only reason the penalty today seemed harsh at first is we basically never see stop and go penalties."", ""It's a safety issue and a very fair penalty imo, same with the pitlane one"", 'There have been very rare instances of ignoring double yellows that not everyone remembers the rules. But what surprised me was that the commentators overreacted to the penalty. Even after the race where they had time to cool down and do a bit of research before the post race presentation, they kept repeating how both the penalties were harsh and FIA has to be blamed.', ""Most people don't care to look details and nuances, they just want to be angry!\n\nThe other talking point of today's race was Lewis's penalty. A drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane seems harsh because they usually give 5-second penalties. But the significant factor in this case is that Lewis was 12.5 km/h over the speed limit, not the usual 0.1 km/h. And a drive-through penalty is the recommended penalty in regulations when you are that much above the speed limit.\n\nFor Lando's case as you said 10-second stop-and-go penalty is standard for not respecting double yellows in the race. I think a lot of people are not paying attention to the fact it was **DOUBLE** yellows not single. Again 10-second stop-and-go penalty is the recommended penalty in the regulation (Bernie Collins confirmed that in post-race) and as you said it's the penalty that has been given in all recent instances.\n\nEdit: I think the broadcast also plays a part in the misunderstanding, firstly they showed the wrong replay in the live broadcast and they just said yellows in the race, didn't say double yellows until post-race."", ""It seemed harsh at the time but there's clearly precedent for it. People complain about stewarding but they get it right more than they get it wrong. It's race direction that's been an issue sometimes and was a huge issue today.\n\nThey gave out loads of penalties today and they were all pretty fair""]",624,136,0.93,624,123,123,68,4,0.010000000000000009,68

Hamilton can also be heard reporting a puncture while on the pit straight well before reaching the point where the mirror was hit by Bottas. (Please note that on driver cams, the radio is out of sync with the video, but you can tell when radio calls are made by watching the driver toggle the radio on their steering wheel.)

The debris appears to mostly fall on the RIGHT side of the track, off the racing line, and both Sainz and Hamilton report front-LEFT punctures. It's possible there was some other debris from when the mirror initially fell off the car, but it seems possible, if not likely, that these punctures were unrelated to the mirror debris.

",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h48zur/following_the_qatar_grand_prix_lando_norris_has/,2024-12-01, Statistics,"Lando Norris has secured the first Fastest Lap Award of his career. It's also McLaren's first time winning it (and the first time a team other than Ferrari, Red Bull or Mercedes has won it since its introduction in 2007). 
 
**How did Norris win?**

Going into the race, Norris was leading the contest with 5 fastest laps (FL) to his name, followed by Verstappen and Leclerc tied in second place with 3 FLs each. Leclerc was already out of contention because of tiebreakers (second most fastest laps, then third most fastest laps if needed and so on). With Norris setting the FL in Lusail, it's now mathematically impossible for Verstappen to match Norris' tally and hope to win on countback.

**Previous Fastest Lap Award Winners**

- 2023: Max Verstappen 
- 2022: Max Verstappen
- 2021: Lewis Hamilton
- 2020: Lewis Hamilton
- 2019: Lewis Hamilton

**Random facts and stats about the Fastest Lap Award**

- The FLA was won on countback 4 times: R√§ikk√∂nen over Massa in 2007, Vettel over Webber in 2009, Alonso over Hamilton in 2010 and Hamilton over Verstappen in 2021.

- 2010 was the only season in which the team with the most fastest laps didn't win the FLA (Alonso won it on countback over Hamilton, but McLaren had 6 fastest laps in total to Ferrari's 5). 

- Mercedes holds the records for most FLA wins (8), most consecutive FLA wins (8) and most consecutive fastest laps in a single season (7, set in 2014 between the British GP and the Japanese GP).

- 88% of the teams fielding the FLA winner have also won the Constructors' Championship the same season (exceptions being Brawn in 2009 and Red Bull in 2010). 

- 61% of the drivers who have won the FLA also won the Drivers' Championship the same season (exception being 2008, 2009,2010,2011,2018,2021 and 2024). 

- In 2008, Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen and Ferrari set the following FLA records:

-Most fastest laps by a driver in a single season (10)

-Highest % of fastest laps by a driver in a single season (55%, 10/18 races)

-Most consecutive races with the fastest lap by a single driver (6) 

-Most fastest laps by a team in single season (13)

-Highest % of fastest laps by a team in a single season (72%,13/18 races)

I know that FIA is in charge of the governance, rule creation, circuit certification etc but F1 is a big sport with big money. Those are relatively simple tasks that can definitely be solved with money.

The sport is enjoying a boom in popularity right now but FIA doesn't play any role in that. If anything, their presence could potentially harm this popularity for the long term.
