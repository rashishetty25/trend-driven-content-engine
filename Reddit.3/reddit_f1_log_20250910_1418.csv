**Fernando Alonso:** I remember once South Korea in 2010. It was a red flag in the middle of the race. It was very wet, aquaplaning everywhere. We stopped on the grid and it was Mark Webber first. I was second. I came to the, um, to the grid and I spoke with him. You know, the track is really bad. You know, his aquaplaning, it will be a disaster if we restart the race now. And I knew that the race was about to restart soon. He(Webber) said that I entered in his mind that the track was worse than what actually it was. And and he crashed after the restart.

  
**Interviewer:** You wily old devil.

You know, in that day to to really win the race or keep the championship alive a little bit longer.","[""So that's why Max keeps saying there's no grip."", 'If there was one guy who knew how to play Mark Webbers mind that is obviously his good friend Fernando.

He seems to have everything under control at all times.\n\n>‚ÄúHe has a self-confidence I‚Äôve probably never seen before. He‚Äôs not worried about other teams, other philosophies, or other designs. He believes his will be the best.‚Äù\n\n>Alonso said Aston Martin‚Äôs recent struggles were turned around by leadership moves such as Newey‚Äôs signing. ‚ÄúArrivals like Newey have allowed us to reset our expectations and our motivation,‚Äù he said.\n\n>‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt see any change when the situation isn‚Äôt good, then it becomes a problem. Then you lose confidence. But I think what I‚Äôve found at Aston Martin is a team and a leadership that will never be happy until we win.‚Äù\n\n>Alonso recalled Newey‚Äôs visit to Monaco earlier this year. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt talk to many people, but at the same time he‚Äôs always thinking and tinkering with things. The front wing here, the suspension there ‚Äì I think he‚Äôs more of an artist than an engineer.‚Äù\n\n>Finally, the 32-time grand prix winner said he and Newey share a similar mindset. ‚ÄúWhen we‚Äôre motivated, we become obsessed,‚Äù he smiled.\n\nInterview basically confirms that Newey has been tinkering with the 2025 car, as a side-quest.

1nddfd4,What would Formula 1 look like if we had three-driver teams?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nddfd4/what_would_formula_1_look_like_if_we_had/,2025-09-10, Discussion,"Instead of ten 2-driver teams, what if there were six 3-driver teams? What would change?

No hate to either driver, but I think the first thing that could happen would be Tsunoda and Colapinto losing their seats since there'd only be 18 seats (3 x 6) up for grabs which could leave both of them (alongside Doohan) without enough room.

It would also be interesting to consider what the teams might look like:

* **McLaren.** Since McLaren seems to be the most **consistent** team this season, I could see them pairing Oscar Piastri with other reliable drivers like Russell and Albon who are both regularly in the points while outperforming their teammates.
* **Red Bull.** Max Verstappen may end up paired with other drivers who have the raw **pace** to keep up like Norris and Antonelli. This would somewhat make the team the polar opposite of McLaren with higher ceilings but lower floors.
* **Ferrari.** This would be the easiest one since all Ferrari would have to do is bring back Carlos Sainz alongside Leclerc and Hamilton. Sainz scored 290 points last season so, despite his disappointing performance at Williams, he'd likely do quite well if brought back to Ferrari.
* **Aston.** We know Lance Stroll isn't going anywhere but I could see them bringing Hulkenberg in since he's a fellow Le Mans winner like Alonso. This would give the team the **endurance** it needs to perform well on long tracks and unpredictable weather.
* **Alpine.** Pierre Gasly has been overperforming at Alpine (especially relative to Colapinto) so I could see the team adding another Frenchman like Ocon and perhaps even filling the last seat with Lawson for lack of a better choice.
* **VCARB.** Isack Hadjar is already showing great promise at Racing Bulls with his recent podium so they could throw in two more **rookies** such as Bortoleto and Bearman. This would make them the youngest team on the grid with an all-rookie lineup.

Here's what the leaderboard would look like if we use the drivers' standings from after Monza 2025:

|Team|Points|Breakdown|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Red Bull|589|293 Norris + 230 Verstappen + 66 Antonelli|
|McLaren|588|324 Piastri + 194 Russell + 70 Albon|
|Ferrari|296|163 Leclerc + 117 Hamilton + 16 Sainz|
|Aston|99|37 Hulkenberg + 32 Stroll + 30 Alonso|
|VCARB|72|38 Hadjar + 18 Bortoleto + 16 Bearman|
|Alpine|68|28 Ocon + 20 Gasly + 20 Lawson|

This would put Red Bull and McLaren in a very tight battle for the Constructors' Championship.

Of course, it's unrealistic that Mercedes, Williams, Sauber, and Haas would all just disappear overnight.

But if we purely look at those six teams, a pattern starts to form with the top three teams each having a weakest link in Albon, Antonelli, and Sainz. While I predict Albon and Sainz would do better in McLaren and Ferrari than they're currently performing in Williams, I'm unsure as to how Antonelli would fare at RB.

This my first post here y'all so please be gentle lol

1. Both the Aston and the Ferrari are beasts, so I can potentially see one last head-to-head dog fight between Lewis and Fernando. The two drivers that turned me from a casual fan to an F1 diehard, getting the chance at a truly storybook send-off at the top of the sport would be dope
2. Two and Three are connected, but I actually do hope Hadjar gets the ""promotion"" and absolutely kills it. It would be so much fun to watch someone go at it with Max in equal machinery. Max is genuinely one of the most fun and exciting drivers I have seen, and I always felt cheated that Daniel kinda ran from the challenge against him. I think Hadjar is a dog and ROTY, it would be cinema.
3. Because this is a new regulation cycle and all the PUs are brand new, technically, this would be the first year VCARB might actually live up to its ""sister team"" moniker and be on equal footing. If Yuki and Lawson are their drivers, there is a real fun thought experiment that Red Bull can do, the main car can be an aggressive, unhinged monster, while the VCARB can be a more balanced affair on equal PU with no hand-me-downs. Watching them this year has made me excited for the two teams to actually duke it out next year.
4. This is where it goes off the deep end. Both Bottas and/or Checo get podiums at COTA. I think it's cool to have an American works team in the biggest motorsport in the world, and call it bias, but I do think it would be a wonder for the sport for casual American fans to feel they might have a competitive team. I know Haas is also American, but they are, without a doubt, the poorest team in F1, and having Cadillac build an aura similar to the Tifosi would be cool.
5. In my hypothetical 99.99% won't happen dream season, Ferrari and Aston would be fighting out for the WCC. And I pray Williams just comes out of nowhere to beat both McLaren and Mercedes. We have had the same four teams at the top of the pecking order for so long. It would be so refreshing to see a true customer team (I say this just because Williams doesn't make a road car) in the mix. Also, their colors, kits, and drivers just scream Formula 1 to me; they feel Nostalgic!
6. This is a tiny one, but an Ollie/Gabi Podium or win would be dope just coz these two have been so refreshing this season. Ollie has been so impressive; I feel like Ferrari has their driver of the future, and Gabi just has this aggression and feel for the sport that is cool. (This one is definitely just for the vibes)
7. I did the worst math on earth, and the 2026 cars look like they'll be the smallest they have been since 2016/2017, so I'm on my hands and knees begging the universe for more fights. This season has made me feel like all the drivers have been in handcuffs, and I get the feeling they just want to let out. Zandvoort was a pretty good race because a lot of the drivers came back from the break with elbows out

That's it that's the wishlist. I would love to hear everyone's thoughts. I don't think any of these will happen but new season, new regs if this isn't the time for wishful thinking when is.

P.S.: Yes, I am a Ferrari fan, Williams is my midfield team of choice, and watching the king Hulkenberg bring a podium to my favorite backmarker team (I hate kick, Stake and the pickle rick green btw I liled them as Alfa Romeo and Charles is my guy of the current era) brought a tear to my eye.","['I need Williams to build a rocketship and have Alex win the WDC.\n\n  \nI strongly, STRONGLY believe he is a capable enough driver.

1ncomu6,Thought experiment with Oscar v Lando,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ncomu6/thought_experiment_with_oscar_v_lando/,2025-09-09, Statistics,"After last weekend, I decided to run a little experiment. It turned out to be more eye-opening than I expected, because I thought it would confirm something I already believed‚Äîbut instead, it showed me something completely different.

With a little help from AI, I used random number generation to adjust Oscar Piastri‚Äôs form to reflect how he performed last year.

Looking back at all of his finishes from 2024, his average was 5.1 with a standard deviation of 3.0. So the idea was to simulate his current season as if he hadn‚Äôt improved, using last year‚Äôs stats as the baseline. I thought this would create a model where Lando was clearly McLaren‚Äôs number one driver.

My assumption going in was that, if Oscar wasn‚Äôt consistently near the front, Max Verstappen would be seriously challenging Lando and might be ahead. 

Here‚Äôs how I set it up: I left all other drivers‚Äô positions untouched and just dropped Oscar into lower finishing spots based on that statistical profile, promoting the drivers ahead of him. For example, in my model he finished third at Spa instead of winning. There were a few other adjustments like that, but he still only finished outside the points once and even got two wins, which felt realistic.

What I actually ended up with was Lando leading Max by about 70 points. Behind them, there‚Äôs roughly a 60-point gap to George Russell, followed by Charles and Oscar close together, about 50 points ahead of Lewis, with Kimi and Alex another 50 points back.

So what I learned is this: Lando has improved drastically this year, even when you assume Oscar‚Äôs form stayed at last year‚Äôs level.

I‚Äôm Australian, so of course I‚Äôd love to see Oscar win the whole thing, but I‚Äôll happily say this: Lando is fantastic this year. And unsurprisingly, even in this model, McLaren is running away with the Constructors‚Äô Championship.","['There‚Äôs a reason people get degrees in statistics and other fields. \n\nWhat you‚Äôve done is throw darts in the dark to draw a conclusion with no objective meaning. \n\nJust saying ‚ÄúAI‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make something meaningful or correct.\n\nOf course Lando has been good. He‚Äôs one DNF away from being in an extremely close fight for the championship.

It has been well-documented -- both by Piastri and by McLaren -- how he has applied himself to address the shortcomings that he had in 2024, and I think you would be hard-pressed to argue that he has not improved as a result."", 'so you entered data and and lowered oscars finishes to make it "" realistic "" and then deduced that lando has improved, informative.......\n\nDid you know if we lowered all of maxs finishes statiscally yuki has improved', '""With a little help from AI"" girl no', 'Sorry mate.
