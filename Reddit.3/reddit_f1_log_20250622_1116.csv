From there on, Lauda tried desperately to catch and overtake the Hesketh in front of him, but Hunt's top speed advantage prevented any sort of real progress, and unlike earlier in the season in Argentina, Hunt didn't crack unter pressure, winning with a 1.06 second advantage - Lauda's team mate Regazzoni in 3rd trailing the pair by over 50 seconds.\n\nThis was the Hesketh's team sole Grand Prix victory, and it slid into irrelevancy after Lord Alexander Fermor-Hesketh ended his involvement with the team in late 1975, citing lack of sponsorship and affordability.
