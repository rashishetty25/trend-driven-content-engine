1jg233o,TIL about how Chris Amon was possibly one of the greatest and most underrated drivers in F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jg233o/til_about_how_chris_amon_was_possibly_one_of_the/,2025-03-20, Throwback,"When we talk about underrated drivers we always come up with more modern era drivers, but when we think about the older era drivers, I think the biggest name that pops to my mind is that of Chris Amon.

In my humble opinion, Chris Amon was a great and versatile driver who just never had the luck or reliability to win a Grand Prix, and if I may say, if he got to drive with Ferrari in their early 60 era, he may have been a contender for a championship. Ferrari in the late 60s were just struggling to keep up with Lotus, Brabham and Matra International (future Tyrrell) so getting podiums quite consistently was an amazing feat by Amon.

He was also very capable of doing great with a newcomer such as March in 1970, being able to finish at the podium a three times (2 second places and one third) that season (although the 701 was quite a competitive chassis overall). Even at his brief stint at Matra in 1971 and 1972 he was able to get two poles (1971 Italian GP and 1972 French GP) with a car that was just not as good as before.

To sum it up, Chris Amon is not talked about much due to how long it has been since he last competed in F1, but his record shows how much of a wasted talent he was, maybe if he got a seat at Lotus in 68' he could have won a race ir maybe a few more, we will never know how good this man truly could have been.

And to quote Mario Andretti on how unlucky Amon was: ""if he became an undertaker, people would stop dying"", or even legendary Ferrari engineer Mauro Forghieri: ""by far the best test driver I have ever worked with. He had all the qualities to be a World Champion but bad luck just wouldn't let him be"".","['If you were a Kiwi, your dad would have been telling you this ever since you were old enough to remember. \n\nFun fact: Brendon Hartley is the second unluckiest driver.', 'Really was the best part of that late 60s Ferrari team.

We may have lost Eddie, but we at least have that to look forward to.

People who knew him, or even those who had never met him, will be keen to add to what he said, or who he was, or what he did for them. None of them will say he was an awful person, or that he didn’t care, or that there was some malice lurking beneath that gregarious exterior. Indeed, there was no boundary between his exterior and his interior. Eddie was unashamed of who and what he was. We all envied him his lack of restraint, even though it could make you wince with embarrassment on most occasions.

Eddie was a Tigger, ‘T-I-G-G-E-R!!!!’. He bounced from place to place, never resting. He had the energy of a nuclear power station. He was to social convention what a wrecking ball is to a tower block. He just didn’t care for stupid rules and niceties. He’d cut the ‘crap’ right out and be alarmingly direct and familiar without ever being impolite.
