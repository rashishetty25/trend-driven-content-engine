Poached from Aston Martin on February 17, 2022, he will have only experienced 38 Grands Prix with the Enstone team . Brunon Famin, his replacement, had a one-year interim, logically shorter, but still longer than Oliver Oakes\' ten months on the pit wall.\n\n>The ejection seat of the Alpine principal position never left enough time for a single decision-maker. Between July 2023 and May 2025, the team had more different team principals than regular drivers. This lack of stability has seriously hampered the team\'s development in its quest for results in Formula 1 .\n\n>The 60-year-old Romanian-American was not helped by Luca de Meo, then head of the Renault group , and his demands for short-term results. ""I only spoke to him three times , "" he confided in an interview with The Race. ""  At one point he was very enthusiastic about poaching me from Aston Martin. He told me he needed someone with F1 experience. He seemed keen to do things right.""\n\n\n>Szafnauer joined Force India in 2009, when the team was sitting second to last in the standings with no points scored at the end of the previous season. He contributed to the team\'s gradual comeback, climbing the standings each year: 7th in 2010, 6th in 2011, 2012 and 2013, 5th in 2015 and 4th in 2016 and 2017.\n\n>Bought by Lawrence Stroll and renamed Racing Point in 2018, the team even achieved its first victory with Sergio P√©rez\'s comeback at the Sakhir Grand Prix in 2020. This performance was confirmed once the team moved to Aston Martin with a podium finish for Sebastian Vettel in 2021 in Baku (then a second in Hungary) and nine for Fernando Alonso in 2023.\n\n>Szafnauer will not have had the same opportunity at Alpine, in particular because of Luca de Meo\'s expectations. ""The last time I spoke to him was in Montreal in 2023 [four rounds before his ousting in Belgium, Editor\'s note]. I explained to him that it would take time to implement a paradigm shift within the team. I told him how long it would take, to which he replied, \'I don\'t have that time. It has to happen faster.\'""\n\n\n>‚ÄúBad decisions by management always cause bad results on the track.‚Äù\nOf all the recruits Szafnauer made at Alpine, a large majority only stayed with the team for a few months before moving on. ""There\'s a great aerodynamicist from Red Bull , I think he\'s the only one still there , "" he recalls . ""My other recruits ultimately didn\'t come or left after only a few weeks. One of them was leading Apple\'s simulation program in Cupertino, among the best simulation engineers in the world.""\n\n>A resentment relieved by the difficulties encountered by Alpine since his departure, which Szafnauer almost welcomes. ""I\'m not pointing out anything that people can\'t see for themselves ,"" the Romanian-American exonerates himself. "" You only have to look at the constructors\' standings: they\'re last this year. It just shows that bad decisions by management always cause bad results on the track.""\n\n>The Italian\'s recent surprise resignation from his post as Renault Group CEO came as a surprise to Otmar Szafnauer. The manufacturer\'s sales were ""doing well,"" and the CEO reportedly negotiated a ""four-year contract extension"" with the diamond brand. Renault and Alpine\'s future in F1, he said, remains ""in the hands of the new guy. When Carlos Ghosn was there, he made the decisions for F1. Maybe [Flavio] Briatore is right and it won\'t change anything at all, I don\'t know.""\n\n\n>Amid rumors of Alpine\'s sale, given its recent performance, the Romanian-American can only point to the brand\'s philosophy and the team\'s financial results: ""I think Alpine will only sell electric cars in the near future. So there\'s not a big correlation between track and production vehicles,"" he comments. "" Maybe they\'ll say, \'We bought this team for next to nothing and it\'s now worth a billion and a half. Why not sell?\'""\n\n>Coming from a former team manager claiming to be supported by a manufacturer for a new team project, the message seems almost inciting.', ""When asked about this Mr. de Meo had this to say: \n\nHe wasn't corrupt enough."", '>I explained to him that it would take time to implement a paradigm shift within the team.

Just tell me how many simultaneous pregnant women the team needs and I\'ll make it happen, damn it.""\n\n>""My other recruits ultimately didn\'t come or left after only a few weeks.

So lotus ran with 1 and 2. Tyrrell finished second in 73 so took 3 and 4 for 1974. Tyrrell kept those numbers until the 1990s. 

McLaren finished third and so took numbers 5 and 6 for 1974

And so on. 

Questions: at what point did Williams get car 5/6?

And why did Ferrari get numbers 27 and 28? Going by 1973 standings they‚Äôd get 11 and 12 in 1974

","[""I'm sure someone else will come in with concrete dates, but I believe there was a time when Ferrari paid lower positioned teams so they could run a consistent number, although I forget which years they did this"", ""The way this worked is that the WDC's team got #1 and #2 and gave its previous numbers to the previous year's WDC team.\n\nFerrari did start out with #11 and #12 in 1974. Scheckter won the WDC in 1979, stayed with the team so Ferrari had #1 and #2 in 1980. Williams (Jones) who had #27 and #28 won the WDC that year, so they were #1 and #2 in 1981 and Ferrari got #27 and #28 from them.\n\nInitially Lotus had #5 and #6 and exchanged those numbers with Brabham in 1979 (Lauda was #1 in 1978, Andretti in 1979).

Baku, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi, Abu Dhabi (5 races)

China, Japan, Singapore, Australia (4 races)

Canada, Mexico, Brazil, US x3 (6 races)

[Rightly] lots of Europe (9 races)

These now look like 4 logical race series that make up the world championship. A European series, an American series, a Pacific Series, and a West Asian series. If the fixtures were shuffled so that these blocks were run consecutively, the logistics would get cheaper and the environmental impact would be lower - but I think it has more potential to generate interest in ""continental"" points/trophies. Winning all 4 series in a year would be a ""Grand Slam"" season for a driver/team - a more challenging thing to achieve than ""just"" taking the world title, especially for drivers in leading teams with a fairly evenly matched driver in the other car. 

There would be 4 end-of-series races that are much more likely to be a down-to-the-wire points shootout than the final race of the season is. Teams not in title contention could split their 2nd seat between drivers to hire a local and boost interest / sponsorship. There's another set of sponsorship opportunities for the series themselves too.

They flew out to Bahrain for testing. Back to England. Australia. Back to England, China, England, Japan, England, Bahrain, England etc etc etc.', 'So you are proposing that everyone stays on the road for 3/4 of the season.', ""I don't know if it's still true but they used to have two sets of equipment which is why they alternate often between continents. One set is shipping as the other set is in use."", 'Grouping races together is not more sustainable since it means the freight has to be flown instead of shipped to meet the timescales of races being next to each other in the calendar.\nThere are multiple sets of freight and the calendar is currently organised to try and minimise freight flights.', 'No. It is too different than the current F1 format. \n\nThe logistic of F1 are well documented. I doubt the logistic saving are something the teams care about. It is pocket change for them. \n\nThe format seems nice on paper. Europe is much well connected than the rest. America is really large. Probably a travel from Europe to US is cheaper than from Brazil to Mexico. Similarly Eastern Asia, Australia Singapore.\n\nThere are several F4 series around the world. Local sponsors would put some money, but not a lot. Participants drop some series because they are too far and too expensive to cover costs.', 'Here\'s the positives. I like the idea about hyping up different things in a Grand Slam type way. But, like with golf and tennis, a grand slam doesn\'t mean they\'re together in the calendar, it generally means throughout the calendar, so I don\'t think it would need to be for this either. There could be regional leaderboards for driver and constructor. Note that Africa might be added, so that would have to be given a region. South Africa doesn\'t exactly fit geographically with anything else, but that doesn\'t mean it shouldn\'t be added to the calendar. If something was going to by hyped up with separate leaderboards, I think rather than location, street circuit vs road course could be it. There\'s a lot of middle ground honestly in F1, and some ""street"" circuits are actually more like traditional circuits, because some are purpose built, but they could assign them.\n\nScheduling alone is a difficult mathematic problem. Venues have other events. There\'s weather patterns to consider.\n\nThen there\'s the thing people here never talk about. Monza and Imola have been very far apart in the calendar for good reason. Because I\'m sure it\'s one of the more likely races for people to go to both of. If you had them on back to back weeks, don\'t you think more people would go to both? Spa and Zandvoort are on opposite sides of summer break as well.\n\nYou might say, yeah, that make sense, we can jump around Europe because everything in Europe is close enough together, so we can avoid putting races near each other next to each other to improve fan experience. But then, when you do that, you\'re admitting that you don\'t mind making it better for Europe, but not for the rest of the world.\n\nIf someone in Australia is going to go to two races, the second is probably Singapore, third is Japan. If you have them back to back weeks, people are much less likely to go to more than one.\n\nIf someone in North America goes to multiple races, it\'s probably two in North America for most of them. If all of them are back to back to back, that makes it much less likely. They are trying Miami and Canada together next year, so we\'ll see how that goes. Except, as always when there\'s a week or more between races, all the drivers and most of the staff will go back to Europe between races.

Here are all of the subplots that the film is trying to juggle:\n\n* Sonny's habit of racing despite his injuries.\n* Sonny's hostile relationship with the press.\n* Pearce trying to make a name for himself as quickly as possible.\n* Ruben's efforts to manage the relationship between the drivers.\n* Banning's attempt to hijack the team.\n* Kate's struggle to make it in Formula 1.\n* Jodie's lack of confidence potentially letting the team down.\n\nThere are just so many subplots that the film's only solution is to work through them as quickly as possible. Take the team itself -- APX is clearly able to attract world-class talent, since Kasper was a team principal at Ferrari and Kate worked at Lockheed-Martin. The film seems to be aiming for the idea that APX has everything it needs for a breakthrough, but they just cannot get the stars to align. However, it then gets distracted by off-track -- and worse, off-camera -- politics that threaten to undermine the team. Its solution to this problem is to have Sonny say a few words of encouragement to Jodie and then have the team go for a run together and suddenly they all work well. Check that box and then move on to the next subplot that needs to be resolved. Sometimes these things fit together pretty well; Sonny's relationship with and management of the team is in contrast to Pearce's, which fuels the tension between them. But because another subplot comes up, the film has no time to breathe.\n\nA character like Kate had the potential to be interesting. She gave up a career working for Lockheed-Martin to join Formula 1, chasing those few tenths of a second that could make the team great. It costs her everything, but she persists because she loves it, even though she cannot explain why. She is probably the person who can come closest to understanding Sonny's feeling of flying, and she is the person who can take that ephemeral feeling and turn it into a physical thing. There is a natural relationship there, but it should not be a romantic one. The film really wobbles in the pub scene because it presents Sonny's charm as flirting. It should have reframed it as him trying to persuade her into supporting him because he thinks Kate has to work *for* him when in reality he needs to work *with* her.\n\nWe know the film went through some reshoots because they were filming at Silverstone in 2023 and 2024. I suspect that the Banning scenes were a late addition -- the framing of the shots on the grid where the cars are behind the camera make me think that this was filmed separately and then spliced in. A lot of the complaints about the film stem from people not really understanding the Banning subplot, probably because it comes up so late. He goes from a goofy supporter of Ruben to a cutthroat board member in the blink of an eye, and the transformation happens off-camera, so I suspect the character was added in or rewritten at the last minute because the film felt the need for a third-act villain. The unintended consequence was that it compressed everything else that the film did, and characters like Kate and Jodie copped the worst of it."", 'I mean overall I like the movie but ngl the way the Kate the TD was portrayed in that movie was atrocious. The Vegas romance between her and Sonny was so unnecessary and she somehow failed to make the car into anything other than a shitbox for more than 2 years until Sonny basically gave her a breakthrough idea in like his first month there.', 'It didn‚Äôt really pass the bechdel test in spirit even though it might have literally. Honestly this movie did feel like a load of compromises made because of a meddling studio - ‚Äúthere has to be a love interest for Sonny‚Äù included', 'Yeah having Jodie being schooled by Sonny immediately on how to do her job and the pit girl being useless had me rolling my eyes.', 'I liked how the women of Sky F1 realised the movie was a little bit shit about women in the sport, so Bernie went round interviewing different female employees at Aston Martin and Red Bull during the Austrian GP weekend. I thought that was a nice bit.', 'The woman who plays Kate in Bridgerton had role with lines and did a lot of PR. They cut her role at the end to a few seconds and no lines', 'It could have meant so much for women in motorsport‚Ä¶ yet they created something thats just a setback for women, objectiving them and dumbing them down to be saved by men. \n\nIts just poor writing and gives the impression that no woman was in the room during the writing process\n\nWhat coulve been‚Ä¶ they could‚Äôve done justice to the intelligence, professionalism and capability of the real women working in motorsport.', 'Could‚Äôve been written by AI.
