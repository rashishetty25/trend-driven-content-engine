1k61fmk,[AMuS] Mercedes made a mistake with the setup,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k61fmk/amus_mercedes_made_a_mistake_with_the_setup/,2025-04-23, News,,"['Translation:\n\n> **The Saudi Arabian GP was, from Mercedes\' perspective, the worst race of the year. After the race, the engineers explained why fifth and sixth places were the best they could hope for.**\n\n> McLaren is slowly disappearing on the horizon. In the chasing pack, however, Mercedes remains the benchmark. Although the Silver Arrows had their weakest weekend of the year so far in Jeddah, George Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli scored the same number of points as Red Bull and only three points less than Ferrari. Russell summarizes: ""If we still finish fifth on a bad day, I can accept that.""\n\n> On Saturday, everything still looked good. George Russell missed pole position by just 0.113 seconds. Andrea Kimi Antonelli placed the Mercedes in fifth place on one of the most difficult tracks. This seemed to indicate that the Silver Arrows were also on top of the game on the high-speed track.\n\n> But the tide turned in the race. In the very discipline in which Mercedes had been so consistent up to that point, Russell had finished on the podium in three of the four races. This time, he began to lose sight of the champagne positions after just 15 laps, even though he was still running in third place.\n\n> **Early pit stop takes its toll.**\nBut suddenly, the gap between Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri widened, and Charles Leclerc slowly made up ground behind him. The pit lane called Russell into the pits on lap 20 because the medium tires were showing clear signs of wear and there were fears that Ferrari might attempt an undercut with Leclerc.\n\n> Leclerc actually drove an extra nine laps, gaining more and more speed on the worn-out medium tires. It dawned on Mercedes that a podium finish might be difficult this time. Even though Leclerc was still 3.6 seconds behind Russell after his pit stop.\n\n> In the second stint, Russell quickly ran into tire problems as well. They overheated: ""I tried to keep up with Max, but it didn\'t work. After that, I wanted to save the tires, but they were much older than Charles and Lando\'s. When they passed me, my tires completely collapsed. I was losing a second per lap to them.""\n\n> **Weak point front tire.**\nThe engineers could see from the data why their chief pilot had his back against the wall. The front tires on the Mercedes were blistering, a sign of overheating. It was unusual, however, that the Mercedes was the one to take the lead. The engineers explained: ""Jeddah is a track where you can choose whether the front or rear tire is subjected to more stress. We chose the front tire and probably overshot the target. We were also surprised by how fast the race pace was.""\n\n> Russell doesn\'t believe the result would have changed if he had approached the stints more cautiously: ""If I had taken more care of the tires, I probably would have still finished fifth. Ferrari was simply faster. We had a greater temperature increase than the other teams. In Bahrain, the tires also got hot, but very differently than here. We need to understand that better.""\n\n> Andrea Kimi Antonelli only felt rapid degradation of the front tires in the first stint. In the second stint, he was spared his teammate\'s extreme tire problem, although he had to deal with Isack Hadjar for six laps immediately after the pit stop. After that, the Mercedes rookie was able to give his tires a rest. The next car in front of him was twelve seconds behind. In the end, Antonelli had enough reserves to keep the closing Hamilton at bay.\n\n> **No chance of a podium finish.**\nMercedes sent both drivers into the race with a medium-hard tire sequence. Lando Norris\'s hard-medium tactic wasn\'t a viable alternative for the strategists. ""If we give Kimi the hard tires at the start, there\'s a risk of Hamilton undercutting. He would then have had to overtake Lewis at the back of the track. We didn\'t want to risk that.""\n\n> Team principal Toto Wolff summed up with a slight frustration: ""We entered the race hoping to fight for a podium finish, but with the limitations of the tires, fifth and sixth places were the maximum for us."" Chief engineer Andrew Shovlin demanded: ""We need to improve our tire management.""', 'knew something had to be wrong when russell was not third.', 'Well, they still have a problem with hot tracks but it isn‚Äôt like last year fortunately. Also, if Jeddah problem was because the setup it isn‚Äôt a huge or a big one imho', "">If I had taken more care of the tyres, I probably would have still finished fifth. Ferrari was simply faster\n\nIt tracks. The drop-off in their pace was significant, and Ferrari genuinely look like they had a leg up in the game. I don't deny that the SF-25's weaknesses are prominent, but in this race alone, they had the upper hand\n\nA little bit of a hot take on my end, but aside from McLaren, I still cannot put a definitive finger on the 2nd or the 3rd fastest car among the grid, between Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes. To say that Ferrari is the slowest amongst the pack will be understandable, but difficult to affirm in sheer confidence. They clearly have strong aspects to capitalize on advantages that perhaps certain teams couldn't, similarly to Red Bull.\n\nAll it takes is for a DNF or two on McLaren's end, or any of their drivers dropping into the no-points zone for Mercedes to pounce on them. It is genuinely nowhere near over just yet. It sounds like copium on my end but if teams and drivers are still in the midst of pulling off great highs, then it is all game so far"", 'Yeah it was clear they had messed something up there. I‚Äôd also argue though that Leclerc was simply faster. Ferrari found something in race pace, whether it was aided by track temps or characteristics or they managed to unlock something on the car, that put them a step ahead in the race. With all the dirty air etc taken into account, Norris was the fastest driver during the race and Leclerc was only fractionally behind him on pace. Ferrari definitely had a step forward last weekend.', 'So is it a damping problem or general spring softness? Or is it an aero thing? They obviously never say, but I never know how to be fast and save tires in Forza while setting up my own car.', 'I‚Äôm no rocket biologist or anything but it feels like it was pretty clear', ""People are so quick nowadays to overreact. In the first four races (including Bahrain) the tire management was perfectly fine and much better than last season, but now after one bad race they all know that Mercedes will be struggeling on every circuit going forward. \n\nThe other way around with Ferrari. After the first four races people were dismissing them entirely, but after one good race, they are suddenly seen as force to reckon with. If anything, we have seen the Top 4 will mix through depending on the track likely till the end of season.

1k5rbdk,Did Max updated Senna's approach in racing to modern times?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1k5rbdk/did_max_updated_sennas_approach_in_racing_to/,2025-04-23, Discussion,"Transcript from Top Gear's Senna tribute, where Martin Brundle and Jeremy Clarkson talked about it:

Another weapon in Senna's armory was his utter ruthlessness.

""Senna's having a load, and Senna's hiding into the pit wall. Schumacher trying to take it and Senna. Now let's see if the Brazilian moved across. Indeed, he did."" (Murray Walker commentating on a battle between Ayrton and Michael)

""He often used to put us in a position where you were gonna have an accident, and he would leave it up to you to decide whether to have that accident or not."" (MB)

Martin experienced this psychological warfare, first of all, when racing against Senna in F3.  
""Well, look, I've got a great big lead here, and he launches in from nowhere and then parks his role on my shoulder. I couldn't get out of the car until they lifted his car off the top of mine."" (MB)

""So when he wants to overtake, he'd he'd go on the inside and put the car in a place. If you try to take the corner, you're going to hit him."" (JC)

""Yes. He would put you in a compromising position and then leave you to make the decision. And if you didn't run into him, then psychologically you were buried and finished.  
He would then know that every time after that he showed you a wheel, you jumped out of the way."" (MB)

Is it just me, or did Max update this approach to modern times?","[""Yes, and I think Schumacher also had a similar approach as well. \n\nI rewatched that segment recently (I'd highly recommend it, one of the best things Top Gear made imo) and was definitely reminded of Max in that moment"", ""Absolutely! Max knows exactly what he is doing and where the limits of the rules are. So he keeps going there because he can. And by driving as aggressive as he does, others know what to expect and can ask themselves if it's worth the risk."", 'This is peak Formula 1 racing for me.\n\nIt needs to retain that jousting match factor in on track battles, where a driver can scare a competitor into submission.', ""I always enjoy watching this episode and I actually asked myself the same question. I think yes, this way is very similar to what Senna did.\n\nThe only difference is: with Senna people say it's magical or special and with Verstappen they say it's reckless and aggressive"", 'People talk too much about how Max knows the limit of the rules lol. He doesn‚Äôt. He just makes sure the decision is in the hands of the stewards and to not lose position on track. He gets a lot of penalties for someone who knows the limit of the rules', 'Yes 100% agree and this is why McLaren are employing the two-driver WDC challenge under ‚Äúpapaya rules‚Äù. Its the only way to beat the ‚Äòyou move or we crash‚Äù approach. Max can‚Äôt crash and take out one McLaren because if he does, the other McLaren likely pulls out a 25pt championship lead on the pair of them. McLaren must keep their two drivers neck and neck all the way to the end of the season.

Pretty sure there are some people here a lot smarter than me that have looked into this already. Would be interesting to see if Max would have done a stint similar to Leclercs if he could have won. He seemed to have good pace on the mediums in the clean air.

","[""I don't think we really know how much extra pace Piastri had in hand.

From that point on until Max pitted, delta was dropping 0.2 per sector.', 'Realistically, the way everything worked out, it went the best it could have.i was hoping for max to at least finish 2nd.

Still in the hunt.', "">I was wondering if Max could have pitted later than he did and come out in front of Piastri.\n\nImpossible. He gave everything he had (remember the, at least, two radio messages of his racing engineer to give it his all) in the mere two laps after Piastri pitted, and he STILL came around 2.5s behind PIA back on track. Piastri was already faster, so had max continued, he would've fallen even more behind.
