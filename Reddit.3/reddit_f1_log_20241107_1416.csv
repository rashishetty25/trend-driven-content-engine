Half the reason wets are so useless is because it’s better to tough it out on shitty intermediates until one of the lesser drivers on shitty intermediates puts it in the wall and red flags the race.', ""That's luck innit. \n\nGutting for him to have done the right thing but still lose out, but that's life."", 'Yuki’s gamble was just stupid. We have seen it time and time again, if the full wets are required, the race gets red flagged. Yuki chose to override the team decision and it was the wrong one.', ""My God these posts are tiring. Every time we get a red before entire field had pitted. If they can't change tires then we'd get 10, how red flag foiled Alpine's p1 gamble, or Max's stellar drive."", ""I find this just such a silly argument. What's next? Are we going to ban pit stops under the safety car because it's unfair to those who pitted just before? Same for VSC?  \nOften, pitting under VSC is favorable. Pitting under SC is generally even more favorable. Allowing to change your tyres under a red flag is not a whole lot different, just with a bit of a bigger impact as you now lose no time rather than just a little time.  \nI might be a minority with this opinion and will probably catch some flack for it, but I feel like the rule is fine. Sometimes you get it right, sometimes you don't. Same with a safety car.  \nAs with everything in F1, teams and drivers only complain about these kinds of things in moments it's not working for them. If it's them profiting from it, you don't hear a peep about it."", 'Im still honestly thinking rather than red flag, the rain safety car was the main cause for TSU, and then the red flag is the cherry on top\n\nThe safety car basically make TSU LAW PER cannot overtake, in perfect tyres condition... It also make Colapinto tries to chase the pack... The red flag totally finished the wet tyre runners, making them in the same basket as the inter that pitted\n\nHad there were no safety car (Just a red flag), TSU probably is close to Russel / Norris, or even could had overtaken them', ""Is the ability to change tires under a red flag unfair? Yes. Do I give one shit about that? Absolutely not. \n\nRed flags are not about putting on a show. Red flags are about safety. The structural and tractive status of tires are one of the most important aspects of safe vehicle operation. In engineering terms, we'd say that they're both high scope and safety-critical: meaning they're simultaneously used all the time for everything, and they have to work or you might die. I don't believe any other system on a modern F1 car is as high up the chain on both of those categories simultaneously. Tires can be changed under red flags because red flags are associated with dangerous track condition that can threaten the structural and tractive status of tires. Because this is a critical safety consideration, and any driver or any fan complaining about it can go pound sand. I don't care if it fucked over someone's race, I don't think we should risk killing someone so that your favorite driver can get the finishing placement you think they deserve."", ""The real fix I'd like to see is set up a system where they leave the pits, have to back off the car in front using VSC to the same gaps they had before the safety car/red flag.  That way whatever leads/gaps you had you keep after.  The tech to do it is there.  With that kind of system, you can consider taking away red flag tire changes, because teams will have the gaps back that so the strategy impact is a lot less."", ""I think his problem with the SC is that if they just let them race they'll figure out they need the full wets when people behind start to close in.

If you look at 4:19 you can see the whole car from overhead and it\'s the only year where the nose would look like that.\n\nFor some reason BMW published a guide to the steering wheel at the time seen here: [https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/photo/detail/P0016281/williamsf1-bmw-fw26-steering-wheel-07/2004?language=en](https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/photo/detail/P0016281/williamsf1-bmw-fw26-steering-wheel-07/2004?language=en)  / Direct link to hi-res: [https://i.imgur.com/OtwVknA.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/OtwVknA.jpeg)\n\n  \nAs you can see they did have a switch called ""FSC"" but this is simply labelled as ""high speed engine braking"".

BMW and many manufacturers offer this on their road cars today, with sport modes they adjust the throttle map to make the pedal ""feel"" more sensitive by reducing the actual range.', 'That was correlated to GPS, and only worked @ eau rouge, Spa…', ""So thinking about it, I could absolutely understand a button that changes throttle map to effectively ignore a driver's foot lifting on the pedal and keep full throttle being useful for bumpy tracks. \n\nIIRC this was around the era (2000s) when F1 electronic driver aids all got a bit crazy. There was even automatic downshifting alongside TC and launch control. Overriding the physical throttle position would not have been unusual to hear."", 'You could try on r/F1technical', 'From the era of blown diffusers? \n\nIf I remember rightly people would be on the throttle through the corner as the exhaust was routed through the rear diffuser to generate more airflow and therefore grip. Although BMW may have been gone by then.', 'That engine was so shit that it probably did both at the same time.', 'Yeah but that wouldn’t match his explanation TC denies throttle and not forces it']",21,15,0.68,21,52,52,-6,0,-0.039999999999999925,-6
1gla42c,"[Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team] Why Did We Pit During the VSC? | 2024 São Paulo GP F1 Akkodis Race Debrief  (Summary in comments: VSC, Brake issues, Setup differences, Tyres pressures and penalty, COTA upgrades, W16) ",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gla42c/mercedesamg_petronas_formula_one_team_why_did_we/,2024-11-06, Video,,"['(I might start doing these summaries weekly, let me know if you\'re interested and if anything can be improved)\n\n\n\xa0- Q: Acknowledging hindsight, would the team manage Russell\'s strategy differently?\xa0\xa0\n\n\nA: Once they announced the VSC was ending, they had a very short window (1 or 2 seconds) to tell George to stay out so as not to suffer a full pit stop time loss. Prior to that stopping made sense as Norris also stopped and George would have still come out on fresh tyres ahead of all the cars behind.\xa0 Shovlin says normally they try not to assume that it\'ll get red flagged because if you stay out and don\'t get a red flag, you\'re in trouble. Sometimes you get it right, sometimes you get it wrong and this time the cars that gambled got what they wanted.\xa0\n\n\n- Q: What were the issues with the brakes that both drivers complained about?\xa0\n\n\nA: George said the brake disc felt like they had ""warped"" but they didn\'t. There can be higher friction in some areas that can create vibrations that the drivers can feel through the pedals. They are still investigating but think it could be due to the very cold temperatures, as the brakes were fine in the dry and other drivers also complained about brake vibrations during the race. George thinks it was costing 2 or 3 tenths a lap.\n\n\n- Q: Lewis was particularly struggling with the car. In general how challenging is it to make sure the setup suits both drivers\' demands?\xa0\n\n\nA: Normally you\'re able to do it, they let the drivers deviate with the setup, evolve their own setup and when one of them appears to be going well you often take some elements or even the whole lot and put it on the other car.\xa0\n\n\n\xa0Lewis was mainly struggling with rear grip, in the sprint for example he had snaps of oversteer, which overheats the tyres and prolongs the issue. The difference between the sprint (hot and dry) and the race (cold and wet) made it difficult to get the car where he wanted.\xa0\n\n\n- Q: What about adjusting the tyres pressure on the grid and the subsequent penalty?\n\n\nA: When they got the message for the restart, there was only 10 minutes to go, and the tyres must be on the car with 5 to go (serious penalty if you break that rule says Shovlin). The pitlane layout in Brazil is unsual and makes more difficult for teams to get the car. The tyres they selected hadn\'t been ""bled down"" to race pressures and the penalty was because there wasn\'t time for the FIA checks.\n\n\n$5,000 fine per car, no rules around tyre pressures were broken and no sporting advantage was gained, mitigating factor of not having enough time to bring the tyres and get the checks done.\n\n\n- Q: Did the COTA upgrades perform as expected?\n\n\nA: In terms of loads measured, they\'re seeing what they expect and where they expect in terms of ride height range. In the wet the car worked well in quali (front row) and in the race, particularly the first stint with George. However in the dry they have issues in slow speed, particularly when one corner follows another and a lot of turning is required.\xa0\n\n\nThe aim of those upgrades wasn\'t to fix that but to lift the base performance of the car, which is what they\'re doing. They know they still have some fundamentals to tackle in order to fix them on the W16, which they\'re very busy with at the moment.\xa0\n\n\n- Q: What learnings for the W16 and how will the team prepare for the rest to the season?\xa0\n\n\nA: The main weakness has been the same, the interconnected slow corners like sector 2 in Brazil. They\'ll keep working on that in the next races. The final three races will be useful to assess performance, determine who is the benchmark between Red Bull, Ferrari and McLaren and establish the gap that needs to be closed down over the winter.\xa0', "">W16\n\nFeels like yesterday the W13 was porpoising down the Bahrain straight, and now we're close to meeting the W16. Time flies..."", 'So Shov seemed to just blame Hamilton\'s performance on a bad setup when Hamilton stated it was the worst car he\'s ever driven in these regs. \n\nAt this point it feels like they must just be told what to say by PR before doing these things, they say a lot of words, yet nothing ever makes a lot of sense. \n\nIt\'s unfortunate, as these used to be very informative videos that were exciting to watch to get a glimpse of what actually goes on behind the scenes. \n\nGuess it got old saying, ""We still don\'t understand how our car works, our upgrade\'s wind tunnel/sim correlations don\'t ever match our on track performance.""', 'I really call BS with merc getting away with a slap on the wrist for the tire pressure thing. Sure it’s not really that big a deal but it’s the rules and all the other teams managed it', 'If they tried to up the performance base without solving the issue the previous upgrade bring, I am not sure this is the correct path for development this generation of cars…', ""Why is everyone saying George has the old spec even if according to the team he doesn't? Genuine question"", 'Thank you for the write-up', ""I don't think he blamed Lewis more like gave excuses instead of getting at why exactly was there such a difference in performance and added the weather made it unpredictable.\n\nYea after they got a sponsor these debriefs have become a bit sanitized ngl, they used to be quite upfront a couple of years ago."", ""Hamilton has been a bit shit in ground effect cars. That's the reality of it. They're physically extremely demanding to drive and he's nearly 40 now. Alonso has similar issues.\n\nYears 1 and 2 they were working the car around his wants. So minimising bouncing and getting the ride height as high as pos. Year 3 he is leaving, so they're focusing on what George wants. Results are obvious."", ""I think the FIA knows they're partly responsible, and they also let Norris off easy about the formation lap infringement, which is a much bigger offense.

That led to a 7:30am qualifying session that saw Lando Norris take pole before Max Verstappen’s stunning victory, and Vasseur says the queues of fans waiting to get in reminded him it was the right call for those attending.\n\n\n“We can’t complain,” Vasseur said. “At the end of the day, we were able to do the race. I think the race was a good one. What we have to keep in mind is that when I came at 5am there were already thousands of fans outside and at least for them it’s important to do the job.\n\n\n“For sure, the conditions were not ideal for the team, for everybody, but at the end of the day it was the only option to do the race and I think it was a good one.”\n\n\nCharles Leclerc’s fifth place helped limit the damage in the constructors’ championship between Ferrari and McLaren, but the Monegasque blamed himself for setup choices hurting his pace, something Vasseur disagrees with.\n\n\n“He’s always the first one to blame himself but I’m not sure he’s in charge of the setup. It was a difficult Sunday, but I think overall it’s not a dramatic weekend. And it’s more on some choices that it was quite difficult to anticipate, things like the pit stop. You can say at the end of the day if you stay on track and you are waiting for the red flag it’s the right call, but if you crash you look stupid.\n\n\n“Honestly, these kinds of weekends are quite difficult to manage from the pit wall and the car; but it’s more the pace and the setup because the pace was really difficult. We were seven tenths slower than Norris at the beginning of the stint and probably six or seven tenths faster than him at the end.”', 'Imagine having saturday tickets, not seeing the qualification and then reading this...', 'Brazil Chads are different', 'I don’t think there was a better option.

In reality it’s not exactly like that. One doubt, for example, concerns Jack Doohan, 21, son of the five-time motorcycle rider, who should debut next year with the Alpine alongside the confirmed Pierre Gasly. The conditional is a must, because it seems that Flavio Briatore has changed his mind and has managed to blow the Argentine Franco Colapinto, 21, to the competition, a revelation of this glimpse of the season since he took the place of Logan Sargeant at Williams. If the operation materializes, it would mean the end of Doohan jr’s dreams, who has long held the role of reserve for the French team.*\n\nOf note, Doohan did testing alongside Gasly yesterday in Qatar…', ""Colapinto is really really quickly reaching the massively overhyped stage.\n\nGuy had an ok-ish Junior career and a few good F1 races and he's been linked with half the grid including Red Bull.\n\nI'd be seriously pissed if Doohan loses his F1 chance over this."", ""lol no one would want to join Alpine's program if they shaft him like this\n\ndropping your academy driver who has not even done a race for another teams academy driver who has potential no doubt but has driven less than half of the season\n\ngood shit alpine"", 'It´s weird that they are giving more entity to this rumour than the one of RedBull/RacingBulls which is not even mentioned.', '>Of note, Doohan did testing alongside Gasly yesterday in Qatar…\n\nMartins was also there aswell. \n\nCould they have organized a shootout where they compared Doohan and Martins against a reference set by Gasly? \n\nIf none of them are deemed good enough after this test, this could motivate them to try to push through with Colapinto', '“5 time motorcycle rider”. That’s so disrespectful to one of the GOATS of motorsport racing', ""I think in some ways de Vries and Sargeant's struggles helped set an expectation that 'normal' rookies entering and struggling is to be expected, so Colapinto's good performances have been out of the ordinary to some extent. The fact Albon has been so highly rated yet Colapinto has seemingly been equal to, if not better then, him does suggest Colapinto has landed pretty well.
