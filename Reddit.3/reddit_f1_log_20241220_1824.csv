Maybe one of your guys had the random idea of a double diffuser while showering and you look like a genius for a season. But what he says about Sauber completely losing sight of the present definitely tracks. They made big leaps in the final fifth of the year:\n\n>""When I joined in August, really, it was like a team that was almost frozen,"" added Binotto. ""So while making sure that we had the proper plans in our journey to become a top team in the future, we really needed to boost the team for improvement and possibly already during the current season.\n\n>""How important the current season was was not only about not finishing with zero points, because finishing 10th with zero or 10th with four points does not change much.\n\n>""But it was more for us to make sure that we have defined the proper direction of development for next season as well – and being energised through the wintertime.\n\nI agree that you have to keep the tension to improve every season because otherwise when ""your year"" comes you won\'t have the right processes to compete. Strategizing long-term is of course the main job of Audi in their position, but you can\'t ignore continuous development and the meaning of fighting (even if it\'s for random points) because you will grow a culture of passivity.', ""To everybody who usually only reads the headline read the interview, its a really good and insightful one.\n\nToto Wolff once said that success in F1 is all about the long term.

Makes his podium all the less likely. Although Binotto is making sure there are already improvements this season and the next. I mean that Sauber in the last 3-4 races was reasonably fast and got them their first few points.

Don't get me wrong, Nico is a great driver but signing a driver into his 40 is always a huge risk unless your name is Alonso or Hamilton.
