i would like to buy my boyfriend tickets for the upcoming f1 season as a valentines day gift.

which race would you guys suggest will be the most entertaining to watch? he likes ferarri but doesn't exclusively root for one team or player. 

I personally want watch the monza race but i read online that it is a harder circuit for overtakes. and as far as I noticed from the few races i have watched - the overtakes are the most fun part üòÖ

","[""Since you mentioned Monza I assume it will be Europe only, so I'd say if you want the highest chance of having a good race go to Silverstone or the Red Bull Ring.\n\nFun also means something else for everybody.

At the track, depending on the track, it might be difficult to sit in a place that is likely to have overtakes, and it can still be very entertaining to watch the cars go past.

1i6ns3t,What's the minimum healthy number of teams for a sustainable F1 grid,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i6ns3t/whats_the_minimum_healthy_number_of_teams_for_a/,2025-01-21, Discussion,"I've heard 12, I've heard 14, I've also heard that the league struggles to maintain 10 teams.  

I'm sure there are situations that can change the number so I'm basically asking, right now, how many teams you feel F1 should grow/shrink to for maximum health of the sport.

In my opinion F1 should look to target 12 active teams if possible.  I think that's a good number to allow 3-4 to struggle at any given time without majorly impacting the competitiveness of the entire grid and ensuring a competitive midpack, which as we saw in 2023 and  2024 can be vital for the longterm viability of the sport with McLaren and Aston Martin emerging from the midpack to challenge for top positions (and then Aston Martin falling back, but it was still fun while it lasted).

Bottom line in my mind 12 teams is the right number to maintain a healthy midpack from which new challengers for the stop spots might emerge.  This is entirely my own opinion but I'm curious what others think.","[""I think the maximum sustainable number is 13 since it's required for a circuit to be able to accommodate that, but a few probably wouldn't be able to support any more. So circuits would have to change and that would be strenuous for contracts.\n\nI think 12 is a good aim, we've had 12 recently without any issues.\n\nMinimum is probably pretty low, like 7 or 8, but that's an absolute minimum and not ideal"", 'Definitely more than 3, that gives 2005 US GP vibes.\n\nAPXGP made it 11 teams, are you saying they don‚Äôt count?', ""10 Seemed to work well, and I would think that's the minimum. I would love to see 12, but man, qually is gonna be a nightmare on some circuits."", 'I think 11 is good enough. Sure, there used to be more in the past, but cars were smaller.\nI think the safety concern is the main aspect. 12 teams is a stretch, 14 is ridiculous.\nThe number of teams should not be determined by the number of teams who should be allowed to struggle.\nRacing is good with 20 cars. Let‚Äôs see how 22 work out. Any bigger number will require so many overhauls to sessions, tracks, finances and points.', '24 should be completely fine in all aspects', 'The bigger you get, the more likelihood that the worst team will be SO bad that they are a danger to themselves and everyone else by being so far off the pace that they affect the top teams more than the midfield does. I imagine it was pretty terrible watching the same two cars qualify P21 and P22 and do 3 seconds a lap slower than the pace for seasons on end.', ""There was 12 back during 2010-2013, and honestly it worked fine, but the three teams at the bottom Lotus, Virgin, and HRT really brought nothing to F1 so the impact of 24 cars really wasn't felt back then, however with Andretti coming in I hope eventually we get one more COMPETITIVE team on the grid."", 'Taking a look back, it is astounding that in 1989 here were 21 constructors entered in F1. One dropped out quickly. Still, 20 constructors.', "" It's doing fine now, probably sometime in the time where it's had 10 teams 20 drivers has had it's most popular period ever, so I don't see how you can think that 10 is below the minimum needed. \n\nI do think below 10 teams of two cars each might be bad for the sport. Not that it would die, but I think it would be bad. It's why I can't actually resent Lawrence Stroll, because without him we really might have gone down to nine teams, and the other teams still would have fought against an addition. \n\nI think ten teams is good. I think eleven teams will be good. I think 12 teams would be fine. I think more than 24 of these cars in some tracks is pretty dicey. Of course, there are the tracks that are already too small, but that is usually a width problem.""]",0,25,0.26,0,22,22,0,1,-0.04999999999999999,0
