For me, I think it will end up being Perez and Jak Crawford. I think they'll want a young driver and a vet. Bottas is probably the best vet available, but it will probably be Perez because he's from Mexico and can bring big sponsor money and a lot of Mexican fans.
And Jak because I think they'll want a young American driver and I don't think that Herta is as strong a connection as it was before.

I think it should be Bottas and Yuki. Yuki doesn't have a contract for next year and even though he's not so young anymore, he still has potential and hasn't gotten the shot he deserves. And Bottas is the best vet available.

And I personally would love for it to be Bottas and Mick Schumacher. This is meant to just be who you would love to see, I know this won't happen, I know that it shouldn't happen, but man I really want to see Mick drive anything other than a Haas. Him and Valterri are my favourite recent drivers.

I think Williams takes a step forward on driver talent alone. Last year was a disappointment for them, but I really feel Sargeant dragged the whole team down.

But alongside the seven-time world champion, the Scuderia also secured the services of Lo√Øc Serra as technical director chassis and, more quietly, J√©r√¥me d‚ÄôAmbrosio.

While his arrival didn‚Äôt create the same media frenzy, d‚ÄôAmbrosio is already making a significant impact behind the scenes.

# The Perfect Fit for Ferrari

Described by team principal Fred Vasseur as having¬†**‚Äúthe perfect profile‚Äù**, d‚ÄôAmbrosio took on the role of deputy team principal and head of the Ferrari Driver Academy in October 2023.

His experience in both racing and team management makes him an ideal lieutenant for Vasseur as Ferrari undergoes a transformation ahead of Hamilton‚Äôs arrival in 2025.

With seasons increasing in length, the scope for learning from a replacement has also increased. Moreover, the coming season has many rookie drivers. Finally, the season after has a host of rule changes and it will be important to have a pair of drivers that are sufficiently experienced to deal with new conditions.

Another rookie or one of the drivers waiting in the docks (think about Bottas' role at Mercedes).","[""I think it's a given that it will be Doohan lmao.

Whilst pre-season testing isn't a reliable indicator of a team's performance of the coming season, its undeniable that red bull's performance has fallen off since mid 2024. 

My question is how can a team that was so dominant, winning all but 1 race in 2023, be where they are right now, without a change in regulations?

Red bull's internal issues aside (power struggle, hornergate, newey departure) how much of the performance drop can be attributed to reduction of development time & money from finishing 1st for several consecutive seasons + cost cap breach penalty (-10% wind tunnel time) + late grasp of the current regulations by competitors?

In terms of absolute performance, Max was faster at every comparable race (2023 vs 2024) in the latter half of the calendar (Quali times). The smallest gap is 0.285s faster (Italian GP), ballooning to 1.09s faster (Mexico) and 2.7s faster (COTA) neither of which occasions he got pole!\n\nWhat actually happened was that the competition caught and passed Red Bull, which creates the impression of Red Bull falling away.

Hes amazing and gets the maximum points their cars can get, but his tendency to be able to drive around a cars problems can be problematic.
