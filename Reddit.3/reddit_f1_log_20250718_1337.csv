This is a more likely scenario than any of the above driver but still I think Russell would chose Aston Martin if he can.\n\nAlonso - This leads to the last option. If Russell goes to AM and AM decide to out Alonso rather than Stroll (depends how much influence Honda has in driver line up. If they had a lot they would not accept Alonso’s sacking) then Alonso would want a seat. He would have RB and Alpine with seats open.

I am facing a bit of a conundrum about my future. For context: I am a (going into in September) third year Aerospace student at Bristol university and want to work in F1 as an aerodynamicist or something similar - technical side. Currently I am on track for a 1st class degree and am on the bachelors course (3 years).

I have not had any experience in F1 but am shadowing a GT3 team race weekend and have done a 7 week research internship which involved wind tunnels and aeroelastic testing this summer. I am part of my university's equivalent to formula student and will be aerodynamics lead next year.  I am also press manager for my university's FS AI team although I don't really do much technical stuff and regularly volunteer/participate in engineering outreach activities. My third year individual project is going to be F1 related. 

1) Do I ask to change course to 4 years and apply for F1 placements between my 3 and 4 years? I do not really like the idea of staying in the same city for so long and don't want to feel too comfortable if that makes sense. 

2) Do I apply for grad roles off the bat with no F1 experience?

3) Do I apply for MSc Advanced Computational Methods at Imperial to bolster CV? I really like all the modules listed for this course and want to live in London for a year of my life 

I'm currently thinking of applying for grad roles and the MSc and just doing 3 years at Bristol but this summer in the engineering department has really made me love the uni and made my decision harder.

Any input would be appreciated! Be as harsh and realistic as you want!

Thanks","['The book ""How to win a Grand Prix"" by Bernie Collins has an interesting section on the recruitment process for graduates - for that one team at least. \n\nOthers have said this, but get a masters, and follow your dream. However, don\'t be disheartened if you miss out on a graduate role - it is incredibly competitive. There\'s a lot of aerospace in the UK where those qualifications will be valued and there will always be roles that you can apply for in the future. F1 teams don\'t just recruit from other F1 teams. \n\n\nIgnore the naysayers - you\'re doing aerospace engineering at university in the UK whilst getting involved in other Motorsport. You couldn\'t be in a better position to make it happen.', 'I\'ll just answer the part for grad roles: Yes, no F1 experience is required to get into the grad roles, that\'s what they are for! Obviously, having motorsport experience or any experience from your Uni that shows that you are really invested into motorsports (and good enough at that) would still be what interviewers are looking for and improve your chances of getting in.\n\nIf you\'re dead set to get into F1, applying for the placement program is imo the best way to bolster your chances. For one, gives you an idea of if you really want to be doing this (a guy I know swore off the idea of doing it after uni after their placement), and if you prove to be someone they like they\'ll ""reserve"" you for when you graduate.', ""1 - Placements can be incredible, for the life and professional experience they can give you., plus a good way of making sure that F1/Engineering is really what you want to do.  They are hotly contested though so have a plan for other sectors / companies you think you'd also get a lot of learning from.  \nThat said, not everyone working in F1 did a placement year!  \n  \nIt may be a bit late now, but if you're comfortable with cold messaging people on LinkedIn, work your way through the Aero Departments and ask if they would be willing to provide support for your Final Year Project, or if there's a final year project you could do which would feedback into that team. (It does happen!).\n\n2 - Grad Roles are just what they say they are, roles for graduates - you can't ask people for multiple years of F1 XP when they are of standard university leavers age.  There are people who work in F1 who never had any intention of working in it, but they had the right skills to fit the job.  As a grad no one would be expecting you to know **everything** and they won't be measuring you against people who have been there for years.\n\n3 - You could stick to your current BEng course, nail your First, and apply for paid internships at engineering companies.  Do one of those for a year / set number of months, and then move into an MSc of your choosing, potentially with a better idea of what you would like to specialise in. \n\n  \nFormula Student is not a deal-breaker for F1 teams - it's now such a commonly held activity that it doesn't make candidates standout any more - you know yourself, but ensure that if you end up in FS full time that you'll still have the capacity to ace your exams and final year project.
