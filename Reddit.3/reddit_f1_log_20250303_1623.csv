This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika Häkkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

Do you think Russell would be so very different as an opponent to Norris than Max? Of course no points advantage to Russell at this point of the season, but I mean expect more Senna/Schumi and not Räikkönen type of w2w.', ""so, McLaren will most likely be the team to beat by a large margin, but behind them it'll tight, tight, tight, with RB, Ferrari and Mercedes fighting it out for first runner up"", 'Only Schumacher could have fought for the title in the 1996 Benetton. While Alesi was not even close to the level of Schumacher, the same can be said of anyone from that era. Alesi was in the group of the next best drivers in the mid to late 1990s. The fact that Alesi couldn’t even score half of Hill’s points in 1996, shows how incredibly dominant Williams were that year, and no driver other than Schumacher would’ve done significantly better than Alesi.']",6,24,0.68,6,23,23,-2,3,-0.04999999999999993,-2

Mine are as follows:

- 90% McLaren wins the championship
- 50% Hamilton wins the driver's championship
- 10% All drivers for the top 4 teams win a race.","['90% MBS gets something thrown at him from the crowd\n50% the swearing fines get dropped\n10% Yuki has a good enough year to actually deserve a RB seat', '90% - More different GP winners than in 2023\n\n50% - McLaren to win both championships\n\n10% - 3+ rookies will outscore their teammates', '90%  Mclaren WCC\n\n50% Verstappen WDc\n\n10% Jack doohan survives', ""There is no chance in hell Hamilton wins the WDC without Ferrari also winning the WCC.
