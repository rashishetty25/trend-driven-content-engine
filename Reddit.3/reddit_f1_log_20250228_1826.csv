Strong, but it’s early”",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j0akm5/leclerc_we_need_to_work_on_the_balance_mclaren/,2025-02-28, News,,"['Translation \n\n\nCharles Leclerc\'s preseason activity concluded with the morning of the third day of testing . The Monegasque, who spoke to the press in the conference held inside Ferrari hospitality, summed up the sensations he felt at the wheel of the SF-25 during the three days of testing. The unusual conditions of the three days in Sakhir complicated the collection of realistic data, although it is clear to the entire paddock that McLaren appears to be the most competitive team at the moment. From Leclerc\'s point of view, what has been seen is only a preliminary picture, since there are many issues still to be resolved in view of Melbourne.\n\n\nLeclerc: “We struggled a bit with the balance, but we see the numbers we expected”\n\nOne of the aspects that makes it difficult to draw up analyses by the protagonists themselves is linked to the anomalous conditions that occurred in Bahrain , between temperatures and grip levels. “Honestly, I don’t think I’ve ever experienced a Bahrain like this before,” commented Charles Leclerc in the press conference organised by Ferrari. “It was very cold, there was also rain, the temperatures are not what we are used to, so the reference compared to other years is very difficult. Usually we have much warmer conditions.” On the work with the SF-25 he then added: “we see all the numbers we expected . Today we struggled a bit more with the balance , even yesterday afternoon it was a bit more difficult to manage, so there is still a bit of work to do.”\n\nFinding the right balance was, from Leclerc\'s point of view, the theme on which the work in the Maranello garage focused. Only in Australia will it be possible to draw concrete conclusions. ""I would prefer to wait before making any predictions,"" Leclerc underlined. ""For now we are working hard to try to improve this balance , which we have struggled a bit to put in the right place in the last two days. After that we will only see in Melbourne when we will have everything in the best conditions to try to extract the best from the car, but basically we struggled a bit more in the balance, and that is where we are concentrating now.""\n\n\nOn McLaren\'s level: ""We use their performance to understand what we lack""\n\nThe Ferrari driver also maintained a moderate line in terms of comparison with McLaren , which at the moment seems to be the benchmark of the group. “McLaren seems like a very strong car for now,” said Leclerc . “But it’s very early to talk , so we have to focus on ourselves and not get caught up in the top ranks. There are still a lot of question marks, but we’ve learned a lot during these first tests and that will certainly help us hit the right window for the first race.” The very solid race simulations put on the track by the Woking team have certainly captured the attention of protagonists and insiders, but Leclerc didn’t say he was too scared, explaining how they could instead be useful for obtaining a yardstick. “Maybe it’s a first idea of what we can expect, but there are still a lot of unknowns, so we have to take these times with a pinch of salt. However, they have been very important for us to understand what we are missing compared to them .

In that scenario he absolutely walks the 92 season similarly to Mansell. We know based on their respective comparison to Prost that Mansell and Alesi would probably be closely matched, with maybe an edge going to Mansell over a single lap.\n\n93 would be interesting for Alesi at Williams. Prost was weaker after his sabbatical, but maybe not by as much as some might suspect. Hill did a terrific job that year. I wonder how much Jean might have been mentally tested by having a quick rookie challenge (or even beat) him the year after winning a title.\n\nWas Hill at McLaren in 97 ever realistically going to happen? I always understood 98 was a better possibility. It really depends a lot on who he would’ve replaced. I think a competitive car would’ve brought the best out of Damon at that time. I thought his bad days in 96 when he made bad starts and sat behind slower cars were really just a result of tentativeness, an eagerness to avoid the mistakes of 95. With a WDC under his belt and the monkey off his back, I think we might have seen a much more authoritative but assured version of Damon. If so, he’d have had a good chance of winning the 98 title. I’d bet on him against Coulthard, with Mika we might have seen a 1986-style scenario where they take enough points from each other to let Schumacher in, but that’s if Damon is at his best.', ""Warwick's 85 season at Renault was not too hot. Would he have performed better in a quicker car? Possibly. But I still think he would've been chewed up and spat out by Rosberg in 85 just as Mansell was, maybe worse than Mansell was. \n\nI think Alesi would've done slightly better than Mansell in both 91 and 92, but not that much better. Both drivers were very similar calibre. Against Prost in 93 it would've been closer than in 91, but he would still lose the title assuming he inherits Hill's 4 mechanical failures in this hypothetical.\n\nIf Hill went to McLaren and replaced Coulthard in 1997 it would've been interesting. Though I don't think he was offered a contract until 1998, but for the sake of the hypothetical assuming he joins in 97, I think Hill would've beat Hakkinen in 97 and Hakkinen would've beat him in 98. It's possible that Schumacher would've taken the 98 title in that case, but tough to predict because Hill would've taken points off both of them."", 'Only for the race - 110kg maximum.  \n  \nOtherwise there is no specified limit.']",6,12,0.75,6,12,12,-2,0,-0.07999999999999996,-2
