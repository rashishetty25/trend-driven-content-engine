In that scenario he absolutely walks the 92 season similarly to Mansell. We know based on their respective comparison to Prost that Mansell and Alesi would probably be closely matched, with maybe an edge going to Mansell over a single lap.\n\n93 would be interesting for Alesi at Williams. Prost was weaker after his sabbatical, but maybe not by as much as some might suspect. Hill did a terrific job that year. I wonder how much Jean might have been mentally tested by having a quick rookie challenge (or even beat) him the year after winning a title.\n\nWas Hill at McLaren in 97 ever realistically going to happen? I always understood 98 was a better possibility. It really depends a lot on who he would‚Äôve replaced. I think a competitive car would‚Äôve brought the best out of Damon at that time. I thought his bad days in 96 when he made bad starts and sat behind slower cars were really just a result of tentativeness, an eagerness to avoid the mistakes of 95. With a WDC under his belt and the monkey off his back, I think we might have seen a much more authoritative but assured version of Damon. If so, he‚Äôd have had a good chance of winning the 98 title. I‚Äôd bet on him against Coulthard, with Mika we might have seen a 1986-style scenario where they take enough points from each other to let Schumacher in, but that‚Äôs if Damon is at his best.', ""Warwick's 85 season at Renault was not too hot. Would he have performed better in a quicker car? Possibly. But I still think he would've been chewed up and spat out by Rosberg in 85 just as Mansell was, maybe worse than Mansell was. \n\nI think Alesi would've done slightly better than Mansell in both 91 and 92, but not that much better. Both drivers were very similar calibre. Against Prost in 93 it would've been closer than in 91, but he would still lose the title assuming he inherits Hill's 4 mechanical failures in this hypothetical.\n\nIf Hill went to McLaren and replaced Coulthard in 1997 it would've been interesting. Though I don't think he was offered a contract until 1998, but for the sake of the hypothetical assuming he joins in 97, I think Hill would've beat Hakkinen in 97 and Hakkinen would've beat him in 98. It's possible that Schumacher would've taken the 98 title in that case, but tough to predict because Hill would've taken points off both of them."", 'Only for the race - 110kg maximum.  \n  \nOtherwise there is no specified limit.']",6,12,0.75,6,12,12,-2,0,-0.07999999999999996,-2
