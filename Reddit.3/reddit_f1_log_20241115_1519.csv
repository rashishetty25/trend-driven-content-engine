1gru00i,[Tobi Gr√ºner] Formula 1 is working on a rule change for 2026 to make life harder for customer teams like RB or Haas. If a team finishes P5 or higher in the WCC it has to design all non-listed parts (TRC) on their own (after a period of 3 years),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gru00i/tobi_gr√ºner_formula_1_is_working_on_a_rule_change/,2024-11-15, News,,"['From the linked article: ""While Toro Rosso (Racing Bulls) is open to the proposal, Haas team boss Ayao Komatsu has already announced his opposition. ""It would be a killer for the small teams. If Formula 1 wants as many teams as possible to be competitive, then it will reject this rule. What better thing could happen to the sport than David winning against Goliath?""\n\nKomatsu also believes that the in-house production of certain parts is overrated: ""What fan cares whether the gearbox or the suspension comes from Ferrari or from us?""', 'What? Why? What good or bad does it do?', 'So if you finish 5th once, you then need to build your own parts within 3 years? For how long?\n\nIf Haas finishes 5th in 2026, then finishes 10th the next ten years, will they get a reprieve? Or do they have to continue to make their own parts for all eternity?\n\nIf Andretti bought Haas after Haas finished 5th, would the rule reset?\n\nThis seems really confusing to implement. Either ban the practice outright, or leave it as is. This rule makes no sense.', 'p5 or higher is an odd cutoff. why even have it in the first place, have the same rule for all teams, either let everyone use non listed parts or no one', 'So, we will see the customer teams intentionally throwing races, retiring early or skipping them entirely in order to not finish too high.\n\nSounds great and will certainly motivate the drivers too.', 'Seems a dumb rule if it only applies after you finish 5th, would be a huge oenalty for success.\n\nEither they require all teams to make everything or not, if they do, put it in the rules for 3 years time.\n\nEither teams invest and skill up to the required level, or they sell up to one of the many interested parties that could.', 'out of all the things to try and fix, this was not on my bingo card', ""A customer team that's doing great work? let's make them less competitive!"", '> ***Homemade penalty for too much success?***\n\n> ***Haas\' success is a thorn in the side of its competitors. Opponents want a racing team to have to produce more parts in-house. If a team is too successful, they will be forced to do so in the future.***\n\n> *The dispute is as old as the Haas model in Formula 1. In 2016, the US racing team used a loophole in the rules to enter the premier class. All parts that the regulations did not require the team to build themselves were ordered from engine partner Ferrari. This saved costs and reduced the risk. The team boss at the time, Guenther Steiner, had thus made the premier class attractive to CNC machine king Gene Haas.*\n\n> *The concept was controversial from the start. Force India, Williams, McLaren and Sauber felt betrayed. They took the view that you had to work hard to get your place in the formula. In their opinion, that was not the case with Haas. 60 percent of the car came from Ferrari. Steiner countered the critics at the time by saying that the Haas team would not have existed without this special path.*\n\n> ***Toro Rosso is also planning the Haas model***\n\n> *After Haas fell ever further down the table in 2019, the criticism died down. That changed abruptly this year. The US racing team currently has the fifth fastest car in the field and is battling with Alpine and Toro Rosso for sixth place in the constructors\' championship. To make matters worse, the last-placed team from the previous season has now also joined forces with Toyota.*\n\n> *At the same time, Toro Rosso is also moving closer to the Haas solution. The synergies with its sister team Red Bull are increasing year by year. From 2026, external production will be fully exploited. The engine, transmission, suspension, hydraulics and steering will then come from a single source. From next year, the engineers will also work in their own building on the Red Bull campus in Milton Keynes. This fuels mistrust.*\n\n> *For the teams that produce everything themselves, these joint ventures are suddenly a thorn in their side. Aston Martin, Alpine and Williams in particular are taking a stand against this rule and demanding a higher percentage of in-house production. The problem is that Haas would not be able to design and manufacture everything itself overnight. To do that, they would need a new factory, more people and more tools.*\n\n> ***Three years of preparation for DIY***\n\n> *In the dispute over customer teams, a compromise has recently emerged that will be included in the regulations for 2026 if it finds the necessary majority. According to this, a so-called customer team that finishes fifth or better in the constructors\' championship once must then build everything itself with a lead time of three years. Success is thus punished.*\n\n> *While Toro Rosso is open to the proposal, Haas team boss Ayao Komatsu has already announced his opposition. ""It would be a killer for the small teams. If Formula 1 wants as many teams as possible to be competitive, then it will reject this rule. What better thing could happen to the sport than David winning against Goliath?""*\n\n> *Komatsu also believes that the in-house production of certain parts is overrated: ""What fan cares whether the gearbox or the suspension comes from Ferrari or from us?"" The accusation that Haas has a competitive advantage by purchasing certain parts is dismissed by Komatsu: ""We are credited with a nominal equivalent value in the budget cap for the components we buy. It is so high that we have no advantage."" In fact, Sauber returned to producing its own gearbox two years ago because it was cheaper than buying the transmission from Ferrari.*']",2621,249,0.96,2621,242,242,710,28,0.0,710

Without that, many manufacturers would have left F1. FIA Technical Director Nikolas Tombazis explains.

We had to work a lot on the regulations. Especially with regard to energy management, to ensure that the cars also behave like real racing cars and have no undesirable characteristics. ""We are very happy. I think we have done well,"" Tombazis reports.

""A motor without an electric component, for example V8 motors powered by e-fuels, was not an issue. ""We have to be able to do that. If we hadn't put the engine program together as it is now, we would probably have only had two engine manufacturers,"" says Tombazis.
For the premier class, this would hardly have been sustainable.
