Once he knew he was safe, he opened up the gap to Max to 1.6 seconds within a single lap."", 'a few things:\n\n- charles’ post race radio was v out of character for him, it was clearly not just frustration about this one race but the last straw in whatever has been going on that we only ever see the tip of the iceberg of. generally he’s probably the most respectful and least shit talking driver on the grid, so i actually think it’s quite notable when he snaps.\n\n- everyone is saying it’s about p2 in the wdc but i think that’s taking one thing he said in an interview about points/norris way out of context. he’s emphasized over and over that p2 doesn’t matter that much and he’s focusing on winning the wcc. even during his emotional post race radio, he asked where mclaren finished. i’m p sure it’s bigger than that, but he isn’t about to unpack everything live in an interview.\n\nat the end of the day it’s more likely to do with the fact that charles has almost always obeyed team orders and respected the team game and team agreements, even when others do not. \n\nferrari means a lot to him personally so he def is more loyal to that, and it means something important to him. and within ferrari culture, which has its unique history/passion, that loyalty and respect is uniquely valued as well, probably moreso than other teams. charles has always embodied that, due to his personal love for the team.\n\nand when theres a teammate with a pattern of ignoring that, even if it’s understandable in some contexts, then of course it would be upsetting after a while. add the adrenaline of a race day and there you go. \n\nobviously we’ll never know all the details. but i do think that ppl talking about charles’ radio and interviews should look bigger than this one race, or even this current p2 wdc which im still confident is not the main factor at the end of the day. there’s a lot more going on and idk how much sense any of us can made of it without diving into speculation', 'Carlos races for himself and that’s understandable but I think you owe it to your teammate to respect any agreements that you both acknowledged.', ""It's probably less about this specific race but more about it being a pattern.

The lines at entrance of pit lane are considered regular track limits if driver stays out. You can see multiple times throughout history, most notably Turkey* 2021 when Perez was fighting Lewis on track and almost entered the pits, that no penalties were given for crossing the white lines at entrance.

However, if the driver does enter the pits then he must not cross the lines at the entrance.","[""Exactly like T9 in Austria where you'll practically end up crossing the pit line while on the racing line. If on some tracks it's forbidden it's a track specific situation, not a general rule (the situation you're referring to was in Turkey though).\n\nRSI commentators didn't in fact call for a Sainz penalty when he crossed the line, I'm lucky not to have to listen to Sky."", ""I think it's more than that, and not comparable it's different for every track. \n\nKarun talked about the race director's instructions but there was no boulevard, we should get some in-depth explanation in the next couple of days lol"", 'I think the confusion comes from cases where you get a penalty for that.

There's clear separation between the track and the pit entry road. Sainz practically rejoined onto the apex of a high speed corner.

Then he rejoins the festivities. First, he says: “Could anyone else become champion in this car? I would say: I wish them good luck.”\n\nThere are emotions, there is relief and, above all, Max Verstappen is happy that it's over. At least, that with two races to go he has secured his fourth championship in a row. An incredible achievement. Especially when you consider that the Red Bull driver did not have the best material for months. He himself estimates that he has not had the fastest car for seventy percent of this season. Still, things are now decided. “I had thought we would have to fight until the last moment, but then luckily the rain came in Brazil. That worked out pretty well,” Verstappen said, referring to his fabulous victory at Interlagos, which indirectly meant the knockout for rival Lando Norris.\n\n**Proving them wrong**\n\nThe intermediate score, more than three and a half hours after he crossed the finish line in Las Vegas? “I've had four beers now and two gin tonics,” said Verstappen, now holding a can of Red Bull. “Most of all, I'm pretty relieved. The race wasn't great, but actually a little better than expected. It's nice that it's done now and we can go into the final races in Qatar and Abu Dhabi reasonably relaxed. There I still want to get some nice results.” By then he has already wittily taken revenge on McLaren boss Zak Brown, by rubbing his nose in his face that he can also become world champion in a non-dominant car. Referring to earlier statements by the American about Verstappen's titles in 2022 and 2023. “Such things only motivate me. **If people are critical and think that I can only win in the best car, I prove them wrong. If I don't get credit for this now, I don't know what else I can do. Whether I would have become champion in the McLaren? Yes! And much sooner too. In 2021 in another car (the Mercedes, ed.) I would have taken the title as well. In 2022 it would have become more difficult, because Ferrari was perhaps a little too fragile then. And last year? Well, that would have been a bit trickier.”**\n\n**Not just shouting around**\n\nA roar of laughter followed, as Verstappen and Red Bull gave the concept of dominance a whole new dimension last season. At the beginning of this year, that's where things seemed to be heading as far as 2024 is concerned, too. But since early May, the panels have shifted considerably. The question is legitimate whether anyone else could have become champion in the RB20. Especially if you compare Verstappen's performance to that of teammate Sergio Pérez. “Whether it could have been? We're in Vegas, so you can maybe bet on that. I would say I wish them good luck.” Verstappen acknowledges that he is happy with how he has handled disappointments this year. Intrigues were plentiful at Red Bull, both on and off the track. As recently as early September in Monza, he said that a world title was no longer realistic. “We had quite a difficult time after a very good start. I am quite proud of how we got through that as a team. As a person it's important to stay calm and not just shout around that it all sucks. I wouldn't have been as good at that a few years ago. You learn that over the years, too. And a few championships help put it into perspective more easily.”\n\n**Never been desperate**\n\nIn Las Vegas, Verstappen stayed ahead of both McLaren drivers quite easily. Mercedes (George Russell won) and Ferrari had it better than Red Bull, though. It will be interesting next week in Qatar to see how the proportions are then. At that circuit, McLaren should normally come out well, as should Red Bull. “And we have to keep a close eye on everything...,” Verstappen is referring to the possible gimmicks McLaren might have used, at least according to Red Bull. “I'm very proud of this season, though. I never despaired, but we had a lot of conversations - including at the factory in Milton Keynes - about what we could do better. A lot has happened and it has been a tough year.” Now he stands at four world titles, as many as Alain Prost and Sebastian Vettel. And one more than, among others, his “father-in-law” Nelson Piquet. “But the first time I met him I had nothing at all... Now, fortunately, that's a different story. He also became champion in Las Vegas in 1981. He sure knows how to party here. Used to anyway.”"", 'Talk your shit king!', 'He is drunk😭 yapping anything to the interview', 'Max an hour later: Look mate I can jump over the Bellagio fountains in a single jump.
