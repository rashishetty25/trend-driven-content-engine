Let’s assume that Verstappen is (say) three tenths quicker than Lawson at this moment, intrinsically. Then add that this car is so difficult to drive that Lawson is yet to extract 3 tenths out of the car. Because he is driving this car both under and over the limit, the tyres are not in the right window, add an extra 3 tenths to that. So now you are facing almost a second of lap time difference between Verstappen and Lawson, and only three tenths of that gap is down to raw speed. The rest is about Lawson not being comfortable in the car. I know it’s just an estimate, but I don’t think that reality is vastly different. Theoretically the Red Bull is faster than the Racing Bull, but a confident Lawson in a Racing Bull is faster than a struggling Lawson in a Red Bull.\n\n>I get that the people at Red Bull say that the car is fastest the way it is set up now, but that seems a moot point if the driver is not able to extract that potential. I don’t understand that Red Bull cannot set up the second car more to Lawson’s liking (or Perez, Albon and Gasly before him).

1jipjgq,Ferrari in China hit rock bottom while the enigma of the SF-25 is revealed,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jipjgq/ferrari_in_china_hit_rock_bottom_while_the_enigma/,2025-03-24, News,,"['Focus on 2026 with immediate effect', 'If it’s truly the rear suspension design being inherently too soft and/or the new gear casing being too brittle to take the loads if the suspension is set to being harder, then Ferrari is completely done for the season, as neither change is something you can do fast, or even do at all without a chassis redesign.\n\nBy the way, article is signed by the three big names: Giuliano Duchessa, Piergiuseppe Donadoni, Rosario Giuliana - pretty much the closest we’ll get to an open admission bar a full-on statement by a team member.\n\nEdit: really the only hope is that with more kilometres racked up they might be able to find a setup that “clicks”, and that’s where Serra’s experience will be huge, but man it’s not looking good if they still got caught out by it on a super smooth track like China after the resurfacing.', 'Not the start of the season I expected, not the momentum being carried from 2024 that I too expected.\n\nThat seems like something that may not be fixed easily,...I don\'t know at the very least they must have a compliant car for the races (by that I mean a design that doesn\'t degrade the plank too much or the tyres) and that cannot wait as it would make them lose a lot of championship points and thus money AND hurt Ferrari\'s image like hell.\n\nI don\'t know how fast they can fix the rear design, depending on that complex answer, for sure, they would need to choose between an ""all in"" on 2026 or fixing their season if they believe a P2 or P3 in championship is reachable', ""Season is cooked. A situation where you can't even run the car properly without consequence is a fatal flaw. Impossible to fight for a championship like this."", 'Translation:\n\nMcLaren put the weekend back in place by dominating the Shanghai Grand Prix, while Ferrari got lost after a promising start, closing with a sensational double disqualification. Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris were able to easily control the pace of the pursuers, no one had the pace to create great concerns. The degradation was under control on each compound, Andrea Stella confirmed that by monitoring the Stroll pace (departed with the hard) “we realized that a stop was the option to perform”. Haas also benefited from a winning strategy, diversifying and adapting to the conditions.\n\nVerstappen had an ineffective start but at least he was able to return to the distance, the RB21 seems a distant relative of the previous cars. Russell tried to stay around the cars of Woking with a good texture.\n\nThe Ferraris went close to disaster at the first corner, Leclerc fought well with a broken wing, despite a balance damage quantified in 2/3 tenths. For a long phase he could have been better than the seven-time English champion, which shows how well Hamilton’s settings had gone out of the window with high load.\n\nYet the worst was yet to come. The SF-25 remains a car with unknown reactions in terms of long run. From the sprint stars to the stables of the Fia sentence an hour and a half after the race. The inspectors of the Federation measured the cars and found them non-compliant. Leclerc’s SF-25 was disqualified for less than one net weight, Lewis Hamilton’s number 44 for excessive shoe wear that protects the bottom. As well as the Alpine of Gasly the riders have been removed from the standings. The rules in terms of compliance are not questionable and it has already happened that an auto-Venturi was found with excessive consumption of the underbody however suffering a double disqualification is an unacceptable episode for any team. In both cases, Ferrari cannot have benefited in terms of performance, they are both serious but venial errors, the adjustments are simply not working in the long race, unlike the sprint. This could not go unnoticed on a smooth track as the Chinese one is currently.\n\nTHE TECHNICIANS HAVE DISCOVERED THE ENIGMA THAT FOR THE OBSERVERS STARTED BY THE BAHRAIN TESTS.\nAS FAR AS I LEARNED, THE PROBLEM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE NEW DESIGN OF THE FRONT PULL ROD SUSPENSION, MUCH LESS WITH THE AERODYNAMICS IN THE STRICT SENSE SINCE IT IS COMPLYING WITH THE STABILITY REQUIREMENTS.\n\nThe extra consumption of the plank is not a cause but a consequence. The structure of the rear air does not allow the expected stiffness, which obliges you to increase the height in a closed park to protect yourself with 100kg on board. The main clue is the rear suspension, approved in July last year, together with the new gearbox.\nThe Haas shares the mechanical parts and worked well after the Australian disaster, however it does not have the performance loading platform or the sophisticated Ferrari aerodynamics. In other words, the SF-25 struggles with the excessive softness that is compromising its operation. It looks like something already seen, for example, on the old Mercedes last year. The Red in the right conditions can generate much more load than the previous car, the sprint showed what the car could do with 35 kg of gasoline. The qualification after three hours canceled expectations again, less downforce in the curve and greater instability of the rear.\n\nLoic Serra arrived in October so relatively late on project 677. The French DT has returned to Maranello and is intervening to correct its effectiveness and reliability but clearly it is premature to formulate a solution or its timing. The problem is not easy to solve, the engineers are also working on some update areas that should be introduced new parts from Bahrain.', 'Knew it had to be the rear since haas didnt switch to the same front layout but they do get the rear end from ferrari.', 'How do you end up in this kind of mess at the last year of regulation?', ""I will give Ferrari credit for taking a risk by bringing a new car for the last season of a regulation change.

Do the current rules mean that every team is doing an estimate of how much rubber they will lose through a race and add some extra weight in their car? So if Ferrari's estimate is 500 grams and Mercedes's estimate is 700 grams, both cars start the race at different weights just because they estimate different tire wear?

Does it also mean that you have to add extra weight, just in case you want to go long on the same tire set in the end? So if you stay 30 laps on the same tires, you're legal, but if you stay out another 10 laps, suddenly you're not?

Does it also mean that a severe lockup or two during an intense battle can make your otherwise legal car illegal?

When someone crashes or has damage, we account for this weight loss by mounting a new part before weighing them or weighing them with the debris. I'm fairly sure the fuel also gets drained to account for different fuel use between cars. So why don't we account for tire loss when different cars will have different tire wear + drivers pick up different amounts of rubber marbles on their cooldown lap?

I understand why we can't remove the tires every time we use the weigh bridge in-session, but at the end of a race, we absolutely can afford to remove the tires and weigh the cars without them. So why don't we?

This feels really strange for a sport where we claim every gram matters... yet the weight of cars all over the grid can vary massively just on their estimate of how much tire they'll lose and also based on whether they stay long or not.","['The minimum of 800kg is car + minimum possible tyre weight when completely worn.

The Racing Bulls car probably has less oversteer by nature and is closer to a balanced drive. Max by nature needs an oversteering car because that's how he naturally drives. He subscribes to the theory that less steering angle means more speed, so he wants a very oversteering car so that he can easily turn the car by releasing the brake too quick or getting on the gas too quickly. In other works, a balanced car like the Racing Bulls car would feel slower to turn than the Red Bull.\n\nIt's like giving a pro gamer a low sensitivity mouse.

1jij2ac,Is Social Media Putting Undue Pressure On Teams To Make Driver Changes?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jij2ac/is_social_media_putting_undue_pressure_on_teams/,2025-03-24, Discussion,"I'd like to think that F1 teams aren't easily swayed by public sentiment in regard to how they run their driver lineups. But over the last few years it's become evident that they do, at the very minimum, see quite a bit of the social media comments and reactions to anything surrounding F1. Particularly when it comes to anything having to do with drivers. The most recent example of this being the current situation with Liam Lawson who is only 2 races into this season with people calling for him to be replaced by Yuki Tsunoda. And it seems that this motion is starting to gain traction. I don't know if this is naive or not but it doesn't seem fair to Liam that people who aren't in the team or who race the car should be able to put pressure on his team to replace him. I feel like as a young driver he should be allowed to develop like drivers are supposed to. And part of me has been wondering how much of that pressure to make changes it influenced or exacerbated by social media.

Edit: Okay, learning very quickly that F1 teams have just been utterly ruthless the whole time. For whatever reason I thought that drivers were able to stay with teams longer than they do now. ","['If team management is coming under pressure from social media then they are incompetent.', 'If social media were directing Red Bulls driver choices then Checo and Ricciardo would still be driving.', 'RB were making sudden driver changes long before F1 got the DTS boost and became as popular on social media as it is now\n\nThey had developed a reputation for being ruthless with driver changes before I was even watching the sport and not all those moves were popular with fans at the time from what I have gathered or from what friends who were into F1 before I was told me.\n\nSo they made their own bed with developing a reputation for being ruthless and then getting criticised when they give underperforming drivers chances others never got', 'If that was the case Danny Ric would’ve never lost a seat in his life.', 'Does Marko even have a smartphone?', 'No man, they kept Perez for years…', 'Things were way more harsh pre social media.
