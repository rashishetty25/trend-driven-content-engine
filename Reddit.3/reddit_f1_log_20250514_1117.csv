He'd need to finish P2 overall to even have a shot at a license though, only having 4 points to his name so far\n* Logan Sargeant: lol\n* Jak Crawford: Currently in his third F2 season with only two wins to his name despite being on a strong DAMS team.

Would need to finish P5 or higher this season to get a license outright (or P6 with practice points to compensate.)

1klugaz,Timing tower,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1klugaz/timing_tower/,2025-05-13, Discussion,"I'm watching the 2020 Sakhir GP right now because of the YouTube marathon and I realized how much I miss that timing tower.¬†


It's very readable, the contrast between all the colours is a lot better and it's shorter because only the lap counter is shown and not the big unnecessary F1 race logo (if you're watching a race, you'll know it's an F1 race... You really don't need that logo to know that) at the top that is kind of wasted space, and the gaps between the positions are not as big leading to as timing tower that doesn't extend to the bottom of the screen and isn't unnecessarily big.¬†


Also some other points:


- When the current tyres are shown, the tyre compounds symbols are so much more readable with the red/yellow/white ring around the letter that indicates the compound instead of that flimsy letter in the tyre colour we have now (where especially red does not nearly have enough contrast to the black background), the time gap is also shown to one decimal (for example 2.0) so you know the rough timing gaps AND the tyre compounds at the same time. (Also no CGI tyre compounds at the begin of the race, looks much better)¬†


- The numbers indicating the drivers' position have a white background which makes them much easier to read.¬†


- The timing background is a bit transparent so you can see some stuff that's happening when something is behind the tower.¬†


- Yellow flags actually display the sector where the yellow is shown... Why would you not show that in this year's version? Why would you only show that there's a yellow somewhere on track but not where?¬†


- The \^‚ñºindicating how many places¬† a driver has lost/gained relative to their starting position is much more readable. The ones whe have now are way to thin and the red doesn't have enough contrast in comparison to the black background, leading to bad readability.¬†


- I feel the font for the timing gaps is a tad bolder/thicker which definitely helps readability.¬†


- The inly thing I'd probably keep from the current tower might be the team logos instead of team colour stripes.


What else I'd change about the current timing tower:


- When showing battles for x position (for example battle for third) - the timing gap in the tower dissappears. So you don't know how big the gap is when two cars are fighting, even though it's pretty much the most important thing imaginable to know the gaps at that moment. So¬† it would be nice if these could be displayed again (I have seen some inserts at the bottom of the screen that do show the gaps, but they aren't always there and I'd still like them to be displayed on the actual tower, so I can keep an eye on the rest of the gaps more easily).¬†


- In qualifying, instead of showing IN LAP and OUT LAP in the space where the lap times should be, show a little symbol with I or O next to the timing gaps similarly to the P that is shown to indicate someone in their pit box.¬†


- Show us +5/+10 next to the driver's name when they get a penalty they haven't served yet. I really thought we had that in recent years, but I can't find it anywhere so maybe I'm imagining things.¬†

1klmqvx,[AMuS] Improvements for the good of sport?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1klmqvx/amus_improvements_for_the_good_of_sport/,2025-05-13, News,,"['Further dispute over 2026 engines.\n\nTranslation and full article:\n\n\n> **So far, all attempts to make major changes to the 2026 engine regulations have failed. Conservatives and reformers are unable to reach an agreement. Critics fear that the sport will suffer if improvements are not made now.**\n\n> Never before has a new set of regulations been as controversial as the one we\'re facing in 2026. Although everyone is still in the planning and testing phase, many are already seeing specters. Perhaps rightly so. The only thing that is certain is that these regulations were poorly written. Now, we have to pay the price elsewhere for issues that couldn\'t be agreed upon two and a half years ago for political reasons.\n\n> The problem with a drive system that is supposed to draw 45 percent of its total power from the battery is charging the necessary energy during racing. Without recuperation on the front axle, this is only possible with unsatisfactory alternative solutions. For example, up to 30 percent of the total fuel supply in a race is used to charge the battery via the combustion engine. And to allow the cars to coast as early as possible on the straights, active aerodynamics must drastically reduce drag by flattening the wings.\n\n> This can cause many problems. For example, depending on the battery level, it leads to significant performance differences during certain phases of the race. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner predicts two consequences: ""On the one hand, this will lead to increased lift-and-coast behavior. On the other hand, the cars will be in DRS mode practically all the time. So there will be no overtaking assistance.""\n\n> **Less electric power in the interest of sport.**\nHorner is the voice of the warning voices. Ferrari is keeping a low profile, but thinks the same way. Newcomer Cadillac is in favor of any form of simplification. As the official engine manufacturer from 2029, the Americans are now entitled to vote, but not on issues affecting the years 2026 to 2028.\n\n> FIA President Mohammed bin Sulayem has apparently sided with the Red Bull faction. The issue was high on the agenda at both the engine summit in Bahrain and the last Formula 1 Commission meeting. It appears as if the FIA \u200b\u200bpresident wants to prevent a bankruptcy. If the races degenerate into economy runs, that would backfire on the FIA. It approved these rules in August 2022.\n\n> Horner deftly poked at this wound: ""If it\'s in the interest of the sport that we avoid too much lift-and-coast, then I think it\'s worth considering reducing the electric power in racing. It doesn\'t change the specification or the performance of the engine. It\'s just about battery usage.""\n\n> **Less power, different battery.**\nProponents of a rule change had prepared charts supposedly showing that the car would still be fast with 200 kilowatts instead of 350 kilowatts from the electric reserve. The difference per lap would supposedly be only 0.6 seconds. The opposing side also considers Horner\'s statement that nothing would change in the hardware to be optimistic. Mercedes, Audi, and Honda believe that the battery architecture would have to be adapted under the circumstances. This would require a significant financial investment.\n\n> But there are also practical concerns. The teams would have to prepare for two completely different disciplines during the free practice sessions: qualifying, with around 750 kilowatts of system power (1,020 hp), and the race, in which only 600 kilowatts (815 hp) would be available.\n\n> To avoid sending cars with excessively different performance levels onto the track at the same time, free practice sessions would have to specify when to prepare for what. This would further complicate an already far too complicated set of rules.\n\n> **Unfair to change the rules of the game.**\nMercedes team principal Toto Wolff represents the group of those who want to give the 2026 regulations a chance. ""The closer we get to a new regulation, the more we all act in the interest of our teams. That\'s our duty. We don\'t know how things will go next year. Will we experience a disaster with energy recovery in Baku or Monza? We hope not.""\n\n> The Austrian doesn\'t want changes based solely on projections. The hardware must remain as it is. ""What\'s possible is within the software\'s scope. We\'ll see the final product at the tests next year. As power unit manufacturers, we want a great show. We want to win, but we\'re also aware that there has to be variability and unpredictability in this sport.""\n\n> While Mercedes enjoyed the 2014 season, when it smashed everything in the first year of its current hybrid powertrain, Wolff said, such dominance over a longer period is detrimental to the sport. ""The FIA \u200b\u200bproposed this engine. Nobody liked it. 50 percent electric drive was the direction for road cars at the time and a reason to attract manufacturers like Audi and Porsche. So we implemented it.\n\n> Wolff warns against changing the rules before a single wheel has turned. It would be unfair to those who were lured into Formula 1 by these regulations. ""Honda has recommitted itself for precisely this reason, and Audi has joined. We, too, are not interested in changing these rules at this point. But we must be open-minded and respond to grievances if necessary.""\n\n> **Sustainable fuel too expensive.**\nThere\'s already some quiet criticism of the development of sustainable fuels. With a price per liter in the three-digit range, they\'re not a relevant contribution to the series. And it\'s hitting the customer teams hard. They have to pay for the fuel. This can easily add up to additional costs of $20 million over a year. Alpine CEO Flavio Briatore admits: ""The most expensive thing right now is the bench testing with the new fuel.""\n\n> Horner explains the high prices by saying that fuel manufacturers are currently engaged in an expensive development race. ""Fuel is potentially one of the most important differentiators for engine performance. That\'s what makes it so attractive for manufacturers. Development costs money.""\n\n> Wolff adds: ""One reason for the high costs is that the entire supply chain and the energy contribution must be environmentally friendly. To achieve this, you need a certain specification of ingredients, which are very expensive. Therefore, we need to examine whether we can reduce the price per liter.""\n\n> Indeed, one must be careful when calculating prices. This includes the entire development costs from the very beginning to the first use. Since the suppliers of the molecules require certain sales volumes, this also has an impact on the initial order. Shell, ExxonMobil, BP/Castrol, Petronas, Eni, and Aramco also have to pay a high price for advertising space on their cars. All of this is passed on to the customers, and this also drives up the price per liter.\n\n> The price is actually covered by the regulation\'s requirement for a so-called drop-in fuel. It states that only e-fuels that also work in a road car, can be produced in large quantities, and can be sold at a reasonable price at a gas station are acceptable.', ""I don't remember the 2014 engines having this much negative press beforehand.\n\nHonestly though, if it's a disaster, I'm here for it. Give me some more unreliability."", ""I wonder if some people start to understand that this question isn't being raised because of an FIA presidents need to cause misdirection, now that it's been brought up so often."", '""fix your fucking car"" meets ""fix your fucking engine""', 'I agree with Wolff, give the regulations a chance and then make changes as necessary. Projections can be beneficial but don‚Äôt give the whole picture. \n\nDoomers are always reactionary and will have us go back to 1970‚Äôs. Let‚Äôs first figure this set of regulations out and then make changes as necessary.', 'Mom I want FE racing\n\nWe got FE racing at home\n\nThe fE racing at home: F1 2026', ""> The opposing side also considers Horner's statement that nothing would change in the hardware to be optimistic. Mercedes, Audi, and Honda believe that the battery architecture would have to be adapted under the circumstances.\n\nI'd be curious as to why change would be needed.       \nYou still would need to run the full 350kW mode in quali (And in the race when you are in Override Mode).        \nPlus the proposed changes did nothing to harvesting which would remain at 350kW while deployment was limited to 200kW.       \nSo it's not like you are always under cranking the battery.\n\n>To avoid sending cars with excessively different performance levels onto the track at the same time, free practice sessions would have to specify when to prepare for what.\n\nBut again, you would have that difference when the cars are in Override Mode during a race, The proposed changes were only to affect the default race mode.     \nSo it makes sense that drivers get a bit more used to it in Practice.\n\nI appreciate that a 150kW increase in power is perhaps a different kettle of fish to a 50kW increase (Albeit with 4WD and Traction Control enabled) but Formula E does  manage that difference in speed (2-3 seconds) on tighter circuits than F1 races on."", 'Ok, I read the article and...correct me if I am wrong, but much of it is the same info, lines and narratives that we\'ve read from that report on the F1 Commission meeting of theirs that they\'ve done!? Like, I think about the only new fresh stuff here is the paragraph about sustainable fuel (and even then I am not sure, too lazy to cross reference with that article)\n\nWhat I find doubly weird tho (and in pretty poor form for a site as reputable as AMuS) is this line author\'s statement at the beginning of the article:\n\n>The only thing that is certain is that these regulations were poorly written. Now, we have to pay the price elsewhere for issues that couldn\'t be agreed upon two and a half years ago for political reasons.\n\nNow, I will not pretend like I look forward towards the regs - too much of it looks like an afterthought, with some late changes made to it not inspiring any confidence (particularly in regards to the chassis and operation of the PU in race conditions), but I do think I agree with Toto (being fully aware it\'s all politics and everyone is doing things to benefit themselves first and foremost) in that we cannot state anything like this with absolute certainty until we\'ve seen the damn things hit the track.\n\nAlso - maybe they made an article about this sometime before, but I would prefer still if the author actually linked any sources, or at least elaborated more in depth about that 2nd part: ""*Now, we have to pay the price elsewhere for issues that couldn\'t be agreed upon two and a half years ago for* ***political reasons****""*', ""Anyone else getting a vibe Mercedes HPP is ahead by 2014 scale?!\xa0\n\n\nI'm trying to workout if it's that, or they're pretty keenly defending the status quo to minimise inconvenience & chaos - per their interest because they're amalgamating the development budget for PU for 4 teams (works+3 customers).

In 2025, the Formula 1 World Championship is a multi-billion-dollar industry, criss-crossing the globe over a 24-race season that captures worldwide attention every grand prix weekend.

The drama created by the world's best racing drivers is documented in the Netflix series Drive to Survive, which has helped the sport grow further in popularity in recent years. An F1 movie, starring Brad Pitt, is due to be released next month.

It's a far cry from its beginnings in 1950, when just seven races made up the first World Championship. It began with the British Grand Prix at Silverstone on 13 May, watched by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, and won by Italian Giuseppe Farina.

From Farina in 1950 to Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen and Lando Norris in 2025, F1 has produced thrills, controversy and tragedy.
