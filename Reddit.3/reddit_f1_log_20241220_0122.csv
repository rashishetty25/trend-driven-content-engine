I’m not particularly worried”,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hhwunf/vasseur_leclerchamilton_management_im_not/,2024-12-19, News,,"['Translation \n\n\nThe Lewis Hamilton – Ferrari duo will certainly be one of the most talked about topics of the next season, given that the most successful driver in F1, with 105 first places and seven world titles (like Schumacher), merges with the certainly most iconic team in the circus and that has participated continuously in the F1 world championship since 1950. To better integrate into the Italian team, as well as Loic Serra himself, the English driver is taking Italian lessons and it was no coincidence that he expressed a few words in our language already in Abu Dhabi, while entering the Ferrari box. “99% of our work is in English but I think it is nice to know how to speak a little Italian for the mechanics and for the relationship within the team” – said Fred Vasseur in this regard, who then took care to underline also in a somewhat joking manner that “it is not essential for performance”. \n\n\nVasseur: “It wasn’t difficult to convince Hamilton that the Ferrari project was excellent”\n\n\nBetween the end of last year and the beginning of 2024 , the planets aligned to bring Lewis Hamilton to Ferrari. “I think sometimes it\'s also a question of coincidences and last year they were all there, that is, Lewis was on the market and Ferrari had a seat available.” – said the Ferrari TP at the traditional Christmas lunch in Maranello, who then wanted to focus on the arguments useful for convincing the seven-time world champion to accept the offer of the Italian team. “First of all, in 2023 we won more races than Mercedes. And the start of the season had also been good, so it wasn\'t too difficult to convince him that Ferrari would be a good project . And I think he had been thinking about driving for Ferrari for at least 20 years because we were already discussing it in 2004,” revealed the French manager.\n\n\nThe seven-time world champion will arrive at Ferrari after a very long experience in a team like Mercedes , quite different in its working methods and without that Niki Lauda who was fundamental initially and who made the environment within the Anglo-German team very special. “I am not sure that we have to do a copy and paste of what Mercedes did, where the environment worked very well at the beginning, a little less at the end.” – said Vasseur – “My objective in fact is not to do a copy and paste of what has been done in the past, or to try to attract all the people from Mercedes and to create a Mercedes team that have not been champions in the last two or three years, but to find the best way to manage Lewis differently with our team, with our guys and our resources”. \n\n\n\nVasseur believes that managing the Leclerc-Hamilton duo will be even easier than the Leclerc-Sainz duo \n\n\nMuch of the curiosity of the insiders during the next season will be to understand and see how Fred Vasseur will be able to manage the desire of Charles Leclerc to enter the history of Ferrari by winning his first world title and that of a seven-time world champion who would further enter the history of F1 by becoming the first driver to win 8 world championships, the last with a Ferrari that has not won it since the now distant 2007 (drivers). ""This year my challenge was to manage Charles and Carlos, but I think it was part of our performance because I am truly convinced that emulation in the team is the key to the performance of the entire team , "" said the French manager, who thinks in a way that is practically opposite to the Red Bull identity, where all the efforts are concentrated on the Verstappen side of the box. \n\n\n“We had a couple of heated moments between Charles and Carlos. Monza 2023 or even Las Vegas 2024 for example. But in the end, I think it was beneficial for the team’s performance .” – said Vasseur, who then wanted to explain how these sporting disagreements have never damaged the Scuderia in terms of points collected – “Managing Charles and Lewis? I’m not particularly worried, given that they have a huge mutual respect and know each other well. They have been talking about their future relationship for months now. And I think it’s much better to fight for the very first positions on the grid rather than fighting for the last and I think it’s a good problem for a team to have this type of discussion .

That being said, it's crazy to think how much of an effect Piastri has had on the current F1 landscape.  Alpine had him as a reserve with Alonso and Ocon as drivers. Alpine strung Alonso along knowing that they eventually wanted Oscar in that seat. Alonso as a result bolts, and Alpine loses a WDC champion driver. 

Then Oscar also leaves, and suddenly the cupboards are bare. Alpine sign Pierre from RB which was a good signing so we'll leave it at that for Alpine.  McLaren scoop up Piastri, and as a result, Danny Ric is bought out.  He sits out for a year*... 

The freed up spot at Alpha Tauri goes to De Vries. Nyck struggles, and after half a year, is sent back to Formula EEeeeEeee.  * Danny Ric takes his spot.

Three races later, Oscar spins out in a practice session. Instead of hitting him, Danny Ric who had a lot of momentum at the time, avoids him and hits the wall instead, breaking his hand.

Enter Liam Lawson, who takes Daniel's spot in the AT for the next 8 (?) races, and impresses tremendously. Danny comes back, and takes his spot back. 

Liam Lawson is brought back, but only as a reserve driver in the following season, surprising many. It's clear that he will be taking either DR's or Yuki's spot at some point.  DR struggles and as a result he's yeeted out of his car with 6 races to go. 

In those 6 races, Liam does enough to prove to RB that he's capable of driving for the parent team, and that he's a better candidate than Yuki. Sergio loses his spot, and Liam is promoted.

And none of this happens without Oscar.","['I think you’re forgetting Vettel. \n\nHe retired on his own so that was the opening that left an open seat that Alonso grabbed and left an open spot Piastri didn’t even want.', 'butterfly effect innit', 'I mean, yes, McLaren poached Oscar once they saw the mess Alpine got themselves into, but I’m pretty sure they would’ve fired Daniel either way after that terrible 2022 season and just put someone else in there.

Then Hamilton and Rosberg happened and Red Bull started this driver program epidemic and all of a sudden there was this barrier of “we want an experienced driver in the top car and can use our junior team or a team we have a connection with to foster talent” (George at Williams, Leclerc at Alfa). But now I think they just don’t care anymore or see less value in having an established 1 driver with a steady 2nd that won’t challenge them. Red Bull lost all their good assets while Perez and Ricciardo were there. They’re in the rebuild of their young driver program kind of. Yuki clearly has a glass ceiling. Max is max. So you have two seats to fill that were blocked by old slow guys. Throw the young kids in there and see what happens. Same thing with Antonelli at Mercedes.

That for sure pissed off people at Redbull given how money and politically charged F1 decision making is. Yuki has been improving year after year for his 4 years on the grid but they say Liam came and did cumulatively a better job in a much shorter period of time (11 races?). We won’t ever know what other factors were considered but given the politics and money of F1 decision making, it certainly had to have played a non negligible factor. It’s also worth noting that Yuki is an alumni of Honda racing but he’s not managed by Honda anymore so he has the ability to look around- but also he doesn’t come with a ton of sponsor backing so he’s limited in his ability to buy into a seat so I’m sure Honda provides some form of financial support.', 'tsunoda is a honda backed driver, even a honda junior if i remember correctly.\n\nthere are many rumors around why it went like that. my subjective take on that is (and you will never read facts about that sadly) that red bull are pissed off by honda because of their recent in-and-out-of-f1-mentality which ended up for red bull to set up their own power train factory (humongus financial investment) just to watch honda a few months later announcing they rejoin f1 with aston martin.\nand since yuki was brought to RB by honda thats their way of payback.\nas i said thats my take on that by witnessing what happened over the recent years', 'This entire comment sums it up nicely.\xa0', 'thats totally what i was reading out of all the official statements. nice sum up, better details than mine!']",0,4,0.36,0,4,4,0,0,-0.020000000000000018,0

I think it would make sense to pair Tsunoda with whichever American driver Cadillac decides to thrown into their car. Firstly I know he’s associated with Honda and the typical move would be to Aston Martin, but depending on Lance and Papa strolls plans that might not be realistic to get a drive in 2026. But you put him in a Cadillac I think he’d succeed. He’d be the senior driver of the two (which he has experience with Nick and Lawson), he has a hunger and fire in him that I think would mesh well with American fans, and Japan and Honda has a huge presence here in the states. I could see him contrasting well with whatever American personality you put next to him and it would work from a marketing and sports racing perspective. I think he’s matured a lot, has learned a lot, and I genuinely a top 12 driver on the grid. Let me know if this is wishful thinking but as an American I’d love to see him in a Cadillac!","[""Fuck me some of these reactions to the news are ludicrous.

1hhpb3x,the Yuki bias?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hhpb3x/the_yuki_bias/,2024-12-19, Discussion,"I don't get all the Yuki love. I mean sure he's lovable but is that enough to get the RB seat? Feels more like a train everyone had boarded, logic be darned. Not saying he's a bad driver or that he doesn't deserve the seat, as he did his time but Lawson just makes way more sense.

Trial by fire because the grid in 2025 is going to be tight. That's the RBR way, feels like a return to old ways. Lawson is going to have to be up to the task, swim or sink. If he swims they'll have a good partnership for 2026. If he sinks, they'll get another, more experienced driver off the market for 2026.

Also Yuki's contract has one more year on it, Honda and their weird decision (again) to leave F1 hurt Yuki more than anything. Getting Yuki, they'd have to get a fresh driver for 2026, an year of unknowns. Better to have someone next to Max that has had some lashes of the whip that is going to be 2025. If Honda had stayed and got on the RBRPT project, 100% Yuki would have gotten the seat.

Having said that and Honda going to Stroll. Yuki in an AM vs Lawson in RBR in 2026 is going to be spicy.","['I mean we’re saying ‘trial by fire’ but that didn’t work for Gasly or for Albon then they went with the experienced driver and that worked for multiple years before going downhill. Other than Max it’s just not worked and do we think Liam is another Max? Even Max had a full year at Toro Rosso with some mega performances which showed everyone that he was something special. \n\nI think the frustration is that Yuki has always shown he’s quick but he had to tone down his temper and become more consistent which he’s shown to have done. Other than the one incident at the beginning of the year he’s remained calm and consistent since. He’s also consistently outperformed every teammate he’s had. I think people are frustrated about this in the same way they were frustrated at Checo’s poor performance being allowed to go on so long.\n\nI hope Liam does well but I also hope Yuki can get out of the RB circus and get a chance to shine.', ""Truth is that no one 'deserves' a seat in f1. There will always be factors outside that play a role in who gets the seat. Tsunoda is a pretty good driver, but he isn't what RBR want"", 'There are much more nuisances in this situation than what Yuki deserves and what Lawson does not deserve.\n\nOn Lawson, is he a good drive with more potential? Yes. Is he an immediate WDC contender that can challenge Max? We can quite confidently say no. Not able to beat an experienced driver like Yuki does not mean he is bad, but it proves he doesn’t show his potential yet. For this type of driver, there is no rush to promote him, and giving him time to develop in the junior team is the best scenario to shape him into a reliable rear gunner. Why can’t he do that in RBR? To my opinion, RBR is not really a team for development. Their patience is thin, and they expect him to perform immediately, in a car that in 2024 even Max said sometimes it is not easy to drive. The constant pressure to a driver who only drove 11 races is a lot. Lawson could navigate it very well, and that means he will be with Max long term. If it doesn’t go well, RBR WCC position takes another hit with only one driver delivering for the team again. Fast tracking Lawson could setback his career development.\n\nDo I support RBR to promote Yuki because he deserves it? No. Do I expect he would be competitive against Max? No. Do I think he could contribute more than Lawson in the immediate term? To some extent, Yes. Yuki is objectively more ready to take the RBR seat within the RB stable, given his performance and also experience, and also let Lawson to develop more. If he is really really good, RBR can keep him until they see the next Max regardless of the Honda deal. Honda was clear thst they will support Yuki even he is not driving with their engines. If he is not good, RBR wants to sack him anyway, there are no harms.\n\nThe only reason for RBR to pick Lawson over Yuki now is if they think Lawson will perform better immediately in 2025 alongside Max which I am not convinced. I am more inclined to say RBR wants to burn through their Junior drivers until they have Linblad ready to drive for RBR. \n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.', 'I mean I think one of the biggest arguments is that because Yuki would be out 2026, there’s no harm in putting him in for 2025. If he sucks then they can drop him anyways. And having Liam in vcarb gives him more time and experience to develop as a driver without the harm of having max as your teammate.

1hhpk72,Why do people think Tsunoda over Lawson. Tsunoda is a Honda driver.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hhpk72/why_do_people_think_tsunoda_over_lawson_tsunoda/,2024-12-19, Discussion,"TL;DR - Tsunoda is a Honda driver, not an RB one.

Liam Lawson was the obvious choice surely? Tsunoda being a Honda driver, he’s probably going to leave for Aston Martin in 2026 following either Alonso’s retirement or then finally dropping Stroll. I know he’s had a large majority of his career with the RB family but he’s only there thanks to Honda supplying the engine.

Knowing this, Red Bull don’t want someone who’ll be there for a year then leave, they want someone young to potentially be Verstappen’s successor (Ricciardo to Vettel).

With Hadjar most likely getting the vacant VCARB spot, if Lawson pulls a Gasly, I can see RB going for Hadjar instead of Tsunoda too. 

No shade on Yuki, on his day he can be amazing. I just don’t think Red Bull will want to waste time and money on a driver they know won’t be there next year.","['Alonso has a contract 2026 and stroll has an infinite contract, there is no space for him at Aston?!', '> Tsunoda being a Honda driver, he’s probably going to leave for Aston Martin in 2026\n\nWell, no, because why would he do that if he has a race-winning car?', ""Tsunoda getting into F1 with Honda does not at all mean he has to stay with them several years after the fact. It's such a weird idea that this would be the case, when for all other drivers we are open to movement between teams according to their performance. Especially since Tsunoda *also* has been a driver for a Red Bull team even if he didn't come from their junior program. If Tsunoda performed better than Lawson it would be very natural to give him an offer to drive in the Red Bull car."", ""The biggest reason is experience. Maybe people wouldn't be as hesitant about Lawson being promoted if he had more than 11 GP under his belt, like a full season or 2. Though that didn't help Gasly. \n\nBoth would probably falter alongside Max Verstappen, very few can probably keep up with him honestly, I just hope he can do better than Perez.\n\nAlso being a Honda driver shouldn't mean squat."", 'If you think Alonso will retire before the 2026 season where there is a new set of regulations and an Adrian Newey designed car you are insane!', ""Because Tsunoda is better and if offered would jump at the chance. Also I'm sure if needed he'd happily break the Honda link if it meant getting the chance to win races."", ""I don't even think its about Honda. Red Bull have the power to buy Yuki away from Honda and make him a Red Bull driver. \n\nThey just think that he has reaches his ceiling and that this is his pace. Clearly it isn't enough. They see Lawson holding his own against Yuki despite much less experience and are willing to take the slim chance that Lawson will grow much further into a driver that can support Max. \n\nThe choice between Yuki and Liam was one where Yuki would have definitely struggled and one where Liam will struggle at the start but may grow."", 'There is no way Lawrence Stroll is replacing a 2x world champion with Yuki Tsunoda. There is a pattern there. He is going after a top driver once Alonso retires.', 'For the reason you stated Yuki is a Honda driver promote him let Max destroy him and then get rid of him next year if that’s what happens, alternatively he impresses and you make him a RB driver not a Honda one. Let Lawson and Hadjar find their feat at racing bulls and promote the better looking option in 2026. Nothing I’ve seen of Liam right now makes me think he would be superior to Yuki in the RB seat.']",0,65,0.26,0,324,324,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
