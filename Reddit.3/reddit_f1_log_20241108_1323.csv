Same thing for ints, if wets weren't used, but someone bolts on ints, the whole race is 'int'. Otherwise it's 'dry'.

However:\n\nIn the last four years (2021-2024):  \n\\- There were seven GPs that had at least one red flag when only dry tires were used  \n\\- There were two GPs that had at least one red flag when ints were used at some point  \n\\- There were four GPs that had at least one red flag when wets were used at some point  \n\\- There were five GPs that had NO red flags, but where ints were used  \n\\- There was one GP that had NO red flags, but where wets were used\n\nSo yeah, statistically 4/5 times that the wet tires were used there was a red flag during that GP.  \nAnd 5/7 times that the int tires were used, there was a red flag during the GP.  \nSo 9/12 times that drivers moved off of the dry tires, there has indeed been a red flag (3/4s of the time). But that's 9/19 times that a red flag was shown in a GP in total (less than half), so how much the wet weather tires contribute to red flags is hard to interpret.

Sort of like an inverse Norris.

He didn't put a foot wrong in Hungary 2021 when Vettel was in his DRS for 60+ laps. Later that year in Jeddah, he again made no mistakes while at the front and only lost the podium because he [lost a piece of his floor with 2 laps to go](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/ocon-floor-damage-cost-me-in-saudi-f1-podium-battle-with-bottas/6856759/), before that he was almost matching Bottas' times. In Suzuka 2022, he qualified in the top 5 and finished P4 after defending against Hamilton the whole race. Monaco 2023 was simply a superb qualifying lap followed by a strong performance in the race, where Sainz was heavily pressuring him in the first stint and almost crashed into him. And finally last weekend, where I believe he had a shot at winning if Sainz didn't cause another red flag.

It's unlikely that Haas will have a frontrunning car anytime soon but I think he will bring the team their first podium. His ability to just soak in the pressure at the front is undeniable.","['Ocon is underrated, but I also don’t believe in this idea that he “performs better” on the rare occasion he is at or near the front. Ocon is simply imo a very clean driver that rarely makes mistakes hence why he sometimes has a nickname of “Oconsistency”. He doesn’t do a lot of aggressive overtakes, but he can pull off very smart and clean overtakes like when he did the switchback to get past both Alonso and Lawson at the COTA sprint race, and his double overtake two years ago in Spa.\n\nMost of the time when Ocon makes mistakes or collisions in wheel to wheel combat it happens with his teammate. For some reason Ocon gets too aggressive with his teammates a few times which simply feels self destructive imo. \n\nOcon and Gasly are easily the 5th best lineup on the grid and both are highly credible midfield drivers that can take advantage of chaos and score a podium or even a win when the rare opportunity arises for them both. \n\nIt is a pity for most of the season they haven’t had a better car to showcase their talents, but I’m glad they both capitalized on it beautifully at Brazil.', 'He’s not one of the only ones, but he’s definitely good at it.\n\nNo chance he was going to win though.

When we look back beating Max Verstappen during his peak WDC years will look to have been as difficult as it is - almost impossible, even in a second-best car. It’s been a tough end to the chase under intense scrutiny but overall I think Norris can be proud of the season, though I would say he needs to secure P2 and McLaren the WCC in order to be really happy with it.', 'Perez has been in the title-winning car the last three seasons.

If he helps McLaren win the Constructor\'s, it\'s still a good season and I think the team haven\'t helped with their own variety of strategy errors.

His WDC challenge fell off a cliff and he made some mistakes, but he's hardly out there Maldonadoing himself out of races, four top teams are all relatively close in terms of performance (which is double the norm), and he's up against *Max Verstappen*. Lando entered new territory for himself this season, and while it didn't ultimately go the way he wanted it to, I think he'll come back stronger from it if McLaren can continue this momentum into 2025.

I do think though that he’ll learn from this season and if he’s in a championship battle again next year he’ll be much better prepared for it. \n\nHe deserves criticism yes but not the amount he’s getting.
