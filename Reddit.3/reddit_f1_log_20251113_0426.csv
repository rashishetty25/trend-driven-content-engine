1ouzdb2,Has the testing ban/limits stunted Ferrari performance?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ouzdb2/has_the_testing_banlimits_stunted_ferrari/,2025-11-12, Technical,"I recently listened to the High Performance Podcast where they spoke with Miki Hakkinen.

And one of the things Miki spoke about was his frustration that Ferrari were able to test so much more than McLaren (or any other team).

He basically said that after a bad race he knew Monday morning, Ferrari would be out on their test track. That as soon as a season was over, they'd be on their test track. And there was no limit to how long they could test for each day.

In contrast, McLaren had to go to Silverstone, where they could only run between 10:00 and 17:00 and it would be raining.

This got me thinking, that a lot of Ferrari's woes have come since the testing ban. Was their test track and near unlimited testing their golden goose?

Do you think Ferrari failed and still struggle with the limited testing? Unable to properly utilise simulation and wind tunnel and much perfered real world running to teat upgrade parts?","['I mean yeah. Thats a given.\n\nA track on the doorstep of your factory that you own will always be a massive benefit to you when you can test on it whenever you want and for how long you want.\n\nFerrari had cars running at Fiorano non stop back in the day. Schumacher who was a testing freak himself literally traveled from some European tracks to Fiorano to test mid race weekend.', ""*Mika.\n\nAnd yes, it's been an ever growing issue for years. Ferrari and Lotus were once the only teams with their own race tracks. Lotus had Hethel and of course Ferrari had Fiorano. \n\nOf the two, only Fiorano became a world class facility, and Ferrari used it a LOT. Elio de Angelis famously said he would never drive for Ferrari because he didn't want to live at Fiorano, he may have been exaggerating a little during the 80's but by the time Michael Schumacher arrived at Ferrari in 1997 that's exactly what Michael did - lived in an apartment (Enzo's old apartment actually) right on the circuit. Testing everyday and sometimes into the evening when it was practically dark.\n\nThis was of course a huge advantage for Ferrari and something that by this stage no other team could do."", 'No, i’ve heard somewhere they have the best mechanics and engineers. So shoulnt be a big thing', ""It's Mika Häkkinen"", ""Of course it impacted their performance but there's no excuse for not being able to adapt to it for this long.\n\nThere's a more recent example of severely reduced performance by 1 team since the cost cap has been introduced, I'll let you figure out which team it is :)"", 'During the Schumacher years ferrari were relentless. At one point in 1998 Schumacher did 1400 km in 3 days at Fiorano - so over 5 Grand Prix distances. It was a key part of their success back then; very much how Mercedes did so well in the early hybrid earlier by simply outspending everyone else and developing multiple versions of everything.\n\nGood read on it here [http://atlasf1.autosport.com/98/bel/schumacher.html](http://atlasf1.autosport.com/98/bel/schumacher.html)', 'I’m sure it’s absolutely impacted Ferrari. However, it impacts all the other teams too. \n\nOther teams have seemingly adapted to the switch and having to use the digital world and simulation. Ferrari seems to struggle adapting to this. \n\nI was also listening to a podcast (I can’t remember which one). They mentioned that Ferrari designs their cars trying to take advance of Loopholes. When the loopholes close they are kind of screwed. I think they used the flexiwing as an example but again I forget.

With the new regulations coming in in 2026 there will probably be some shuffling in performance between the teams. What I wonder specifically, is how this will affect McLaren.

As we all know, one of the advantages of making your own engine is that the architecture and general construction can be adapted to the kind of car your team wants to build. Now, I assume (maybe wrongly), that the engine freeze from 2022-2025 also more or less locked in the architecture of the Mercedes engine, allowing McLaren to eventually overtake them in performance.

So I wonder (and I hope there is someone more technically versed than me), if there is a chance that the new Mercedes car goes into a different direction than the McLaren and that the McLarens will struggle (at least in the first season) to come to terms with the new engine.","[""As likely as it is for any team.

I think someone made the point on here that McLaren haven’t brought an upgrade that failed to perform as expected (if not better) since at least the beginning of 2023 .

Gasly, speaking to Canal Plus F1 , emphasized that Alpine 's true focus is on the 2026 season, when the team will be powered by Mercedes engines. “Unfortunately, we're last in the championship this year, but perhaps next year we can say 'fortunately.' We have more time in the wind tunnel than all the other teams; we're in an advantageous position ,” the driver stated.

This “advantageous position” refers to the difference between the teams that will have Mercedes engines and those that will face greater technical difficulties with other suppliers. Gasly added: “ There are teams that will be ‘eliminated’ at the start of the 2026 season because of their engines. From what I hear, other engine manufacturers are having a much harder time.

1ov7nqk,New regulations for 2026 predictions,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ov7nqk/new_regulations_for_2026_predictions/,2025-11-12, Discussion,Since we have a weekend off racing i thought id get everyones opinion on next year. There are some significant changes to regulations and everyone is pretty much starting from scratch. My bold prediction is that Aston Martin will make a big leap with Newey at the Helm. The man is an Aero genius and next year with no DRS aero will be more important than ever.  I also think Cadillac will come in strong as a new team with two experienced drivers. Have been following their progress and it seems like they are throwing it all in on the team. ,"['Prediction will be that the top 4 is the same in different places depending on reliability', 'Red Bull to flub the engine, Aston Martin to improve but at most to sometimes podium contention, Audi a bit meh, Cadillac dead last.', 'Whoever gets the best PU wins in 26, I don’t think aerodynamics will kick in until a year later, though I would bet money on someone pushing the active aero to its limit. Maybe even an unorthodox design like mercs zeropods.\n\nReliability is going to be a mess, so I expect every team to score at least a few points, maybe we’ll even see a few new grand prix winners.\n\nNewey is a ground effect genius, but we are going back to flat floors, with wheelbase and rake being highly regulated. Honda engines also have a reputation of being a bit of a wildcard.\n\nI don’t expect Cadillac to hit the ground running but with solid drivers that Perez and Bottas are they might end up in the midfield mix. Somewhere around Williams.\n\nAs for drivers, the next year is going to be important for this year’s rookies, especially Antonelli and Bearman. With whatever is happening in with Scuderia lately they might put their names on the map.', 'What’s even more intriguing for me is, who besides Cadillac will be last? \n\nCan’t be probably one of the top 4. \n\nWilliams doubt it, trajectory seems up.\n\nHaas can be likely especially if the Ferrari engine is just the 3rd best\n\nVCARB also pretty likely, but they were never the worst teams in a season\n\nAudi is also pretty likely \n\nAston Martin better not be\n\nAlpine should also not be last after concentrating nearly all year for 2026 + Mercedes engine, but they do have it in them to mess up', 'Russell vs Norris vs Piastri for the WDC.\xa0', 'Mclaren and Mercedes are the teams to beat.

Alonso signs off his career with one last win and the only other non Mercedes powered win goes to Leclerc.\n\nVerstappen does his usual and works miracles in a Red Bull that is now in the upper midfield, held back by the RBPT engine. The car concept is easier to drive than the ground effect concept and Hadjar has a decent showing (though no podiums). Any remaining podiums are swept up by Williams and Alpine as Mercedes customers.\n\nHaas and Audi score occasional points. Bearman continues to develop and rumours begin on him joining Ferrari in the near future.\n\nBack of the grid is Racing Bulls and Cadillac, the former not able to make the best of their engine package like the senior team and the later very much in a learning year.', 'Williams will be closer but still will be too far to consistently podium.

The team with the best drivers wll figure out how to use the new toys best but it will take time.\n\nEarly news state that Mercedes and Ferrari are pursuing similar engine designs but Honda is doing something very different. Now I'm not betting on Ferrari to beat Mercedes in an engine war so if Honda delivers, top 3 will consist of Mercedes, Mclaren and Aston Martin. With Ferrari behind those 3.\n\nFurther down I'm not expecting RBPT to be good at all just like Audi.\n\nBonus, I'm expecting Alpine to do unusually well just like Williams did in 2014."", 'Stroll 26,27,28']",0,97,0.48,0,267,267,0,0,0.0,0

1ov2ckt,I ran this in google colab! Norris needing only 1 podium and 3 P5's,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ov2ckt/i_ran_this_in_google_colab_norris_needing_only_1/,2025-11-12, Discussion,"https://preview.redd.it/h0dkhthu1t0g1.png?width=1323&format=png&auto=webp&s=15e9ab525d74e4b2e4a025c2e11d20b9ac7ae4bd

I used google colab for this if there is some error don't grill me for it. I just wanted to see what would be the possible combinations for Norris to win the title. If someone finds an error I'll delete the post.  
  
Norris would win the title with just one podium and 3 minimum P5's with Max winning all and Oscar in P2 always. This is the most lazely way Norris could win the title.

I am a Verstappen fan so this is the closest fight we can get for Max to win the title I believe because by the season end Max would have more wins than Lando and that would give the title to Max.
