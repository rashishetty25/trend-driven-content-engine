AutoModerator will no longer be granting Hulkenpodium flairs**

Welcome to Thread #5! The original thread had blown up so much, the admins asked us to kindly lock it and set up a new one as it was causing too much stress on Reddit's servers. We will set up a new thread every time the number of comments starts causing issues. So we're back with another thread for everyone who hasn't yet claimed their special flair. Original post below:

---

In the past days we received a lot of requests for special flairs celebrating Hulkenberg's podium.

So in order to properly commemorate this historic event we decided to create a limited edition flair, featuring a limited edition emoji made by u/Blanchimont.

This flair can only be claimed in the next 27 hours. So if you want to have proof so that you can brag to all the future members of the community that you were here when history was made, this is your chance. If you change your flair back after the 27 hours you will not be able to recover the limited edition flair.

To claim this flair all you have to do is to send a comment under this post including the words ""Hulkenpodium"" or ""Hulkengoat"" (and pray that AutoModerator doesn't crash and burn)

Edit: It can take a bit of time for Automod to get to you, so please don't spam if it doesn't update immediately. Right now there seems to be a processing delay of \~4 minutes

Edit 2: To all of those suddenly requesting to be unbanned via modmail, please be patient. To all of those requesting to be unbanned via DMs... Please don't

1lvuyy0,No situations for wet tyres.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lvuyy0/no_situations_for_wet_tyres/,2025-07-09, Discussion,"I must say I find it pretty annoying that there seems to be an overlap between intermediate tyres and SC/VSC/üö©. At Silverstone it seemed like Race Control had a perfect opportunity to let the teams squabble with tyre choices, as the forecast said there would be around ten minutes of rain, and no more to follow.

The obvious quandary is about safety, and as Martin Brundle said on commentary, he agreed with the decision of the safety car, because the standing water started to endanger the cars of aquaplaning. Personally I think a VSC would be sufficient in that instance, if anything, particularly for letting Piastri keep his advantage.

I remember that less than a decade ago, half of the pack used wet and the other half intermediate tyres in conditions like that, and I'm wondering what has changed to make the organisers take more precaution. I'm also wondering what other people's thoughts and opinions are, hence this post.

I clearly don't want drivers in danger, but like we often say, they are professionals and we need to trust that they will take precaution too. I think I lean towards letting them drive and enjoying the peril as a spectator, not of damage or injury, but of race-changing incidents due to the challenging conditions.","[""> I'm wondering what has changed to make the organisers take more precaution\n\nIt is the aero design of this regulation. It wasn't as bad in the beginning when teams were figuring it out still and having to raise ride height, but they've all dialed in so much now that the cars all produce more spray. So the increased spray combined with conditions that would warrant wet tires mean that visibility is not good enough to race safely where it would have been in past years, plus I think the sport is just more safety-minded in general now. That's my understanding at least. Happy to hear if others think there are other factors."", 'What changed is that the current generation of cars generate so much spray that when the conditions are bad enough for wets, visibility is dangerously bad. No amount of trusting drivers to ‚Äútake precautions‚Äù matters when they can‚Äôt see anything more than 20 yards in front of them.', ""I feel it's a very mixed situation. \n\nThe wet tires are to no use at this moment. The spray that they, in combination with this era of ground effect cars, cause limits visibility so much that you cannot safely drive, let alone race. So by the time the weather becomes bad enough, it's time for a Safety car or a Red flag even. The Dutch GP of 2023 showed that really well. \n\nAlso it doesn't help that the crossover between Inters and Wets is at that same point where racing just becomes impossible. So teams tend to just stick to Inters, because chance is more likely that race is gonna get neutralized at that point anyway. \n\nAnd the reason to get a Full Safety car over a VSC, wasn't to ruin Piastri's advantage. It was for the safety of all drivers. Remember that Bernd Mayl√§nder has all the information on track conditions, if there is a really wet part of the track he can limit the pace of all cars and have them evade especially risky puddles. while the movement of the cars, especially in closer proximity of each other, works really well to dry the track out. That's why sometimes after a heavy rain before a race start, they have 2-3 or even 4 formation laps, just to dry the track out. \n\nBut we'll see, Pirelli said that the usability window for wets should be better. And i hope the design of the 2026 cars limit spray somewhat more so we can actually have racing in the wet."", 'They can‚Äôt use the full wet because the amount of spray generated by an amount of water necessitating the full wet + the spray generated by the floor is extreme and visibility goes to zero.', 'Forecast was rain in ten minutes, initially light then heavier before tailing off. Not ‚Äòdry in ten minutes‚Äô \n\nIn Brazil they originally let them squabble. It brought out the red flag as certain teams stuck certain drivers on inters for speed and those drivers couldn‚Äôt do it. We got a red flag.\n\nRed flags are what race control are trying to avoid. SC for a few laps avoided the a red flag.', 'Beside the spray issues, Pirelli has stated that the wet tyres are overwhelmed by water in really heavy rain, because they cannot get proper data on using these car in the wet due to the races being stopped in bad conditions.', 'As a related issue, do safety cars actually make wet situations less safe? \n\nBy bunching cars up and then releasing them with cold tyres in wet conditions aren‚Äôt you just increasing the likelihood of a crash.
