1nbjq85,A reminder that Albon making it to F1 at all was nothing short of a minor miracle,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nbjq85/a_reminder_that_albon_making_it_to_f1_at_all_was/,2025-09-08, Discussion,"For me at least, Albon has been the best driver of 2025. More than any other, he's been the one to constantly get the results, even when the car wasn't at its best. But I think it's important to remember that there was a time where Albon making it to F1 at all was incredible.

In case you didn't know, Albon was good in the junior series, but not in a way that indicated that he was an F1 prospect (granted that's mainly down to him not having the budget to race for the biggest teams). For me at least, Albon wasn't even on my radar in any way until the 2016 GP3 series, where he finished runner up to Charles Leclerc, but I never expected him to be in the running for an F1 seat.

F2 in 2018 was a massively competitive and hyped up driver lineup, with Lando Norris and George Russell in particular getting most of the hype, with Nick De Vries being the most hyped up veteran. Alex Albon had very little hype, most likely down to him not even being signed up until the last minute (and even then it was on a race by race basis).

F2 2018 starts off, and Russell and Norris were two of the main title contenders. With them being both rookies and British, Sky F1 hyped them up a lot, but with all that said, Alex Albon never let them disappear. It was always fairly close between Russell, Norris and Albon, yet the former two always had a lot more hype than Albon did.

In fairness to Sky F1, a bunch of their pundits did eventually realise that Albon did deserve to be in the same conversation as Russell and Norris. I remember Martin Brundle tweeting to the effect of *""We hyped up Russell and Norris a lot, but why not Albon? He's right up with them two in the standings, why aren't we talking about him more?""*

Eventually that did indeed happen, and on the F2 broadcast at least, Albon was discussed a lot more, especially by the end of the season. But despite all this, F1 seemed all but impossible for him. So much that he signed up for Formula E for the 2018-19 season.

But fortunately for Alex, all the right dominos fell into place. Ricciardo moved to Renault for 2019, which saw Red Bull promote Gasly into Red Bull. Even then though, Gasly was replaced with Kvyat, and it was obvious that Red Bull wanted to replace Hartley with Ticktum, however Ticktum lost to Schumacher in European F3, which meant he couldn't earn his superlicense for 2019. All of this had to happen in order for Alex Albon to get the 2019 Toro Rosso seat, and even then a bunch of Hartley fans were unhappy at the announcement.

There were still rumblings online about how well Albon would do at Toro Rosso. I remember some predictions placing him dead last for 2019, but seeing him now, in his sixth year in F1, and performing to a better and higher standard than ever, it's amazing to think that there was a time where nobody thought he'd even be close to an F1 seat.","[""Owes a lot of it to Jean-Paul Driot of DAMS who could see the potential and supported him for that 2018 season so they could get him in the Nissan e.dams team.\n\nUnfortunately for JPD, Helmut came calling at testing and he knew it would be pointless to try and stand in Alex's way."", ""Albon just goes to show how fine the margins can be to getting that F1 chance. Tons of drivers like him that have the talent for F1 but just dont get that break. \n\nIt's wierd to think of an alternate timeline where he is a top FE driver but because of that isn't seen as an F1 calibre driver."", 'George Russell is fully aware of Albon’s under the radar talent. If you watch his interviews over the years whenever he is asked about Albon George always start off with how talented Alex is. Then he goes on to joke about how the only reason he can beat Alex is with better cars and bikes. He even admitted his push for Williams to sign Albon was part friendship but that it was all on merits that he believed Alex is the best driver available for Williams at the time.', 'I pray for the day for Albon to get a podium finish in a Williams. Simply because both he and the team deserves it.', 'Seems like the paddock always knew, never questioned:\n\n-Lando said kept a poster of Albon on wall when younger in karting \n-Russell not only advocated for Williams seat, there’s a clip from back in the day where he angrily defended Albon to a reporter when asked about RB dropping \n-Horner seems to recognize and credited for work on Sim when demoted, helped get a set at Williams \n-Other TP spoke highly of him, Gunther and Toto \n-Jost Capito obviously saw something in him and data to have signed back into F1 \n-Carlos said in interview when joining team he asked around about Alex, both Lando and Charles said you’ll be surprised he’s really quick.\n\nMy favorite story is how he reflected that once dropped, not racing meant he had no way for anyone to see his skills, thought his time at RB wasn’t as bad as being dropped implied so researches his data and compiled a spreadsheet which he went around and shared with anyone that would meet with him. Jost took the chance and you have to wonder if it was as much for his tenacity as it was for skill. \n\nHe’s good in wet, good at tire mgmt, great at defending, known for his  engineering input, and has pace but probably his best attribute is his attitude. \nThink this helps on track too, focused driving by taking opportunities where presented, creating own and not compounding issues when things are going wrong. Perseverance, talent and his Buddhist approach makes him very likable and respected thruout paddock. \n\nAlso further confirms just how special that rookie class of 2019 turned out to be, throw in Charles from year before and you have the “Twitch Quartet” (got us all\nthru covid with their gaming streams), all very talented in one generation!', ""I don't know that I'd rate him as the BEST driver on the grid this year, but he's in the top 5 IMO and has solidified his place on the grid for years to come.  I'm a huge fan so this year has been incredibly fun to watch him get the recognition he deserves.\n\nHis F2 season is insane when you account for the fact that he didn't know if he was going to be racing that week until sometimes like the day before the weekend would start. I think he's always been on the radars of F1 teams since karting as I remember a lot of drivers noting how they all knew he was super fast back then. The biggest limiter for him getting through the feeder series was money."", ""Albon has always been my favorite driver. He never gets enough recognition, yet consistently outperforms teammates, and puts the car in some impressive qualifying results and races. \n\nHe has been exceptional this year and it's like JUST now people are starting to recognize his talent. \n\nI don't know if it's a nationality thing or because he's just mostly been a midfield driver and noone pays attention to what the best of the rest are doing..."", ""Albon is as British as Norris, he just races under a Thai flag because it's beneficial, while Norris has a rich parent.\n\n\nBoth have one parent from the UK and one parent from overseas, both have dual nationality.\xa0"", 'I raced against Albon during covid in the sim leagues. He was the fastest out of Russel, Lando, Leclerc, Sainz, etc. In fact his brother Luca beat all of them and Albon was 2nd. They all raced together and when the F1 sessions were done they would play Euro Truck simulator. Until the truck regulars started complaining about the F1 guys in the server because the F1 guys would do dumb stuff like swerving insanely to “warm up the truck tires”']",2515,144,0.95,2515,6694,6694,56,0,0.0,56

Final race of the season.

Title was between three Ferraris', Fangio, Behra and Collins.

Fangio lead the Championship on 30 points, Collins and Behra tied on 22.

Complicating the matter, each driver only counted their best 5 results.

So Fangio could only increase his points tally if he won (giving an extra 2 points), as he didn't compete in the Indy 500 and already discarded a 4th place finish, his next worst result was a 2nd.

Behra could improve his total by finishing better than 3rd, giving him 2 or 4 points meaning he could not beat Fangio to the title.

Collins could improve his points if he finished the race as he already had discarded 2 DNFs, meaning a win would give him the 8 points that would win the title as Fnagio therefore couldn't win.

Fangio's steering broke, so they asked Collins to give his car up... and he did.

Collins gave up his only hope of winning the title so that Fangio would be guaranteed it, no threat from any other team or driver, a straight battle between the 2 of them.

# 1982 San Marino Grand Prix

Ferrari were having a pretty shocking start to the season but arrived at a hime race at Imola with a quick car.

They were running 1-2 with a decent gap as cars behind retired. Villeneuve ahead of Pironi.

Ferrari issued an order to both cars to slow down to protect the cars and the result.

Villeneuve believed this meant for the drivers also to hold station... Pironi did not.

Pironi passed on the last lap and Villeneuve vowed to never talk to him again in his life, he died 2 weeks later making that statement most likely true.

# 1989 San Marino Grand Prix

Second race of the season where McLaren were clearly the fastest car but hadn't won the first race.

Senna qualified on pole with Prost second.

Pre -race agreement between the drivers (not the team apparently), Whoever lead into turn 1 would stay there and be unchallenged for the race.

From the start Senna got away in the lead comfortably, but a major lap 4 crash bought out the red flags meaning a restart was required and the race would be run to aggregate time.

From the second start Prost got ahead comfortably, but into Tosa on Lap 1 senna overtook to lead the race.

Senna claimed the agreement only applied to the first start, Prost was furious.

# 1998 Australian Grand Prix

Season opener and McLaren were looking very quick and the car to beat, qualifying 1-2.

Pre race agreement was whoever lead into turn 1 would win the race to stop the drivers fighting it out.

Hakkinen lead into turn 1 and lead the race as planned.

However a phantom pit call from the team lead Hakkinen to make an extra unnecesary stop, handing the lead to Coulthard and an easy win.

He slowed down on the last lap letting Hakkinen take the victory. Hakkinen went on to become the team leader and win the championship that season.

# 1998 Belgian Grand Prix

Chaotic wet race, through retirements and decent pace the Jordan team find themselves in a 1-2 with Damon Hill ahead of Ralf Schumacher going for the team's first ever win.

Damon Hill (an experienced Grand Prix winner and World Champion) gets on the radio and suggests the team should protect the result and stop the team mates from fighting.

The Team agreed and ordered the drivers to hold station, denying Ralf Schumacher an opportunity at a maiden victory.

Ralf's brother Michael was furious with the decision and was very outspoken against it.

# 2002 Austrian Grand Prix

A dominant Ferrari team with a dominant Schumacher far ahead in the championship having won 4 of the first 5 races (and a third place) and coming off the back of 2 world titles in the previous 2 seasons.

Ferrari find themselves 1-2 with Barrichello ahead of Schumacher.

Ferrari order Barrichello to let Schumacher through for multiple laps approaching the end of the race, but Barrichello appears to be ignoring them and taking a second ever grand prix win.

Out of the last corner he dramatically slows allowing Schumacher to cross the line ahead, Schumacher clearly embarassed amid the boos on the podium ushers Barrichello to take the top step and collect the trophy (which earned the team a fine for breaking podium protocol).

# 2008 Singapore Grand Prix

Possibly the most infamous team orders controversy.

Renault and Alonso found themselves with an uncompetitive car with season best results of 4th place.

In Singapore Alonso qualified 15th and was expecting another tough race.

Alonso took an unusually early pit stop on lap 12 of the race.

The on lap 14 his team mate crashed heavily bringing out the safety car, which due to rules for that season where drivers couldn't pit, promoted Alonso to the front of the field (once penalties for pitting under Sc were sorted out) which he held for the rest of the race.

A year later Piquet claimed he was ordered by the team to crash in a way that gave them a chance at victory, team boss and engineering director were found guilty and given life time bans from F1 (which were later reduced).

# 2010 German Grand Prix

Coming into the race Alonso in Ferrari is a semi-distant 5th palce in the standings 47 points off the lead.

In the race Ferrari team mates Massa and Alonso found themselves at the front with Massa leading.

Through a couple of pit stop phases the gap yoyo'd with Alonso generally looking slightly quicker but unable to pass Massa who looked to have enough to win.

They had effectively seen off the threat of the cars behind and with Team orders being banned in F1 it loooked as though Massa would take a popular and deserved win.

On lap 48 of the race Massa received a message from his engineer Rob Smedley ""OK, so, Fernando is faster than you. Can you confirm you understood that message?"", on lap 49 Massa was 'mysteriously' slow off the exit of the hairpin losing the lead.

His engineer then apologised over the radio and Massa went on to finish 4 seconds behind his team mate.

# 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix

Second race of the season with the Red Bull cars looking quick but not having great success in the opening round of the season.

In a mixed condition race Webber ended up ahead of Vettel on a dry track, after spending much of the race in close quarters and things getting increasingly frought Red Bull issued the command ""Multi Map 21"" to both drivers which was a coded message for car 2 (Webber) to stay in front of car 1 (Vettel).

Ignoring this message and trying to avenge issues from a title deciding race at the end of the previous season Vettel launched risky attacks on his team mate which were rebuffed with equal venom and the multi corner fight by the team mates was intense, Vettel came out ahead.

Team Boss Christian Horner came on the radio saying ""This is silly, Seb. Come on."" on lap 46.

On lap 47 Webber tried to repass Vettel, but was forced wide and blocked from overtaking.

Vettel went on to win the race and faced fierce criticism from Webber in the media after the race but Vettel was unapologetic and supported by the team.","[""Good read! We can't talk team orders and not mention the 1982 French GP. Arnoux and Prost got a 1-2 but Arnoux (starting on pole) ignored a pre-race agreement that if he was running ahead of Prost, he'd let him pass to help Prost's championship challenge. I guess the appeal of winning his home race was too strong to resist. Arnoux also left Renault at the end of the season.\xa0\n\nAlso a fun fact about this race, it was a French 1-2-3-4 (Arnoux and Prost 1-2 for Renault followed by Pironi and Tambay 3-4 for Ferrari)\xa0"", '>Fangio\'s steering broke, so they asked Collins to give his car up... and he did.\n\n>Collins gave up his only hope of winning the title so that Fangio would be guaranteed it, no threat from any other team or driver, a straight battle between the 2 of them.\n\nThat\'s not exactly how it went.\n\nFerrari asked Musso to give Fangio his car, he disobeyed, Collins came in for a scheduled pit and when he saw Fangio standing there he gave up his car for the maestro, effectively handing over the championship to Fangio, because ""he was young and would have more opportunities"" (Collins died two years later during the German GP).\n\n\nSo there was a team order, but what happened was one of the most gentlemanlike acts in the history of Formula 1.\n\nFangio later said he was moved by the chivalry of his colleague.', 'Some interesting context about Austria 2002 and Ferrari team orders in general from Ross Brawn \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/UVrlK', ""I'll never forget how Schumacher made it as obvious as possible that Rubens won that and earned that win."", ""Something which I think always gets missed when discussing Austria 2002 is that Ferrari had team-ordered Rubens out of the way at the previous year's Austrian GP in order to allow Schumacher to take second. That one didn't go down brilliantly, but it was at least somewhat understood since Schumacher's main rival that year (Coulthard) won the race, and would have closed to just two points behind Schumacher if not for the swap. The fact it wasn't for the win also helped soften the blow somewhat.\n\nThe 2001 race was fresh in everyone's minds the following year though, so the fact Ferrari did it again in a season which they were utterly dominating was always going to cause anger.

Now that the dust has settled in Monza it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will not be deleted since I do not have that power, but I will be very disappointed with you.

At this point I feel like he's on a spiral similar to Antonelli where due to bad luck and a few mistakes, their confidence has completely eroded and they've started acting reckless and desperate.

A few of his best tracks are coming up and I hope we see him return to his usual level then.\n\nMy other bois Leclerc and Russell having quiet but excellent weekends which has become the usual for them. It feels like both teams have dropped off in performance which is a real shame because the drivers are both in very good form, Silverstone aside."", 'Seems like Sainz and Antonelli are just spiralling at this point.

Because he basically got full protection from a safety car (and took the opportunity of benefitting from a safety car away from Oscar) as well as protection from his teammate getting the pitstop priority. It really took away from their whole “free to race” sentiment, since it guaranteed the p2 to Lando and negated any opportunity that Oscar could’ve had.\n\nIt reminds me of the Miami sprint, where Oscar pit first and Lando ended up benefitting from a safety car popping up between Oscar’s pitstop and his, which ultimately gave Lando the win. Lando wanted to avoid this scenario yesterday, as is his right to choose since he was the lead car, and he argued exactly what he needed to ensure the best result for himself (good for him it was exactly what he needed), but McLaren should’ve never promised anything.\n\nBecause then they felt like it was on them to correct the mistake of the pitcrew, when a slow stop was just a different risk Lando exposed himself to in exchange to protecting himself from the risk of a safety car.

Going from P14 to P7 is just amazing and he's now ahead of Kimi in the WDC. The battle goes on till Abu Dhabi as he said and right now I'm backing Albon to finish ahead.\n\nHadjar is easily the rookie of the season. Pitlane to P10 is a brilliant effort. Really pleased for him given how it all went wrong in Melbourne. Is he going to get the Red Bull seat for next season? \n\nGabi has also really picked up his race performances. His qualifying performances are getting all the praise and for good reason. Hulk is no slouch on Saturday's and Gabi is beating him fair and square.

Now a consistent points finisher, I think he's really setting himself up nicely to lead Audi once Hulk retires."", 'I think Mclaren are thinking about this the wrong way. They can only provide equality of opportunity and not equality of outcome. They should have just asked Norris whether he wants to pit or not. They are rivals and the garages should act like it\n\nHe should not know what Oscar is going to do and vice versa. Will Joseph should just ask if Lando wants to pit. If he does, there is no undercut but he risks the chance of vsc or SC.  If he waits, he risks undercut but can benefit from vsc. He cannot just be given all options and be told what Oscar is going to do. \n\nThey should have just thought the pit stop as racing incident. There should not be a guarantee that whenever he pits he is ahead. Just doesnt make sense.\n\nSure give lando the first chance to take the call but he cannot be just given the advantage on a platter disadvantaging Oscar.', ""I will throw an early monkey wrench to the discussion. My apologies to the dudes who manage the place in advance\n\nFrom my understanding, the events took place as follows:\n\n• Norris has stated, when asked, that he is alright with Piastri stopping first, so as long as he does not end up behind him, essentially an undercut. It is affirmed that nothing of the sort will take place. It is also understood that McLaren's general rule is to let the leading driver pit first\n\n• Piastri proceeds to pit with 1.9 seconds without a hitch\n\n• Norris proceeds to pit. There was an issue with the front left tyre. The pit took 5.9 seconds and he ends up behind Piastri instead, which was not a part of what was agreed upon\n\n• McLaren proceeds to go on the radio and asks Piastri if they could swap back. Piastri was understandably confused, but he decides to honour the request\n\nNorris agreeing to the stop with conditions in the attempts of protecting his position while also ensuring the security of the team's 2-3 position in that manner is understandable. Even though I understand the strategy fully, but ultimately *(and this is admittedly under hindsight)*, McLaren should have stuck to the original agreement provided, or maybe provided risk assessments for the leading driver to take. Reasons being that you do not confuse and alienate the drivers later, and you are also preparing for any misfortunes from taking place, considering how risky it all is\n\nHowever, the gamble did not pay off and the blunder happened *(neither you, me nor a deity can change that)* and McLaren asks Piastri to make the swap, the same way that Norris was asked to make the swap in Hungary 2024. I am of the opinion that bad stops are a part and parcel of the race but not only does McLaren seem to have stipulated procedures about a potential situation like this, given their advantage in the WCC, but the drivers themselves displayed sportsmanship in regards to their team when the other alternative is just as present for the taking. They both acknowledged the team mistake and the difficulty of the other being stuck in this position. I think it is handily established prior that radio messages are not a great indicative of true sentiments, given the lack of full context to the drivers and I don't see why this should be different here.\n\nDo I think the call to swap is understandable? Yes. \n\nDo I think this was a highly unnecessary situation for McLaren to put their drivers into? Also yes. \n\nDo I think this is a warrant for some of the most ridiculous outcries and complaints I had ever seen from the likes of social media users who follow Formula 1? Absolutely not.\n\nTo me personally, the line between fighting for your points and regarding the team dynamics for a team that values themselves more makes the battle interesting. I am curious to see where it goes from here for them. But McLaren definitely needs to sort this out, especially when they want a fair championship fight"", 'Ollie did not deserve that penalty.

Oscar Piastri opened up after a challenging race at Monza, where McLaren opted to swap positions between teammates. While not thrilled, Piastri called the decision ""fair,"" acknowledging Lando Norris had been ahead all race. He reflected on handling struggles in the first stint and accepted that the car lacked the pace to challenge Red Bull. The young Aussie is focused on learning and improving from here.","['The amount of attention this swap is making really says either a lot about how fickle f1 fans are or how boring the race was', 'Going for the diplomatic approach, I see.\n\nIt is probably a smart move on his part. The numbers current favour him in the championship fight -- all he needs to do it win one or two more races and he can finish second to Norris in every other race and still be champion. It would not be worth incurring the ire of the team for the sake of a few extra points. I cannot say that I like it, but McLaren seem to have shot themselves in the foot and Piastri comes out of this looking mature and magnanimous while Norris gets booed on the podium. It might mean playing politics, but with any luck Piastri can parse this into some kind of additional support from the team since the team seem to be hypervigilant about how the public perceive them.', 'He said ""it\'s something we\'ll discuss"" twice in this interview.  That carries a lot of weight.\n\nAnybody that thinks Oscar was fine with this decision in the end, is kidding themselves', 'The reporter misrepresented the discussion - there was no reference made to protecting from Charles.

We’ll swap it around so stay out.\n\nLN: Well, only if he doesn’t undercut, otherwise I’ll box first.\n\nWJ: There will be no undercut. Confirming we are staying out\n\nLN: Yeah, confirm.', ""I see people saying this is the right approach but it is not and might hurt Piastri more in the long run. I will explain:\n\nA strategic choice was made to let Piastri pit first due to the chance of a possible SC(non-controllable). This is a clear advantage for Norris. The risk for Norris is that he might get undercut. He had a clear time advantage, so the choice was made with the idea he won't get undercut.\n\nThe pitstop was too long (non-controllable) and made Piastri undercut Norris. Not strategy or planning.\n\nSo this was the deal: the non-controllable circumstances are ONLY in favour of Norris and never in favour of Piastri. If Norris got the SC advantage it would be him in front of Piastri but never Piastri in front of Norris. Terrible deal isn't it?\n\nSo why does this hurt Piastri? \n- Getting played: his team is taking the Mick out of him with this bad deal.\n- The team gets away with it. Next time they will do the same and not feel the pressure of a mad Piastri.\n- Self worth: Piastri is a great driver worthy of the #1 driver in a team. Your devaluating your worth and be the guy that is taken advantage of. That is not the position you wanna be in and worth fighting for to not be in."", 'In the objective sense of the word yes it was fair, the question is if McLaren were obligated to be fair in this scenario; to which most people would answer no, but that’s what they seem to have chosen and this isn’t the first example. For better or worse this is consistently how they do things.\n\nThe biggest take away is that’s this is two races in a row that they’ve made race ruining bad stops, they just got lucky that they made them under the safety car last weekend otherwise they’d have been in deep doodoo then as well.

So I'm not fan of anyone, no biases, just pure interest in racing and what racing right now is in F1 and what it maybe should be ?  
  
Considering what we have seen lately with these penalties to now Bearman vs Sainz and last race Sainz vs Lawson.

I feel like as racing we are entering kind of weird area, I dont know the exact ruling, but whatever it is it needs change or adjustment ?

The thing is if we aren't allowing drivers to go into corners wheel to wheel, then overtakes are not going to happen as often, see in my opinion when Bearman had half of his car alongside Sainz, then Sainz should give that room to allow this fight to happen, same goes to Liam though it was more of like racing incident imo, but still Liam shouldve propably leave bit more space before closing.

Another thing I wanted to discuss is the turn 1 in Monza, like Norris and Verstappen are alongside one another and Norris kind of doesn't turn (turns late/has too much speed) and instead goes more forward which pushes VER out of the track as he just cannot turn otherwise they crash and its like so who is first at that apex ? If we go by centimeters we might find the answer but is that racing ?   
  
The thing I heard on broadcast is Lando is on the racing line and he is entitled to it but is he ? Was he on racing line ? He barely made the turn imo, he was carrying too much speed and it shows on the line he had to take in that case. Going over the curb having only his right wheels slightly over the track limits line. Thats not racing line is it or rather not the optimal racing line (its shit line that would lose time every lap) but then it begs the question whats stops you from turning late in every turn and leaving the car on the outside not able to turn, with this current scenario it seems you can do that everytime and imo it just promotes unhealthy racing. Like everytime it seems  you want to be on the inside, slightly ahead and then just turn late so the car on outside cannot do shit and has to either crash you or leave track and thus overtake outside of track.

What's your thoughts on these scenarios, what would be the ideal way to ""fix"" or let me know why you think its good the way it is now. Whatever feels right to you.   
  
Just bring no biases into this discussion pretty please, let's keep it healthy for F1 and racing in general so we can all enjoy the best of both worlds.","['So the important context to remember is that the guidelines as they currently exist were agreed upon by, and developed with, the drivers. This is the ruleset they wanted. \n\nAs a fan, though, I agree that it\'s...not great as is. Another good example from this weekend was an incident in the F2 sprint. Dunne pulled a massive move, came from very far back into T1 on the inside and got to the apex first, and essentially ran Megatounif out of track. Meg then had a lot of momentum, came across and hit Dunne on the outside of T2. Meg was penalized for rejoining unsafely and causing a collision, but the scenario in general was caused by Dunne a) playing the rules well and b) somehow controlling a wild divebomb.\n\n But there was also generally nothing Meg could have done to avoid contact - it was a low probability move from Dunne, but should Meg have braked earlier as the first into the corner, to just let Dunne by? That\'s the only way that I can see that contact could have been avoided by the defending driver. \n\nIn general, I think we all want to see hard, controlled wheel-wheel racing. We want overtakes to be encouraged, but still difficult to do. If the car ahead at the apex can run the other car off of the track at will, it doesn\'t make for great overtakes. \n\nIt may not help, or it may cause other, larger issues that I\'m not thinking of, but I\'d be curious how changing the definition of ""alongside"" to represent the literal position of the car would impact racing. Essentially, say, if the front tyre is beside the rear, then the lead car has to provide at least a half car length or a tyre\'s width of room on track - something, to give the trailing driver a chance to not crash or run off track, while still likely losing out on the position.', ""The drivers asked for this level of detail in the guidelines and it's been dreadful.\n\nAs Mark Hughes at The Race suggested recently, the best thing for them to do would be to scrap 80% of the guidelines, because they can never cover for 100% of racing scerarios."", 'And that\'s why we have the term ""racing incident"", because there are many times were both drivers can be in the right and yet something still happens. I don\'t know how to make it better, but the only suggestion so far that seems to be the best is the idea of having a fixed team of stewards instead of having them switched up every race. Some more consistency is needed, but other than that, racing will always be a very tricky thing to monitor and penalize correctly all the time.', ""Lap 1 should be on Norris for pushing a car off the track, but ultimately the stewards didn't make a call on it.\n\nNorris was behind going into the corner, he was behind in the corner and he was behind coming out of the corner so at no point was he entitled to that corner.\n\nBut the fact that RBR felt the need to give up the place regardless speaks volumes about how rules are either to vague and open to interpretation, or the lack of trust in the stewards making the right call."", 'Good job on catching that Norris was a bit wide on T1, so Max went wide to give more space which led to the runoff, then he had to give it back.\n\n\nMost new viewers (and old viewers) have not noted that nuance, usually just hurr durr max agression, etc.', 'It’s too complicated and the drivers are at fault for this because they keep saying this is how we did it since karting. So it’s a fundamental problem with racecraft starting at the very beginning of the ladder. In the old days the fear of being killed if you didn’t leave some space for someone or reacted to their move kept things in check. Now that is no longer a deterrent. It has to start in karting and it’s two simple rules. Always leave the width of one car length beside you and do not react to a move being made.', 'Online sim racing has it pretty simple. As Alonso said, all the time you have to leave the space. Works well. Been asking for years why it can‘t also work like this IRL.\n\nIn cases like Lando T1, if you don‘t leave the space and therefore force the other car off track, there is no issue with cutting the chicane since you were basically forced to cut it.', 'The main issue I think everyone agrees on is that the ""First at Apex"" rule they are currently following is bad.\n\nFormula 1 has the big downside of cars being very fragile. This has improved with the 2022 regulations, but contact still means parts break off, leading to loss of downforce and therefore pace.\n\nThis fragility means that I personally feel overtakes more often than not turn into ""either you move out of the way, or we crash"" moves.  \nThis is only increased by the ""First at Apex"" Guideline for Stewards. It rewards reaching the apex first by any means necessary. It doesn\'t matter if you push the outside car on the grass, it\'s legally your corner now.\n\nWe don\'t need NASCAR levels of overlap to be allowed space, but front axle ahead of the rear axle would be a start for both defender and attacker', ""To explain a litte the guide lines, in a very summed up way.\n\nOvertake on the inside: This one is fairly simple, if, before the apex, your front axle is side by side with the other car's rear view mirror, its your corner and the other guy cant close you or deny you space or anything. Yes, that does mean you can do an overtake while being slightly behind a car as you both turn. Naturally, you need to complete the corner, you cant just send the car and not manage to turn, and the racing line has to be compatible with an overtake.\n\nOverake on the outside, and this is the universal headache for all the drivers: Your front axle, AT THE APEX, needs to be side by side with the other driver's or even further ahead, and then its your corner and the other guy has to give it to you unless they exit the corner better. Problem is, how do you defend from an overtake on the outside? The way you usually defend from that as it happens, is ease up on the brake to be ahead at the apex, and thats where the problem starts for a lot of drivers, cause it becomes a fight for the apex and not the position. But one thing that is agreed by the drivers, even though they may not like it when they are the ones on the scope, if they lift their foot from the break to defend and it causes a collision, that is their fault because its interpreted as them losing control of their car"", 'The racing guidelines are stupid because every situation is unique. The only rule that makes sense to apply in every scenario is: ""if another car is beside you, both drivers need to leave space."" Then we just need to define what ""beside"" means, like is it 1 inch of overlap, front wheel to rear wheel, front wheel to mirror etc.\n\nAll the crap in the guidelines about ahead or significantly alongside at the apex when overtaking/defending on the inside/outside is silly. They tried to make rules that can be applied in every scenario but then when you actually apply them consistently you get stuff like Sainz\'s ridiculous penalty at Zandvoort.\n\nIf we\'re being completely real, defining who gets a penalty is much more like defining porn. I don\'t know how to define it, but you know it when you see it.']",2,30,0.53,2,85,85,-2,0,-0.020000000000000018,-2

Lando and Oscar did the right thing by the team. Which consists of hundreds of people at the fatcory not just themselves. Including the poor wheel gunner who either had bad equipment or a bad day at the office, we don't know.
