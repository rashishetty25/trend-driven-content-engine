Now Ralf Schumacher told Sky Deutschland that Doohan might be replaced by Colapinto as soon as the next race. If that’s the case and Alpine retained Colapinto next year, by then he would be a “rookie” with a whopping 30-race experience. Many drivers have shorter career than that. Conversely, if Doohan managed to find a seat next year, he would not be considered “rookie” despite having just 4-race experience simply because one of those races are the first race.

Is there an official definition of “rookie” driver?

1ju7eux,[AMuS] Antonelli made a strong Suzuka debut,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ju7eux/amus_antonelli_made_a_strong_suzuka_debut/,2025-04-08, News,,"['If Antonelli does turn out to be superstar as he is currently appearing to do so will Ferrari try to poach him at some point?', 'Translation and full article:\n\n\n> Andrea Kimi Antonelli is a fast learner. The Formula 1 rookie once again impressed in Japan. The Italian is getting closer and closer to George Russell, but also knows where he still needs to improve.\n\n> The hype was huge when Mercedes announced at the Italian Grand Prix in late summer 2024 that Andrea Kimi Antonelli would succeed superstar Lewis Hamilton. A few days earlier, the Italian had just turned 18. His crash during free practice at Monza involuntarily drew attention. The question arose: Does the rookie have what it takes to succeed in Formula 1?\n\n> Three races have now been completed in the still-young 2025 season. And Antonelli has already silenced the critics. The Mercedes rookie finished all three Grands Prix in the points. After fourth place in Melbourne and eighth in Shanghai, Antonelli crossed the finish line in sixth place in Suzuka (April 6th). That\'s 28 points. In addition, there are the two points from the China sprint, when the teenager finished seventh.\n\n> Antonelli has settled into fifth place in the drivers\' standings. Thanks to his more than solid results in the first few races, Mercedes is second in the constructors\' standings. The factory team is already 36 points behind leader McLaren, but Red Bull and Ferrari are easily keeping the Silver Arrows at bay.\n\n> **Leading laps in Suzuka.**\nThe weekend in Japan didn\'t start particularly well for Antonelli. While teammate George Russell was long considered the only driver who could potentially challenge the McLaren, Antonelli struggled with the conditions. The Bologna-born teenager still had to learn the challenging rollercoaster. He also struggled with tire management to perfectly warm up the sensitive Pirelli tires for a fast lap.\n\n> After reserve driver Valtteri Bottas gave the rookie a few tips, things suddenly flowed smoothly: sixth place in qualifying, just one position and two-tenths of a second behind Russell. Things went even better for Antonelli in the race. While his opponents stopped earlier than him, he was able to record the first lead laps of his Formula 1 career. ""When I had clear air, the pace really improved and I was able to extend my stint on the medium tires. That was a good feeling.""\n\n> Antonelli was able to take advantage of the fresh tires towards the end of the race, setting two records. The youngster needed just 1:30.965 minutes for his 50th lap – no one in the race was able to beat that. Never before has a younger driver recorded a fastest lap and led a Grand Prix. World champion Max Verstappen was 6,803 days old in Barcelona in 2016. Antonelli was three days younger on race day in Japan when he achieved the feat.\nAntonelli is aware of his record: ""It was a nice feeling to lead the race for a few laps and to be the youngest driver in Formula 1 history to do so.""\n\n> **Russell as a benchmark.**\nThe development direction of the driver, described as a super talent, is in the right direction. But when will Antonelli first be on par with George Russell? He appears calm. ""I hope it will happen as soon as possible. But we also have to look at how strong George\'s start to the season has been. He already showed how good he is last year.""\n\n> According to Antonelli, part of the gap is also due to a lack of maturity: ""George always gets the most out of the car. I think that has to do with experience."" However, the challenger remains firmly convinced he can beat Russell at some point: ""The potential is there.""\n\n> **Student Antonelli.**\nSomeone who could give him tips on how to realize his potential at the pinnacle of motorsport is Valentino Rossi. Before the Japanese Grand Prix, Antonelli met up with his compatriot for a go-kart session. The nine-time motorcycle world champion shared some stories from his career. ""He told me a lot about his time. Now I want to go to MotoGP myself,"" the rookie beamed.\n\n> Before that, however, there are still Formula 1 races on the schedule. Antonelli also has to go to school for a few weeks. The final exam period is approaching. According to Mercedes, math is his particular problem area. He could ask his numerous engineers for some tutoring. The rookie is a great learner. He\'s already proven that in his short time as an F1 driver.', 'When I read ""school"", I thought he was finishing up university - then I remembered he\'s just 18!\n\nI am really, really curious what it\'s like attending high/secondary school while being an F1 driver. I imagine it must seem faintly ridiculous to have to think about final exams at all, given his job...', 'Calling it now Bearman vs Antonelli will be the next great rivalry in the 2030s.', 'After watching 3 race I starting to like him. Let how the season end.', ""This kid is unreal at the moment, he is performing to the cars level and is keeping pace with George. So far I'm very impressed.\xa0"", 'I thought the kid was overhyped as hell and that it was a mistake to directly put him into the Mercedes but Toto might have done a fantastic call with him.', 'Rookie just showed the potential of that Mercedes.

Australia first, then China, and finally Japan highlighted the problems with which this SF-25 was born. “We can\'t turn as high as we would like,” Lewis Hamilton\'s no-nonsense confirmation in the Suzuka post-qualifying session was the final judgment regarding the limitations that are crippling Ferrari\'s real potential. In the first three outings, the car remained virtually the same at the level of the aerodynamic map but, despite this, the car offered some dynamics that are still unclear to Vasseur\'s men, ""We have to solve the balancing problems that are affecting us. If we make the most of the car, I think there is still potential to be extracted.""\n\nThe problems of a rear end that was too soft structurally already surfaced at the tests, Leclerc had already talked about it with some people very close to him. The issues came out in the open for good in Melbourne. Then in China, Ferrari decided to take a risk with the set-up, at the price of a disqualification for Lewis Hamilton\'s skid wear. Suzuka was the GP of awareness: the SF-25 “limited” by heights - there is talk of about 3 mm of extra height - expressed fourth-force potential overall. An overly negative result, which sentences that the redhead has on average lost 3-4 tenths to McLaren in a single winter. Running with set-ups that “cripple” the SF-25 by about 20 load points makes a major contribution to the technical lag that is being blamed on the current benchmark dictated by the MCL39. While waiting for the work in Maranello to bear fruit with the arrival of specific correctives, it emerges in blatant manners that the car has problems that are not so immediate to solve.\n\nUrgent technical reaction: here\'s how Ferrari changes in Bahrain. Will the new parts limit the evils of the SF-25?\n\nThe first evolutionary step to be put in place on the red car, placed under the decision-making guidance of Loic Serra, comes on the Sakhir track, a track of which there are many references thanks to the pre-season testing at the end of February. The technical run-up to McLaren does not look like an impossible task, but still not as fast as one might think (or hope). The arrival of new parts at race number four is, in itself, the concentration of expected components spread over the stages just ahead. It was never in Ferrari\'s plan to bring new parts to Suzuka, either for logistical reasons or because of choices the team wanted to make, despite the fact that in any case the team on the eve of the race knew it had to run on the defensive. For Bahrain, the SF-25 will be fitted, as anticipated, with an initial overhaul of the bottom as a whole.  \nThe areas of intervention were the neuralgic ones, of which it is always delicate to go to get hands on as they go to “mess up” some variables on the behavior of the car. However, given the state of affairs, the car needed a reshuffling of the load so that the changes can make the car more “predictable.” Novelties on a global level implemented touching venturi channels and extractor, updated in their overall. A real macro-upgrade intended purely for performance and peak load stability, studied in the tunnel in winter and deliberated at the beginning of the season. It is clear that the SF-25\'s balance problems, given by a rear end that always struggles to follow a front end-which, by design choice, is very pointed-may not be fully resolved in Bahrain. With these F1s we have often seen how an aerodynamic package can offer less than the factory data but there have been instances where a package has also overperformed than expected. There is confidence, however, that the platform of the SF-25 should in part benefit from the new parts in order to achieve greater balance and allow more consistent load to be expressed. Cautious optimism leaks out from Maranello on this aspect.\n\n\\[1/2\\]', 'Next year is our year', 'If these dont do much or even worse, backfire, I’d say Ferrari won’t win the championship.', 'Ferrari deserves the win again once they make it look like less of a HP website banner. Beauty and style made it faster!', 'Bahrain will throw more questions than answers ! It just Ferrari way ...', 'I don’t think they can resolve the rear issue this year cuz of gear box and suspension. Those parts can not be resolved simply by aero if it is designed. However, I do hope it can improve its overall performance.', ""Not only a revised bottom in Bahrain, Ferrari's novelties are concentrated at the rear end, and it is no coincidence.\n\nThe ‘shopping list’ for that of Sakhir should see an SF-25 have (also) ‘side’ changes compared to what will be the macro-upgrade to the bottom. A package then quite ‘complete’ to focus a first step in view of further technical improvements already in the works. The weekend's plan of action is being decided, where it would seem fair to expect Lewis Hamilton to try out the new parts on the SF-25 right away, while rookie Dino Beganovic, who will replace Leclerc in FP1, is expected to run his runs with the SF-25 fitted with the old bottom, for direct comparison. Other changes will all focus on the rear area, with changes to the rear wing monopilot and a new brake intake. \n\nThe second evolutionary step, perhaps the most important one, has not yet been deliberated, and this suggests...\n\nLoic Serra will decide after Bahrain how to act on it, with an approach that could see more spread-out and “steady” updates than more aggressive decisions in the past, as had been the case under Enrico Cardile. A larger package being worked on by Tondi's aerodynamic department is not yet officially decided when it might debut. The current situation inside the walls of the Italian team sees other macro changes being deliberated that rule out, at the moment, an introduction in Miami in favor of the later stages in May.  The French technical director at the moment is splitting work on SF-25 developments with the 2026 project, but information tells us clearly that SF-25 development remains a priority until at least next month, which will be substantially decisive in continuing to give resources to the development of the current car. Restoring the fortunes of the 2025 thus remains, as of today, still the priority for effects that we will see on the track in the coming weeks.\n\n\\[2/2\\]"", 'I’d say Ferrari won’t win the championship anyway, but I hope they solve their issues to at least have some competition at the front.', 'They were so close to WCC despite going backwards with spain update and wasting 2 months correcting it\n\nFerrari in-season development now looks promising unlike in the past where they either stood still or went back']",31,17,0.93,31,16,16,31,17,0.93,31

1juajwt,Do you think Suzuka would benefit from running the track in reverse?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1juajwt/do_you_think_suzuka_would_benefit_from_running/,2025-04-08, Discussion,I tried it out in a sim and honestly I think it's far superior as far as passing opportunities. The straight ending in a chicane being the most obvious but also the longer straighter run into Spoon would be another possible overtaking place and even the hairpin could have a few  passes. There's also the added benefit of the esses being faster and more thrilling downhill. What do you think? I didn't see any immediate safety concerns. ,"[""Changing the direction is not just getting the cars to go the other way. The barrier openings become a problem, so do run-off areas (for example at Dunlop corner). Also, the new T1, the old final corner would be a very fast left hander, how would they keep DRS open for that. Even the pit exit would spit cars out right on the racing line. Plus all the technical stuff of start lights, grid boxes, recalibrating timing sensors, etc. \n\nThe simplest solution to make Suzuka more exciting is to add a new DRS zone from Spoon to 130R. If the drivers can manage turning DRS off before T1, they can do the same for 130R. It's a long straight which is being wasted by not having DRS there."", '""I didn\'t see any immediate safety concerns"" ????????????????', 'Guys, it was one boring race, calm down.
