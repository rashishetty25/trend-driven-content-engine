During the early 2010s, F1 introduced a lot of new circuits (like Korea, India, Turkey, etc.), many of which were later dropped.

On the current calendar, the only circuit left for Max to win at is Singapore (and Madrid if Red Bull builds a strong enough car).

The combination of career longevity, era transitions, and addition and deletion of tracks that helped Hamilton reach 31 is hard to replicate in today’s more stable F1 calendar.

While it is a wild speculation, Red Bull is known for making unexpected moves. Should Lindblad and Dunne make extraordinary progress in F2, they could swiftly replace Tsunoda and Lawson. It would be a huge gamble, but that is precisely the kind of decision Marko makes. The current situation in the F1 driver market indicates Red Bull is eager to secure their top future talent quickly, even if it means ruthlessly discarding experienced drivers. Such a radical move would instantly elevate the stakes in the junior categories, placing immense pressure on both Lindblad and Dunne to perform immediately. Furthermore, their lack of F1 experience could destabilize the junior team, but the hunger for a future champion often overrides short-term risk assessments in Milton Keynes.","[""I doubt Dunne will be in F1 in 2026 tbh. I think he stays in F2 and goes for the title next year with a view to take one of the Vcarb seats in 2027.\n\nAlso I'm not fully sure about his super license situation as there are some conflicting reports, but there is a chance Vcarb can't put him in next year even if they wanted to"", 'I believe Dunne has been linked to a second season in F2 with backing from Red Bull.

In the beginning of the season I was certain he would drive for vcarb in 2026, but now, he doesn't look ready. Sure, that never stopped Red Bull before, but I think they're more cautious now.

They are left with Stenshorne in f2 probably for one more year and Dries van Langedonck as their true hope for the future', ""Certainly possible. Tsunoda is very likely gone, while Mekies seems to support him more and there is more of an acceptance that the Red Bull is just really hard to drive, his results still haven't been great, and with Honda leaving there's less incentive to keep him. Hadjar will likely get promoted and it feels a bit pointless to keep Tsunoda around.\n\nLawson maybe gets a bit more grace if they felt they rushed him into RB too quickly, but similarly it may feel a bit like he's had his chance. He has been solid in the latter half of the season though, likely they'd prefer to have one more experienced driver to compare a rookie too, so I feel like he'll stay another year.\n\nI feel like the lineup will be Verstappen and Hadjar in Red Bull, Lawson and Lindblad in VCARB. Then if Lindblad gets up to speed well enough, Dunne will replace Lawson in 2027, after another year in F2.
