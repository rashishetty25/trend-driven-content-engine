Never too late to change your mindset for the better.', '>***When you get in the Ferrari, it’s love****. You make a different connection.*\n\nSomebody punch me. We really lost him to the mothership of red flags.', ""Some excerpts that I thought were of note from the interview:\n\n\n**Ferrari Magazine: How did it feel, that first moment you sat in the Ferrari SF-25?**\n\n\n>**Lewis Hamilton:** *Well, I’m in a different place in my life. I’m 40 now and I was 21 the first time I sat in an F1 car. To come from where I’ve come from, from watching F1 on TV, aspiring to race at the top level, to getting into an F1 car with the people around you, the mechanics and all the machinery… And then to be dropping myself into a red car 20 years later, **it was a lot more emotional**. **When I was 21 it wasn’t an emotional thing, it was ‘exciting’**, because everything was firing inside me. **When you get in the Ferrari, it’s love**. You make a different connection.*\n\n\n**FM: Surely anyone who knows anything about how Formula One works knows that it takes time…**\n\n>**LH:** *…And that’s not many people. Only when you’re inside a team can you really, truly understand how it works and how F1 works. You can’t imagine how the machine really operates otherwise. I’ve been in F1 for so long, but when I came to this team it really was different again. (There is a pause). So I don’t blame people for not knowing. **All I can do is continue to focus on the things that I can control. How I prepare, and work with the team. How I show up each day and stay positive.***\n\n\n**FM: This year sees the 50th anniversary of Niki Lauda’s first championship victory with Ferrari.\nYou became close to him. What influence did he have on you?**\n\n>**LH:** ***When I got to F1, Niki was part of a world that couldn’t adapt to me being different, and I heard negative things, though I’d always had an admiration for him as a three-time world champion. He’s one of the true icons of our sport. Then he’s on the phone telling me why I should come to the team [Mercedes], and then when we finally met we had a really good conversation. He said, “You’re just like me, you’re a racer to the core.” It wasn’t until we had that meeting that those barriers came down, that the stereotyped view he may have had was dealt with. After that we would travel to races together and he’d fly us places all the time.***\n\n\n**FM: Did you educate him?**\n\n>**LH:** ***I think we educated each other. He had the best stories, and we used to laugh so much together. And he was a fighter, literally until his last breath. It was unbelievable for me to see how hard he fought. We’d send video messages to each other, and right to the end he was fighting, saying “I’m coming back…” I loved him for that.***\n\n\n**FM: What do you say to those who suggest that this extra-curricular stuff is a distraction? (referring to his off track passions like music and fashion)**\n\n>**LH:** *It’s not a question of distraction. Everyone can get distracted, one way or another. It’s about how you decide to deploy your energy and create a sense of balance. **You’ve got to have a creative balance, you can’t just work every hour of your life because you’ll be miserable. How do you find things that inspire you and keep you uplifted? Tapping into your creativity is one way.***\n\n\n**FM: Your Mission 44 Foundation is continuing to promote diversity and improve education and opportunities in schools. Are you happy with the progress that’s being made?**\n\n>**LH:** *The work never stops. (He pauses). I was fortunate to meet Nelson Mandela. He was pushing and fighting for others until his last day. **Lead with intention. Don’t lower yourself to some of the levels that some people like to stoop to. Like Michelle Obama said, “They go low, we go high”.** Every meeting I have with a potential partner, I ask what they’re doing about impact. It will be a challenge as long as I live and there will be other fights along the way, too.*\n\n\n**FM: Do you have a full slate of upcoming projects? (About his film production company, Dawn Apollo)**\n\n>**LH:** *We have some ideas. I’m in the process of figuring it out but storytelling is something I’m really passionate about. **More than ever, we need inspirational stories out there, given the dark times we live in. I love comedy and I’ve got a particular idea for a television show. I’m working on a couple of animation movie ideas**, and we’re getting sent so much stuff since the F1 movie happened it’s crazy. **But it’s not about doing lots and lots of projects, it’s more like Quentin Tarantino does it, quality rather than quantity.***\n\n^(Please note that I've only included questions and answers that I personally thought were of importance.
