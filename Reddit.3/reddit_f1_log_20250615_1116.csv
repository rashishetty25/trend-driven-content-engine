1lbmhct,What can be a potential update to the rulebook on impedings?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lbmhct/what_can_be_a_potential_update_to_the_rulebook_on/,2025-06-14, Discussion,"We saw Sainz brutally lose his chance at Q2 by just 0.02s after being impeded by Hadjar during Q1. Hadjar ultimately ended up with a 3-place grid penalty, but still ended up at P12, ahead of Carlos at P16. Happens often, just the most recent of the lot.

I definitely don’t think evaluation post-race is worth much, and leaves the impeded driver with the short end of the stick nevertheless.

Maybe they should evaluate the time lost in the impeding between sessions (the AWS graphics for time lost shows they can do it). If that would have let the driver make it into the next session, they should be given another chance. So 16 drivers would race in Q2 instead of 15, or 11 in Q3

Probably has a bunch of issues related to this, but curious to hear your thoughts or alternatives to solving this issue!","['It sucks for Sainz. But it is what it is. \n\nYou can’t start revising drivers times because of what might have done if they weren’t impeded. For all we know Sainz would’ve slammed it into the WOC if he was on an actual lap. \n\nIntroducing anything like you suggest just introduces even more subjectivity to argue over\n\nI think it’s one of those things where what goes around comes around.\n\nThe one thing I did monetarily think of is demote the impeder to the place below the impedee, but again quickly ruled this out, bc it doesn’t make sense for Driver A to get a potential 1 place grid drop for impeding Driver B, whilst Driver C gets a potential 15 place grid drop for impeding Driver D, when guilty of the same offence. \n\nI don’t see how it could be fairly improved', 'The system is as good as it gets. We’ve seen so many times where Williams will put Albon out on track during the low traffic times as part of their strategy. Running during traffic when there’s more rubber and a faster track is a gamble and one they took along with pretty much every other driver. Didn’t pay off this time.', 'A key component is that you punish the offender.\xa0\n\n\nYou cannot raise the offendee by ""gifting"" them positions or time.\n\n\nYou cannot say (with any certainty) ""oh Sainz would have been 0.3 faster if he wasn\'t impeded so that makes it so he was P11"".\n\n\nYou just can\'t.\xa0\n\n\nIn soccer if someone professional fouls you don\'t go ""well he was gonna kick a goal so we\'ll just award a goal"".

You can\'t gift him 0.3 cause maybe if he wasn\'t impeded he would have messed up the lap later.\n\n\nToo many butterflies causing effects.\n\n\nIf we are going to change I\'d like to make the punishment more immediate and within that session. You impede ok, grid position for that session. If that puts you out you\'re out.\n\n\nBut that\'s a qualy penalty not a race penalty.\xa0', 'I’m more on the “let it be” side of things.

I\'m probably biased as a Williams fan but it really annoyed me that a direct rival like RB could just ""oops, didn\'t see him coming"" their way into a somewhat minor grid drop while Sainz\'s qualifying was completely ruined. IMO I\'d be interested to see a deleted lap time as a punishment for impeding, like what they\'re trialing in F2 as the punishment for causing a red flag, since it could unfairly end up benefitting the driver who makes the mistake at the expense of other drivers who did nothing wrong.', ""The point of penalties isn't to make any possible result of an infringing action fair and equitable, it's to make it worth allocating resources and effort to ensure the infringing action doesn't happen, as much as possible.\n\nTeams don't want to impede, so it's already doing its job, simple as."", ""The best answer for this situation is don't put yourself in a situation where you need a heroic last lap to get out of q1"", 'Current system encourages making a strong effort early (a good banker lap) but that didn’t account for aggressive track development or change in track condition.']",18,51,0.58,18,48,48,0,8,0.0,0
