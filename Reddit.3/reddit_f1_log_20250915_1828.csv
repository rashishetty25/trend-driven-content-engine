Chose a life in circuses
Jumped into the deepest end
Pushing himself to all extremes
Made it, people became his friend
Now they stood and noticed him
Wanted to be a part of it
Pulled out some poor machinery
So he worked till the pieces fit

[Pre-Chorus]
The people were intrigued
His wife held back her fears
The headlines gave acclaim
He'd realized their dreams

[Chorus]
Faster than a bullet from a gun
He is faster than everyone
Quicker than the blinking of an eye
Like a flash you could miss him going by
No one knows quite how he does it but it's true they say
He's the master of going faster

[Verse 2]
Now he moved into the space
That the special people share
Right on the edge of do or die
Where there is nothing left to spare
Still the crowds came pouring in
Some had hoped to see him fail
Filling their hearts with jealousies
Crazy people with love so frail

[Pre-Chorus]
The people were intrigued
His wife held back her fears
The headlines gave acclaim
He'd realized their dreams

[Chorus]
Faster than a bullet from a gun
He is faster than everyone
Quicker than the blinking of an eye
Like a flash you could miss him going by

&#x200B;

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

&#x200B;

GOOD LUCK AND MAY THE TRASH TALK BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOUR.

Obviously, the prop car isn‚Äôt going to compete with real F1 cars‚Äîthe R&D is nowhere near the level of even the worst F1 car, the engine isn‚Äôt as powerful, etc. But how do you think it would compare to an F2 car? Like, I read that the bodywork was primarily carbon fibre, and the fact that they were trying to build bodywork to look like an F1 car and at least somewhat fit with FIA F1 aero regulations makes me wonder if maybe it had superior aerodynamics to the average F2 car? And that combined with having the same engine makes me wonder if it would perform above the level of an F2 car, at least around the corners.","['They fitted plenty of cameras in it, that is the reason they choose F2 cars over F1 cars.\n\nSo probably, AXGP cars will much slower than regular F2 cars', 'It would be slower. While the aero they added was ""real"" (i.e. it generated useful amounts of downforce), it was not remotely optimized to reduce drag. So the net result is a car that is heavier and draggier than an F2 car, but using an F2 engine.\n\nSam Collins did an interesting interview with the vehicle coordinator for the movie talking about how they built the cars (including the electric version they used for the pit lane shots).\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Tv\\_W8ZLndM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Tv_W8ZLndM)', ""I reckon it'll be slower.

I would be shocked if the APX car had properly executed ground effect like current gen F2 cars, and the overbody aero is much less thought through than the 2018 gen F2s\n\nand even if the APX did have more downforce than current F2s, there's no telling how well it handles aero in corners, dirty air or cross winds, or if it has too much drag for what that engine can pull"", 'If you‚Äôre ever near an Apple Store, go do the Vision Pro demo where they have a ride along with Brad Pitt driving the car.
