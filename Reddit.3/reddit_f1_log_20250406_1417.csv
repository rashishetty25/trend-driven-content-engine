It was hilarious. Its like Jacques is trying to actively not tweak in his seat listening to Crofty's takes.

Although Villeneueve seems like he's a little stuck in the days he used to race in F1, I find his takes very insightful race craft wise (wdc afterall...), more than Crofty at least. And his opinion refreshing. I may not agree with him on some but it's refreshing to see a clash of opinions.

One instance during the last few laps: Crofty was like ""what are mclaren doing, let piastry pass lando to challenge max so we can finally have some racing"" and Villeneueve was like ""yeahh.... no he shouldn't, I wouldn't have lol. Every point counts individually, its champion mentality""

Max would need to pick up the pace to defend both Norris from behind and the overcut from Piastri, significantly damaging his tyres during the earlier rounds of his 2nd stint.

Scenario 1: With the pace that Oscar had, he might have won the overcut over both frontrunners - resulting in more points for McLaren.

Scenarion 2: Piastri drops back behind both frontrunners after his pit. With the better tire management on the McLaren cars Norris would have been able to attack Verstappen in the later stages.

Tires are too good now.

I get the argument against artificially improving races but we already do that by mandating stops.

But tires are too good now. Hards and mediums last forever. No one really uses softs anymore and when they do they don't really create enough delta.

Basically hards and mediums are fast and durable enough that they can last a long time within the limited push time available to the drivers (limited by fuel rate and load).

Unless weather or surface plays chaos, most races will suffer.","['Pirelli continues to have the hardest job in the paddock', 'I think the hards are too good, basically no pace deficit compared to mediums and last ages.\n\nI‚Äôd say just bring softer compounds to a circuit but the other issue is the softs are too bad.\nTire management is an interesting factor in the race but i‚Äôd love for drivers to be able to push to the max for each lap in qualifying.

They didn't, so now they can't be crying foul on a move that was made legally, even if it doesn't help them. And Redbull aren't the only team in F1 that have little side deals / rub my back, ill rub yours type of relationships behind the scenes.

If you give them two options quick and stable car or an unstable car with potentially slightly more speed - they‚Äôll pick the unstable one. Because speed is everything. If the car is easy to drive, it‚Äôs just a bonus, but not nr 1 priority for those who only count wins.', 'It‚Äôs been clear since pre-season testing that the McLaren is a handful when the drivers are pushing flat out on a qualifying lap. They‚Äôve both been saying that the rear end frequently steps out.l and that‚Äôs been clear to see. Stella has also confirmed that the car characteristics are causing an issue for both drivers but especially  Norris who is having to adapt to the fact that the characteristics (and in particular the way they have to set the car up to extract the performance) clash directly with the way he naturally extracts speed from a car. For some reason people are just absolutely refusing to hear what is being said by both the drivers and Stella and are acting like it‚Äôs a rocket ship on permanent rails, a second ahead of the field. \n\nThe only top car that seems particularly stable over one lap is the Merc, which has also been clear since pre-season testing. It‚Äôs not quite as fast as the McLaren, and very likely not the Red Bull and Ferrari either if those teams manage to hook things up fully, but that stability is allowing Russell in particular to extract the limit of performance on a more consistent basis (though even he had issues with the tyre prep in Q3 today)', 'More mistakes then typically characteristic for them?
