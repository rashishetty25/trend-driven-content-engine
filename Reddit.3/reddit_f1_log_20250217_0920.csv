There always seems to be a 3rd hand account of him wanting to come back, but the dude himself has basically given no indication personally, and he was pretty done with it when he retired.

Aston Martin did not want to extend his contract and others did not want to give him a new one.\n\nNow this is interesting. At the time I believe all the reports were that Vettel was weighing up retirement after giving the 22 regs a shot, Aston gave him an offer, but he chose to go, and Alonso pounced once he made that choice.\n\nIf this is what Vettel is supposedly saying in private settings I’d be interested in how that went down.\n\nAlso interesting that Seidl is the one who supposedly said no. I can see Binotto doing it (didn’t offer him a contract once already after all) and I can see Wheatley doing it (similar thinking to Marko’s on the matter), but I thought Seidl spoke to him?', 'The cooler quotes I took away are that Seb is becoming a farmer and grabbing an agricultural degree which is awesome. I must’ve missed this', ""This is the first time I've heard his retirement wasn't voluntary."", 'He needs to replace MBS', '\n\n>""Sebastian Vettel (37), the last German mega-star in Formula 1, has not yet officially retired from active motorsport. But his plans to compete with Porsche in the 24 Hours of Le Mans have been put on hold. For family reasons, it is said. The only thing that is certain is that Vettel will compete for Germany in the ""Race of Champions"" in Australia at the beginning of March - together with Mick Schumacher.\nUntil then, Vettel is studying for his degree in agriculture in Switzerland. After all, he needs a license to run his own farm. The four-time Formula 1 world champion has taken the “Direct Payment Agriculture Course” at the Pfäffikon Vocational Training Center (BBZ). “If I pass the course, I\'ll be able to run my own farm,” says Vettel.\nVettel wants to become a farmer\nAccording to the BBZ, course participants ""learn a lot about plant cultivation, animal husbandry and agricultural technology and are familiarized with ecological and animal-friendly farming. The course content also includes other aspects such as marketing, agricultural policy and farm management, including bookkeeping and financing.""\nThe current course has already taken its written exam in December 2024.\n\n\n\n>The oral exams will take place in April and May 2025 - so if Sebastian Vettel passes, he could officially call himself a farmer in just a few months. Vettel on his motivation to become a farmer: “The potential in agriculture fascinates me, also for the climate, for the changes and challenges we all face.”\n\n>Vettel is not quite finished with his Formula 1 career yet. He still feels fit enough, he says in an intimate circle. Fernando Alonso (43, Aston Martin) and Lewis Hamilton (40, Ferrari), who are still active, are much older. He will continue to look for a comeback opportunity.\nThis is fitting: His retirement at the end of 2022 was not entirely voluntary. Aston Martin did not want to extend his contract and others did not want to give him a new one.\nAt Audi, Vettel spoke to the then project manager Andreas Seidl and offered his services. However, Seidl preferred to chase Vettel\'s successor at Ferrari, Carlos Sainz, and ultimately signed Vettel\'s compatriot Nico Hülkenberg in order to have the token German at the Ingolstadt-based company.\n\n>Talks with Red Bull also failed. Helmut Marko (81), chief advisor to the Austrians and still a confidant of Vettel (they won four titles together from 2010 to 2013), told AUTO BILD: ""Sebastian would have liked to drive alongside Max Verstappen with us. But that wouldn\'t have made sense, also to protect him. Max would have clearly beaten him and damaged Sebastian\'s reputation. I could not and would not allow that.""\nDavid Coulthard (53), former Williams, McLaren-Mercedes and Red Bull driver, has a similar view. The Scottish Formula 1 icon strongly advises Vettel not to make any comeback plans in the future. His choice of words is not squeamish. ""He should leave it alone and stop dreaming that he will be faster after taking a few years off. The stopwatch doesn\'t lie. He wasn\'t quite up to speed at Aston Martin at the end either.""\nVettel will not like that. And despite everything, he will continue to look for his chance. Because anyone who knows him knows that the tractor won\'t be enough for him in the long run...', 'Lmao unnecessarily harsh from David talking about a 4 time WDC. Even if Seb privately is dreaming of a comeback, publically he has made no moves to that effect.', ""It fascinates me how Coulthard never passes up an opportunity to talk shit about someone else. Vettel hasn't said one word except for his farming talk and still DC is out here telling him to stop dreaming."", 'If Vettel wants to scratch that itch and a team lets him, good for him.', ""DC is just always frothing at the mouth to get a chance to talk shit about someone isn't he""]",255,85,0.87,255,134,134,39,6,0.010000000000000009,39

1iqsrdh,How big of an issue is cockpit position in the current generation of F1 cars?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iqsrdh/how_big_of_an_issue_is_cockpit_position_in_the/,2025-02-16, Discussion,"We know Lewis wanted the cockpit to be a little behind  and not so much in the front in the Merc cars. The recent Haas pics( [https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iqq24t/haas\_vf25\_leaked/](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iqq24t/haas_vf25_leaked/) ) suggest they have also moved the driver cockpit behind to get more space between the front tires and sidepods. I have read all of this on reddit, so, my source is a bit lacking, for lack of a better word. 

Now, I don't know how much Haas pushing the cockpit behind is due to them taking design cues from Ferrari or there's some performance gains that they see in this design philosophy.

What do you guys know/think?","[""I believe it's pretty up to preference and weight distribution."", 'The Haas drivers are also giants', '>We know Lewis wanted the cockpit to be a little behind and not so much in the front in the Merc cars.\xa0\n\n\nIt had to sit more forward on the W13 and W14 because their ultra tight packaging concept required it. They pushed it back on the W15 when they changed their car philosophy (more in line with the rest of the grid, because it was the concept with the most development potential). But Lewis still had trouble with the car, mainly because it had tyre overheating issues, especially at the rear, and lacked the rear downforce necessary to be able to do what Lewis wanted it to do (there\'s also a point to be made about him refusing, or failing, we don\'t know which, to adapt his driving style for three years).\xa0\n\n\nNow opinions vary on how important the cockpit position actually is. On an episode of *Beyond the Grid*, Martin Brundle was asked about it and his answer was essentially ""it\'s everything"" as it ties in with how much confidence a driver gets when he has the right feel for his car. And generally a confident driver is a fast driver.\xa0\n\n\nOn the other hand James Allison and engineers from other teams said it didn\'t matter that much. Regarding Merc, he said the cockpit position was a bit of a scapegoat and what really mattered was to make the car more stable. Russell never complained about it and did just fine either way, and ironically Lewis\' strongest season in terms of pace and consistency (2023) was with a car that had the forward cockpit. And the W14 wasn\'t particularly easier to drive than its successor', ""The change is so minor but fans and the media latched onto it to explain why Hamilton wasn't doing as well. When it got changed back nobody ever mentioned it since.\n\nNo other driver has ever brought it up either in the 12 years I've been following F1 across all the other reg changes. Even when more significant things were at play like the constant elongation of the Merc throughout the years with the longer wheelbase"", ""it changes how the driver perceives rotation in a car both through the wheel and ass feel\n\nusually it's more pronounced the farther back you are from the front axle, but idk how much that carries over in F1"", "">I believe it's pretty up to preference and weight distribution.\n\nMass distribution got tightened up years ago. Currently 0.446 and 0.539 Front-Rear rounded to the nearest half kilogram.\n\nSeat position will be a combination of packaging and preference. In the case of the W14 it was packaging. The seat was further forward than contemporary cars because Mercedes were trying to package the radiators really narrow for aero benefits."", 'I think it’s far more about centre of pressure from the aerodynamic platform. But so many other things limit where you can place it or where you are generating downforce from', ""The chassis design that would affect this would have been done well before they signed their current drivers though and isn't something they could easily adjust afterwards."", 'But if that is the case, what of the whole thing about how being underweight is good because using ballast helps weight distribution?']",79,14,0.87,79,121,121,8,0,0.0,8
