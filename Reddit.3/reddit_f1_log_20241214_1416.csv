I think he's a little more consistent this year, and a lot more patient. He's much more willing to let the race come to him instead of overdriving the car like he has done a few times in the past. Those are all traits people used to, and still do, praise Carlos for.\n\nCarlos, on the other hand, I think has learned from Charles how to extract more from the car. Carlos has always been a rapid driver but if I'm not wrong, in terms of pace, this year Carlos has been closer to Charles than ever. This year he did his best quali performance against Charles, and I don't think there were a lot of times where Charles left him in the dust (with 20s+ gaps) in the race, like there were in 2021-2023.

Red Bull outscored Mercedes by 121 points in the constructors. Checo finished the season on 152 points, meaning so long as he gave a 32 points swing over Mercedes, Red Bull would still outscore Mercedes.

His first 2 races were 2nd places, meaning he scored 36 points in those 2 races. In the remaining 22 races, he prevented 18 points from going to Mercedes via his finishing results. This means  Checo would have had to race Australia (where he scored 10 but didn't affect Mercedes who finished 17 (RUS) and retired (HAM)) and also Japan where he scored 18 points to secure the constructors bronze medal for Red Bull.

Most other teams can give 10mil.

Haas and any other team that finished higher this year than they did any of the previous three years can also give 12mil to their employees excluded from budget cap.

Edit: To do the math, assuming teams pay their full bonus, McLaren employees got a 20% increase in bonus compared to last year, and Red Bull employees got a 16.67% decrease. Now, teams might not choose to pay this much in bonuses. Individual teams might have goals they have to meet to get their bonuses by their individual employee contracts. Just like teams don't have to spend the whole budget cap in the first place. For instance, it might be in Red Bull's employee's contracts that they have to place top 3 in the WCC or no bonus at all. But they might have something much more lenient. Just like driver contracts, we don't know what are in employee contracts.

Quote from the regulations:

""Excluded Bonus Maximum Amount"" means:

(a) for each F1 Team that either wins the Constructors’ Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period, or achieves a higher finishing position in the Constructors’ Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period than it achieved in any of the previous three Reporting Periods, US Dollars 12,000,000; and

(b) for each other F1 Team, US Dollars 10,000,000""

I did this digging to comment on another post that the poster deleted, but I thought it was interesting and other people might not know, so I wanted to post it anyway.

He is only talked when, “Yuki deserves the RB seat” instead of him. But I want to talk a bit about “his” carreer. He drove only 5 races in 2023 and 6 in 2024. He did not even completed a whole season worth of races, two seasons combined. He lacks of experience especially compared to Yuki’s “4 full seasons” of experience. I believe he is a decent driver and can be a regular top 10 if he gains experience. For now, of couse if there’s somebody to be promoted, it is Yuki. But it doesn’t mean that Liam is a bad driver. He didn’t even have a full season worth of drive (11 races in total, correct me if i’m wrong), so it is not reasonable to compare the two and saying Lawson is bad.  He should gain experience to avoid RBR’s Gasly & Albon situation.  Also, even though how much I want Yuki to promote to the dark blue car, I don’t think Red Bull would gave one of the seats to a Honda driver considering Ford engines will come in 2026.

1hdwpvp,I hate the HUD from back in the day ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hdwpvp/i_hate_the_hud_from_back_in_the_day/,2024-12-14, Discussion,"Hey, guys!

New fan here, started watching F1 last year.

I’ve been doing some “research” for a while now. I’m currently watching every race from the 2012 season.

I simply hate how they used to display the gaps between drivers. You need to check the time really fast as it will soon disappear and show the gaps for the next group of cars.

I find it hard to follow on how the race is at that exact moment, comparing to nowadays where the times are always visible.

There are other things I don’t like, such as the radio messages, which have bad audio quality and that’s understandable, but providing subtitles doesn’t require that much technology.

The way they show the starting grid is also horrendous.

AND YES! I KNOW THAT WAS 12 YEARS AGO AND IT MAKES SENSE TO BE WORSE!

The whole point of this post is actually to ask if you guys miss anything from back in the day regarding HUD or anything broadcast related.","[""F1 was extremely slow to adapt its on-screen presentation to new technology and broadcasting standards. The graphics used until 2017 were essentially just coats of paint over the graphics introduced in 2004, when F1 was still broadcasting in standard definition 4:3.

With a lower resolution and less horizontal space on screen, having a vertical timing tower at all times would take up way more space, and they never changed that even after going widescreen in 2007 and eventually HD in 2011.\n\nThe fact that this finally changed in 2017 after Liberty took over suggests that this weird presentation style was something Bernie was still in charge of, which seems strange."", ""At least we didn't have the stupid AWS predictions onscreen and we had real images of tyres instead of the CGI version we have today while the actual tyres sit outside the Pirelli motorhome"", 'Yeah, people love to hate on Liberty but it was when they took over in 2017/2018 that the telemetry and presentation had a huge boost.', 'However many times I watch quali now, I just cannot get used to the double reference times on the new graphics.
