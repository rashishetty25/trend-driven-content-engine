1ldq23r,Got lucky and went to the F1 Movie premiere last night so here are my thoughts (no spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ldq23r/got_lucky_and_went_to_the_f1_movie_premiere_last/,2025-06-17, Discussion,"Hey all, I was lucky enough to win tickets to the world premiere of the new F1 movie last night (I never win tickets so 100% felt it wasn't real until I had them that night!), and I figured some of you might be curious about how it holds up, especially as fans.

Here are my main takeaways:

1. **The racing scenes are pretty incredible.** I'm not super into action, so maybe others will appreciate this even more than me but they feel fast, raw, pretty real and completely embedded in the F1 world. You can tell they put a lot of effort into shooting on track and used a lot of actual race footage which was cool. I recognised some of the moments from the season.
2. **The Apex GP team is really well done.** It felt like they genuinely belonged on the grid. I left wanting to follow them like they were a real team, kind of like how I get invested in certain back marker teams via Drive to Survive. 
3. **There are a few unrealistic bits.** Nothing huge, but if you're a fan, you'll definitely know some moments or 'liberties' were taken for the sake of the storyline. That said, it didn’t ruin the experience for me, it was funny at times (should have at least been a yellow...).
4. **A lot of Easter eggs for fans.** There were definitely a lot of nods to F1 fans/the fandom - down to the right pets being in the paddock. I appreciated that and it’s clear the movie was made with fans in mind.

As for the premiere itself, it was definitely a cool experience, though I wish there had been a bit more for the fans. I don’t think the drivers stayed for the screening (most of the big names left after a short on-stage intro). I understand though as I guess it was more of an industry/influencer event. So overall it still felt surreal to be there, saw some F1 personalities and I feel incredibly lucky to have experienced it. Especially just being in the same room as Lewis Hamilton, that was enough ha. 

I think you'll all enjoy it and looking forward to the discussions!

Since Imola, at least one driver in a Mercedes-powered car has retired in every race due to PU issues. It's starting to feel like clockwork at this point.

Interestingly, McLaren are the only Mercedes-powered team that haven’t been hit yet. I was on edge the entire Canadian GP—my anxiety levels were off the charts. If they had cut to Kimi or George pulled over with another PU failure, I honestly don’t know what I would've done. 😅

Does anyone have any insight into what might be causing this? It seems odd for these kinds of reliability issues to crop up this far into the regulation cycle. Could it be related to pushing the limits on performance updates? Or maybe it's just bad luck catching up?

(Though, according to Shov, they wouldn't have continued the race like that anyway.)  \n  \nFor George a wiring loom short circuited which caused the ignition electrics on the car to fail. Mercedes said it was an issue they hadn't seen before with this PU and that they would be checking and applying any necessary fixes to the entire pool of PUs.  \n  \nAs for Alex, I haven't been able to find any information from Williams about the exact nature of the PU failure he experienced and if it could be related to either of the issues Kimi and George had.

What impact will the McLaren collision have on the team structure? And how could Nico Rosberg possibly help Norris?**\n\n> Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once wrote the following lines in his poem ""The Sorcerer\'s Apprentice"": ""The spirits I summoned, I will not be rid of now."" After the tenth Grand Prix of the year, this sentence could almost be applied identically to the best Formula 1 team of this season.\n\n> Ahead of the Canadian Grand Prix, drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris spoke to the media on Thursday (June 12). After the first third of the season, it had become clear that Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris were likely to battle it out for the world championship title. While the competition exhibited more erratic performance, McLaren shone with consistency.\n\n> The drivers know this, too. Regarding past internal team friction in the fight for the World Championship crown, Norris wisely said, ""Something will happen at some point."" And just three days later, he put his own words into action at the Montreal race.\n\n> Norris attacked Piastri in the hairpin on lap 66. However, his rival braked later before the final chicane and stayed ahead. Norris gained more momentum on the finish straight and tried to position himself to the left of the sister car. However, there was no room because the championship leader was covering the inside lane. Norris slammed into the rear of his teammate and then into the concrete wall. His race was over, and Piastri retained his fourth place.\n\n> **""It was only a matter of time.""**\nAbout an hour after the race, team principal Andrea Stella spoke to the journalists on site. The boss of the two rivals seemed composed: ""It was only a matter of time. It wasn\'t a question of \'if,\' but of \'when.\' Now we have certainty and can say: \'Canada 2025.\' Of course, we don\'t want that at McLaren. We\'ll have to have some discussions now.""\n\n> However, the famous ""papaya rules"" are not being put under review. There won\'t be a complete ban on attacks by team orders: ""Of course, we could control everything from the command post, but we don\'t want that. That would be artificial racing. We want to give both drivers the chance to fight for positions – also among themselves,"" explained Stella.\n\n> Norris himself had already apologized for the incident in the car. He then doubled down in the press conference. ""I simply misjudged it. It was my mistake, I take full responsibility, and I apologize to my entire team and to Oscar for attempting something like that.""\n\n> As Piastri spoke to journalists in the mixed zone, Norris approached him and apologized personally with a handshake to the Australian. Stella emphasized Norris\'s behavior: ""It\'s good that Lando immediately took responsibility. He simply misjudged the situation on the track. I\'m sure he\'ll learn from this and emerge stronger.""\n\n> **Does Norris need mental help?**\nSome experts may disagree. While Piastri has made fewer mistakes this year and is also assessing situations better in most duels, Norris seems to repeatedly slip up under pressure. He already made two errors in qualifying. Piastri started the Montreal GP, which was a poor performance by McLaren standards, from P3, while Norris had to start from seventh.\n\n> The fact that the two ultimately clashed on Sunday was also due to their differing strategies. Piastri used the medium rubber in the first stint, then switched to the hard tires twice. Norris preferred to start the race on the C4 tire. The long first stint and the intermediate sprint on the medium brought him within striking distance of his World Championship rival.\n\n> But Norris\'s good race pace ultimately didn\'t help him. Last year\'s runner-up left Canada 22 points behind Piastri. As he walked through the paddock, the weight of the defeat was evident on his face. He took a deep breath and kept his head down.\n\n> **Rosberg offers Norris help.**\nFormer champion and Sky expert Nico Rosberg has often noticed the Formula 1 driver\'s ups and downs. The former Mercedes driver knows from personal experience the psychological strain of a World Championship battle. He believes Norris needs a mentor of sorts to support him off the track, like Mark Webber does with Piastri.\n\n> ""I\'ve already offered him my help and written to him. But unfortunately, he hasn\'t responded. Maybe it will still happen,"" Rosberg revealed in front of the cameras. Rosberg himself had brought a mental coach onto the team during the 2016 season. The psychological support also helped him win the 2016 World Championship battle against Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton.\n\n> Rosberg subsequently decided to retire. After three years of friction and internal battles, calm returned to Mercedes. McLaren isn\'t quite there yet. Canada was the first incident of this kind. But the ghosts themselves summoned them.', 'They need rules of engagement.\n\nTeam orders won’t work here. They’re each others championship rival.']",7,22,0.57,7,235,235,0,0,0.0,0

Let's ignore the back markers and just focus on the top 4 or maybe 5 teams. In no particular order:

- Mercedes: Russell is proving that he can lead the team in the post Hamilton era and has managed to keep himself a close as possible to the McLarens. The season is still long and for now he can't be ruled out. Antonelli has been super solid so far and his podium shows that he can deliver under pressure. The recent unreliability of the car makes him a bit harder to judge though.

- Red Bull: Max is Max and if you ignore his idiotic brawl with Russell it's fair to say that he has gotten the most out of the car and, same as Russell, has kept himself in the fight. Let's not talk about the second seat.

- Ferrari: Ferrari is doing Ferrari things which, same as in previous seasons, makes this pairing rather hard to judge. Mainly Hamilton. Has he lost the edge? Is he still adjusting? Is he getting swallowed by the usual Ferrari drama? Chuck is doing what he can with what the team is giving him.

- McLaren: easily the strongest pairing imo and the driver standings show that. They have the best car on most tracks and both Norris and Piastri are delivering as expected. On an individual level, neither might be on the same level as Max and maybe Chuck, but they are as close as one can get. Neither have been flawless, of course. 

So for me it's McLaren first and then a close fight between Merc and Ferrari, with Red Bull being a distant fourth simply because they effectively only have one car. It's their luck Max is as good as he is.

1ldzuqh,In defence of Esteban Ocon,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ldzuqh/in_defence_of_esteban_ocon/,2025-06-17, Discussion,"hello fellow f1 fans. I've noticed a lot of negativity surrounding Esteban Ocon, with people claiming that he has a reputation of not being a team player, didn't deserve his seat, etc. however, I have watched a few of his interviews and he seems to be a humble, genuine man. if you disagree on certain points, I would love to hear your reasoning and am open to discussion.

**pierre gasly**

it's quite obvious that the two are not best friends and are never going to be, but nobody knows the full story except the two of them. Pierre is the only one that has shared his side of the story, so we never will know exactly what happened and we can't jump to conclusions. Pierre blamed Esteban and that's pretty much the only information we have about their rift. that doesn't mean the fight wasn't necessarily Esteban's fault, also that we shouldn't just assume if we haven't heard both sides. as an Alpine and Gasly fan, I am glad that they worked together professionally.

**max verstappen**

it was obvious that Esteban should have allowed Verstappen to pass instead of trying to unlap himself, and I believe that he was in the wrong for trying to get ahead when Verstappen was clearly chasing the win that day. However, Verstappen's reaction after the race was impulsive and disrespectful. you can be frustrated with a result without crossing boundaries and being unprofessional. I don't understand why people are justifying Verstappen's actions.

**friendships**

Ocon has stated that he is friends with Mick Schumacher and Lance Stroll, the latter being another driver that a lot of F1 fans love to hate (even though we don't know him as a person either). This has led to speculation by some that Ocon only wants to be friends with the two of them because of their fathers' influence. I saw a great comment by u/quantinuum on this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/viunwg/the\_driver\_with\_the\_poorest\_background\_on\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/viunwg/the_driver_with_the_poorest_background_on_the/) explaining how professional and respectful Ocon was when he lost his seat to Stroll.

**background**

I once saw Esteban described as someone who F1 fans say they want to support from a driver they don't want to support. This is clearly represented in his background and the working class beginnings where his career started. Esteban has frequently spoken about gratitude and appreciation to his parents for their sacrifices. meanwhile, I have seen people say things like ""it's a shame that nobody can root for a driver like him"" when acknowledging how powerful his backstory is.

thank you for reading and I would love to hear your thoughts on this topic, whether or not you agree.","['It’s funny that you’re trying to understand why people don’t like Ocon, but then throw out that people ‘hate Lance Stroll for good reason’.\xa0\n\nNobody should hate any drivers.
