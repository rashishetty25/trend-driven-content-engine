1i2p8a7,O'Wards' story on his French denied Super License.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i2p8a7/owards_story_on_his_french_denied_super_license/,2025-01-16, Discussion,"Recently Pato O'Ward went to a Mexican podcast called ""Creativo"", one of the clips that went kinda viral or at least gained some notoriety is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZShqdZPECbg). Pato had previously talked about it, mentioning that only that the FIA did not wanna give him his SL, but in this podcast he expanded.

O'Ward says that after getting P8 with Carlin in Indycar, Helmut got in contact with him an gave him a Formula 1 contract for what would have been 2020. Patricio says that he was on his way to F1, that Charlie Whiting gave the green light and all. Charlie dies and a new team arrives, referred by O'Ward as ""the French team"", they block O'Ward's SL due to a lack of points by not counting his Indy Lights points due to the number of cars not meeting the minimum to reward full points. This is the part when he is sent to Japan to get points, that he does not receive because he does not complete the season. In the end, O'Ward claims that the FIA did it on purpose to protect ""A Frenchman"" from losing his seat (honestly, just should have said Gasly, with the timeframe is very clear).

While I don't doubt there were politics involved because FIA, I find interesting that depending on who he talks to, his tone changes. In both english and spanish he is kinda hostile to the FIA, but in english has claimed ""Red Bull let me go"", while in spanish verions (i've seen) of the story is ""I cut with Red Bull"" (as if he was the one leaving, not Marko telling him to go).

So, for a contract for 2020, they would count either 2016, 2017, 2018 in an application for a SL during 2019, or 2017, 2018, 2019 for an application in 2020.\n\nGetting the license in 2019:  \n2016: NACAM F4, 3rd, 7 points.

1i36lmy,How is Jack Doohan STILL managed by Flavio Briatore?!,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1i36lmy/how_is_jack_doohan_still_managed_by_flavio/,2025-01-17, Discussion,"After reading into this‚Ä¶holy conflict of interest Batman, and why on earth would he continue to have Flavio as his manager?!

Jack Doohan is managed by Flavio Briatore. The same Flavio who‚Äôs both;

- Executive Director of the team he‚Äôs on
- Seems to be quite actively sabotaging his own clients career in favour of Franco.  

As someone in talent management, this isn‚Äôt just ‚Äòan account‚Äô, someone is putting their passion and livelihood in your hands to maximize their career potential and earnings. Flavio being Jack‚Äôs manager makes sense‚Ä¶until he went to Alpine. 

Toto Wolff manage(d) Esteban Ocon and Valterri Bottas. When there was conflict of interest with them being a part of Mercedes F1, Toto separated himself from the conflict of interest to other reps to keep church vs state, until it came to external negotiations (that scene in DTS where Toto‚Äôs on the phone with Cyril). 

Once Flavio joined Alpine, immediately Flavio should‚Äôve enacted the same. Taking on a role at Alpine would also be his priority, also arguably a reason to look elsewhere for representation if I were Team Jack. But, for some reason‚Ä¶this never happened. 

With the news that Alpine actually scooped up Franco‚Ä¶ya‚Äôll know he‚Äôll be in that seat sometime in 2025‚Ä¶Flavio, still being his manager is f‚Äôing shocking. 

- His own manager is actively working against his own client, to put in someone else into the team! Beyond the talent of Franco, I‚Äôll take a wager Flavio sees a profit share from extra sponsors Franco brings in, and to add value to Alpine in advance of selling to increase the value of his own payout. 

- If you were Jack, on top of all this, how can you confide and speak openly with your ‚Äòmanager‚Äô when he‚Äôs also at the top of the team and absolutely could (and probably would) use that information against you to further the argument to drop him for Franco.


What am I missing here? How the hell could Jack still be managed by Flavio, what a VERY scummy thing for Flavio to set up for Jack‚Ä¶

How is this not being covered more by F1 news?! 
  ","['He picked Flavio as his manager to begin with‚Ä¶ despite his well documented past of shenanigans. Maybe jack believes that without him he would have no chance at all - and maybe he is right about that. \n\nOnly a hand full of people know the truth and they aren‚Äôt writing articles about it.', '>How is this not being covered more by F1 news?!\n\nBecause it is nothing new?\n\nFlavio was the team manager of Benetton, bought Ligier solely to get their Renault-engines to Benetton, then did a deal with Mugen-Honda so they would breach their contract with Minardi, so Ligier got the Mugen-engines, sold 50% to Tom Walkinshaw (who he had hired as an engineering director for Benetton previously). Sued Minardi, Minardi counter-sued. He settled with Minardi, paying off Minardis debt to Briatore and the Mugen-breach.   \nNow, you may wonder what debts Minardi had to Briatore? Well, in addition to running Benetton, buying Ligier etc. he also handled customer deals with old Ford engines, a deal that Minardi had signed for 1993, but not getting what they were promised. So they made an own deal with Ford/Cosworth themselves for 94, and not paying Briatore.  \nAnyway, while still running Benetton and having finished off the Ligier, Mugen-Honda, Minardi issues, he then bought shares of the Minardi team(!). Trying to then sell it off to British American Tobacco, but failed (BAT would later buy Tyrrell and enter as BAR in 1999). He then sold his share back to Minardi and Gabriele Rumi again. The following year Benetton decided to replace Briatore with David Richards (yes, the Prodrive, Subaru World Rally Team man).\n\nThis didn\'t stop Briatore from being involved in F1 though. He and Bruno Michel (that is GP2, F2 Bruno Michel) set up SuperTec, who started to supply the 1997 Renault F1 engines that Mecachrome still assembled, after Mecachrome had done the supply themselves in 1998. When Renault decided to return to F1 in 2001 (still running under the Benetton name), they also bought out SuperTec from Briatore and appointing Briatore as a team principal for the team.  \nAt the same time, Briatore had started to get heavily in to managing drivers, and while he by many is accredited with ""finding"" Fernando Alonso, he bought out Alonsos 5 year contract with Minardi, and ending up placing Alonso to race for Minardi in 2001.  \nThe next few years he would manage Mark Webber, Jarno Trulli, Nelson Piquet jr, Heikki Kovalainen and others. Possibly the strangest way he handled that was firing Jarno Trulli while being his manager. The double-dipping is also one of the reasons Piquet jr did what he did.\n\nSo... Briatore being Doohans manager while also having his role at Alpine is extremely mild and neutral in Briatore-terms...\n\nFun thing though according to one of the co-managers for Colapinto, some of Colapintos sponsors will stay at Williams, and the deal is a 5 year loan(!?!)', "">His own manager is actively working against his own client, to put in someone else into the team!\n\nYou say this, but in reality Jack Doohan is currently a Formula 1 driver.

I'd wager his chances would have been quite a bit lower."", ""The fact Briatore is even allowed in any motor racing paddock after crashgate is the messed up bit.\n\nI don't have so much of a problem with drivers being managed by team principals, it's not too different to how drivers are part of academies linked to the F1 teams."", ""Flavio is very close with his dad.\n\nI think most of the smoke about Jack being a dead man walking is coming from the Latin media and Franco's management tbh.\n\nI think the stronger possibility is they think Gasly has a move away lined up in the near future and they want cover for that. \n\nAnd of course that comes with the added bonus of having a replacement ready to step in Jack proves to be out of his depth."", 'Literally after the news of Franco my first thought was ""Who tf manages Doohan"" and my jaw dropped as soon as I googled it.', "">Jack Doohan is managed by Flavio Briatore.

Let me know your Top 3.

My predictions:

1. WDC Champion: Charles Leclerc
2. WDC Vice-Champion: Lewis Hamilton
3. Third Place: Lando Norris

I do believe that if Ferrari provides a Championship level car (or even close), Charles & Lewis are both the favorites (I believe they will provide a very good car hence my top 2 but they are interchangeable). 

I think McLaren will have a very very good car but Lando isn‚Äôt ready yet to challenge and same goes for Oscar, he is to inconsistent.

Regarding Redbull and verstappen, unfortunately I don‚Äôt see them delivering a good car for max to be able to challenge for the title next year.

Finally, concerning Mercedes It‚Äôs been 3 years and they still don‚Äôt seem to understand the current regulations and haven‚Äôt show the capacity to build a championship level car. So Goerge won‚Äôt be anywhere near the top, tho he might win 1 or 2 gps.","[""I think the biggest thing working against either Charles or Lewis is the fact that they will split points. Unless Ferrari absolutely dominates, I don't see them being 1-2. I do think Charles has the best chance out of the two for 2025.\n\nRed Bull's problems have been overblown in my opinion. I think the car last year was temperamental when pushed to the level of competition that was occurring...but the car is fast. And Max has no teammate to worry about.\n\nI think Norris has the most straightforward path if he can keep Piastri under control and they commit to WDC early on.
