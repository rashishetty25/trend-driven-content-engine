The Ferrari driver did not hide his disappointment for the poor results obtained in the first seven events of the year, in which he collected only 61 points and a podium in the Jeddah race .\n\n\n\nLeclerc: ‚ÄúWe are not satisfied with the car‚Äù\n\n\nFerrari had closed 2024 by challenging McLaren for the Constructors\' title until the final corners of the last Grand Prix of the year. The great design revolution involving the SF-25 should have allowed it to take that further step forward that the 2024 single-seater, now at the maximum of its development, would not have been able to guarantee.\n\n\nSo, at least for now, it has not been and from this point Leclerc\'s judgment on the current season starts: "" Clearly, it is negative . We are not at all satisfied with the performance of the car. Last year we ended the season fighting for the Constructors\' World Championship. So we had a lot of ambition to try to win the title this year . We are fully committed to trying to recover the performance lost compared to McLaren and Red Bull in particular .""\n\n\nThe winter objective now seems compromised, considering the big gap in the general classification accumulated in these first months. On the horizon, however, is the Spanish GP, an event that could bring a small revolution in the values on the track: ‚Äú It is simply impossible for me to say that a good season would mean finishing fourth, third, etc. Honestly, I will believe it until the end ,‚Äù said Leclerc. ‚Äú Last year, we had an ultra-dominant Red Bull in the first seven races, and then a McLaren that recovered strongly. I hope we can have this kind of turnaround starting from Barcelona. In Spain, there will be a change to the technical regulation for the wings , which we have worked a lot on. It should be an advantage for us , but it remains uncertain. So we must win all the points possible until Barcelona .‚Äù\n\n\nMonte Carlo: an encore is difficult, but‚Ä¶\n\n\nWhile waiting for the possible breakthrough in Barcelona, there is the most expensive race for Leclerc to face. The Ferrari driver finally broke his personal curse last year, obtaining his first success on the streets of Monte Carlo.\n\n\nA repeat this year seems very difficult, even if Leclerc leaves a small hope open: ‚Äú I am only aiming for the win. The podium is not something I particularly dream of. For several Grands Prix, our weak points have been the slow corners .

The relationship with the seven-time world champion is very good and Leclerc remains convinced that the hiring of a driver with the experience of the British driver has been positive for him too: ‚Äú For me, nothing changes. It\'s a huge learning opportunity for me, because he\'s one of the legends of F1. But it\'s also a great motivation and an opportunity to show what I can do with Lewis at my side in the same car .‚Äù\n\n\nInteresting is what Leclerc said about Hamilton‚Äôs characteristics from which he has learned the most so far: ‚Äú The discipline and his work ethic. Carlos (Sainz) was also a hard worker, but Lewis is a hard worker in a different way , and it‚Äôs really interesting to see the dynamics within the team. How does he handle problems? How does he comment on the car during development? It‚Äôs always interesting for every driver to be able to analyse how their teammate collaborates with their engineers .‚Äù\n\n\nAmong the positive aspects of working with Hamilton, Leclerc also mentioned the driving style: ‚Äú He is extremely talented, he has a very interesting driving style, which I can use myself in certain moments of the race , when it is the right time.

VER gained some speed on ALO between Mirabeau and the Hairpin (T6), but failed to make advancements at the Hairpin, second Mirabeau (T7), Portier (T8) and through the tunnel (T9). Worse, ALO had a better approach of Nouvelle (T10&11), carrying more top speed into Tabac (T12), where he also made a better approach with lifting later. VER was then, after Tabac and the end of sector 2, 0.204sec behind ALO.   
Going into the swimming pool, VER hustled through T13&14, gaining some speed on ALO. Taking also a bit more speed through T15&16 and having a higher top speed exiting T17. Inbetween Rascasse (T18) and the final turn, T19, VER stepped onto the gas slightly more than ALO, allowing for a better exit out of the final turn.

As we sat on the terrace of the H√¥tel de Paris, sipping Cinzano, we joined in the classic pre-event speculation: Who would come through first in that hell-for-leather opening lap? Moss, surely. Or Brabham. But which? The city hushed. The engines were started, a sound of sixteen angry lions. The starter began to count down. Off beyond our vision, a flag was dropped. The loudspeakers exploded, a babel of French and English lost under the thunder of accelerating machines. The street before us was empty. There was that long, delicious, agonizing, moment of suspense, then the ferocious sound of the cars as they rocketed up the hill and toward the hotel turn.\n\n"" Is it Moss?""\n\n"" Is it Brabham?""\n\nNeither. The first car around, bellowing as it sank its fingernails into the cement, was a lo-slung, dark-blue BRM, and the driver was Sweden‚Äôs champion, Joakim Bonnier. Snapping at his heels was Jack Brabham, in a Cooper, and joined to Brabham was the Lotus of Stirling Moss. A few yards behind came the British dental surgeon Tony Brooks and the young ace whose career ended tragically a week later at Spa-Francorchamps. Chris Bristow. Then the rest of the pack. snarling and pushing. Baron Wolfgang Berghe Graf von Trips, known to intimates as Taffy, or von Crash, provided momentary horror as his Ferrari burst into flames. Von Trips might have evacuated the machine, but chose instead a different method. He went so fast toward Beau Rivage that the downrush of air simply blew out the fire. He continued in ninth place.\n\nMeanwhile, Bonnier was building his lead. The BRM had a reputation for unreliability, but while it kept together it was a formidable machine. To anyone unfamiliar with its history of burst engines and broken suspensions, it must have seemed unbeatable. And so it was, for a great many laps. Then Moss decided it was time to stop hanging about. He passed Brabham and took after Bonnier. At the ten-lap mark, the bearded Swede led by just 0.8 second.\n\nAs if this were not exciting enough, races within races were going on back in the field. Phil Hill was whipping his immense Ferrari past car after car, and was now preparing to bull by Brooks. Little Richie Ginther, of California, had a handful with his rear-engine prototype, hut he was driving smoothly and the experimental Ferrari was ahead of several lighter, faster machines.\n\nOn lap seventeen Moss roared into the lead and began to pull away. Then Brabham passed Bonnier, and the stage was set for another battle of the giants. But Bonnier refused to cooperate. He went by Brabham and set off after Moss, who was now 4.7 seconds ahead. All three were traveling at an average speed which was considerably faster than the lap records of other years.\n\nThen it began to rain. To the spectators this was a mild discomfort; to the drivers, a nightmare. The streets became spippery as oiled glass. A feeling of dread crept into the air, as the inevitable incidents started. Roy Salvadori went by his pits indicating that he would need a visor. Suddenly his Cooper slid out of control and collided viciously with the barriers at the Virage des Gazom√™tres. Phil Hill tried to hang onto his brute arround the Casino bend, lost it, got it back somehow, and slithered on. Brabham the CarefuI was suddenly going like a madman. He got closer to Moss every lap, then, on the thirty-fourth, passed into the lead, which he began to stretch. Moss was expected to attack, but he did not. Perhaps he knew what was going to happen. It is difficult to explain otherwise how he was able to avoid disaster. For on the forty-first lap. Brabham spun. Moss came around Sainte-D√©v√¥te to findthe lead Cooper revolving wildly. An accident seemed inevitable, but Moss gave the wheel a quick flick, missed the gyrating Cooper by millimeters, and went through. Brabham ended his race against the retaining wall\n\nAnd still rained. Dark mist capped the terraced hills, turning the bright houses gray. We sat wondering now, with everyone else, if Moss had beaten his jinx. His lead seemed unassailable, yet ‚Äì\n\nOn the sixtieth lap the dark-blue Lotus failed to come around. The crowd groaned. Moss was out of it, cheated again. But only for a few moments. He had had stopped at the pits when the power had begun to fail in his engine. A plug lead had come adrift. Moss replaced it himself and continued.\nMore incidents occurred. McLaren lost control of his Cooper, allowing Phil Hill and Graham Hill to catch up. Then Graham Hill lost his BRM, crashing into the Radio Monte-Carlo commentary box and all but demolishing the building ‚Äì fortunately with no serious harm to anyone.\n\nNow the rain slacked off. Moss turned a number of incredible laps below one minute 36.8, under the mistaken impression that he had only five instead of thirty-five to go, then settled into a steady winning pace. Bonnier dropped out, after a fine run. Gurney, never confident of the car, brought his BRM into the pits with broken suspension. Other machines limped in, like cripples, or stopped dead.\n\nThe spectators were all cheering for Moss, praying that nothing would happen to stop a well-deserved victory. Nothing did. The checkered flag fell on the dark-blue Lotus, and Stirling Moss won the Eighteenth Grad Prix de Monaco at 67.68 mph by 52.1 seconds from Bruce McLaren (Cooper-Climax), who was followed home by Phil Hill (Ferrari) and Tony Brooks (Yeoman Credit Cooper).\n\nMoss was buried in roses. The little Lotus, which had gone so fast, sputtered around the city for its victory lap, and you could see only the roses and the driver‚Äôs happy smile. The G.P. was over. The sky turned gray, and the rain began to fall again in a silver mist. And all that was left of the danger and the excitement now were three broken rose petals, glowing red in the dark street.\n\nBut the festival was not yet completed. For now it was time for the traditional gala. The drivers went to their hotels, scrubbed the grease and oil from their skin, doffed their racing overalls, donned their soup-and-fish and scurried over to the Hotel de Paris. We joined them in the Empire Room, and marveled at the transformation that had taken place. No longer were they heroes and fools. They were young men having a spree. Deadly enemies only a few hours earlier, the pilotos were now gathered in wild camaderie on the dance floor of the elegant Empire Room, dancing mambos, trading partners, and generally having a hell of a time. Traditionally, the Prince and Princess joined the celebration, but they didn‚Äôt slow it down. The regal, ermine-cool Grace made an entrance out of The Prisoner of Zenda ‚Äì slow drum roll, crowd standing at attention ‚Äì but very soon she melted and joined the mad melee on the floor, which lasted until dawn.\n\nThey‚Äôll be dancing there again this year. The streets will thunder again, and again there will be the thrill of speed, the joy of victory and the bitter challenge of defeat. Hard as it is to imagine, the festival will probably be greater than ever. Porsches will be joining the fray, Ferrari will have its super-light, 290-horsepower threat, and you may be sure the Coopers and Lotuses won‚Äôt be slower, and maybe the new rear-engine Scarabs will be ready.

Road cars are easy to drive b/c they have a big heavy flywheels which make slipping the clutch and keeping the engine running very easy (regardless of the number of plates).

This completely wrong. First of all, high torque makes the engine more difficult to stall. Second, the V10 Renault in the Top Gear clip has a torque of \\~440 Nm at 16.000rpms. That is the same amount of torque as any German 2l diesel sedan, such a BMW 320d at 2000rpms.\n\nThis engine is powerful because it can operate at up to 19.000rpms, but it has a tiny amount of torque at low-rpms.\n\nYou really need very high rpms when releasing the cluch not to stall.

And the engineer tells you ""Rev it to 9000rpms, and release the clutch"". Would yo do it? No, you would be scared of doing that because you know that the car will start accelerating too fast. So you would first try to use lower rpms and release the clutch slowly, which would make the engine stall.', ""The clutch is very reactive and precise and it's operated by a paddle on the steering wheel rather as a pedal, so it isn't immediately intuitive."", 'Those V10s and V8s actually had very limited torque.\n\nAnd a tiny hand clutch with zero feel.']",73,80,0.83,73,75,75,27,3,0.04999999999999993,27

1kt19k6,Should red flags be used at all in qualifying when a driver is on a hot lap?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kt19k6/should_red_flags_be_used_at_all_in_qualifying/,2025-05-22, Discussion,"Obviously inspired by the Bearman drama. The question is straightforward: should red flags be used at all in qualifying when a driver is on a hot lap?

Some reasons in favour of banning red flags:

* Any driver between the timing control line and the crash will have their lap negated by the double yellows
* Any driver between the crash and the timing control line can't cause an issue relevant to the crash site
* This makes qualifying more fair as there is less of a risk of a driver being dropped due to an incident that otherwise have had no bearing on their lap time

Some reasons against:

* There would need to be an exception where the driver will need help exiting the car due to the severity of the crash, perhaps a couple of other carve-outs
* Sometimes in life you are unlucky and that sucks, as happened to Bearman
* Any driver who is not between the pit entry and the timing control line could have entered the pits to avoid going past the crash on their in-lap
* This happens fairly rarely so do we really need to make the rules more complicated

I'm sure others will share more reasons for or against changing how red flags are used","['>Some reasons against:\n\nDeath', 'Are you serious?
