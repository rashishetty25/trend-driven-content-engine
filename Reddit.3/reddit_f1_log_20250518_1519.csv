Smh"", 'This is getting more and more embarrassing', '‚ÄúCopy pasta‚Äù', 'Here\'s a translation of the article\n\nLike a fortnight ago in Florida, the SF-25s failed to take advantage of the new tyres and found themselves excluded in Q2, so they will start 11th and 12th. The team principal has apologised to the fans, but continues to believe that the potential is greater than seen and that there were also shortcomings in execution.\n\nDisaster. That is really the only word one can use to comment on Ferrari\'s qualifying at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix. No one expected a miracle from the SF-25, as Lewis Hamilton had been asking for patience from the fans since Thursday. But probably no one would have expected to see both Reds eliminated at the end of Q2 either, with Charles Leclerc starting 11th just ahead of the seven-time world champion.\n\nThe problem was that, while everyone else improved on their last attempt, the two Ferraris, on the other hand, when they mounted the new soft tyres, were unable to improve on the time they had set on the used ones. A script already seen in Miami, which was also repeated on a very different track. And a problem that is therefore becoming quite an Achilles heel for the men from the Cavallino. But team principal Fred Vasseur is also well aware of this.\n\n""It\'s almost a copy-paste of what happened a fortnight ago in Miami, we couldn\'t improve the with the new set of tyres and we did the fastest lap with the first set in Q2. Why? If we knew, we would have solved it by now, but it\'s true that it\'s a strange situation, although I think it was a bit strange for everyone today with the tyres. The pace was decent, because if you look at the first stint we were fifth and sixth with the used tyres, but then with the new set we couldn\'t improve, while the others did it by three or four tenths and we paid the price,"" Vasseur told the Sky Sport F1 microphones.\n\nDuring the link-up, he was heard to hear Leclerc explain that in his opinion the problem is that there is simply no potential in the SF-25. A thought the French manager only partly shares: ""I think the problem today was 50-50 between execution and potential, because I think if we had done everything right we would have finished fourth and fifth. The execution was not right, because we have to make the car work for what it is worth and today that didn\'t happen, because with the new tyres we didn\'t confirm the positions we had with the used tyres. But the potential is not good either, because the goal is not to be fifth and sixth. But it\'s a balancing act between the two, both execution and potential are lacking"".\n\nToday several competitor cars, including Aston Martin, were presenting new packages, while at Ferrari they are still talking about understanding the current one. Vasseur was therefore asked whether this process is well advanced: \'If I say yes, then I am a fool if you see what we did today. But today I think the Aston Martins are the only ones who did all the qualifying on medium tyres and ended up finishing fifth, so there was something unusual.\n\nThe problem is that the upgrades will also have to be understood when they arrive, but according to Vasseur that does not seem to be the point: ""When we talk about upgrades we always talk about tenths or hundredths of a second, we are certainly not talking about half a second. What we can do with the tyres, on the other hand, can be worth even half a second. It\'s more there maybe that we have to try to understand and get something out of it.\n\nThe race pace yesterday was good, so you can try to attack, even if starting so far back at Imola is a big handicap: ""Everything is always open, because our race pace yesterday was good, but it is also true that it is very difficult to overtake here, so we will have to be very lucid and maybe even try some risks in terms of strategy.\n\nLeclerc publicly apologised to the fans, a sentiment also espoused by the team principal: ""We have nothing more to say or do. We have thousands of fans on the track and it was not what we expected for them, so we have to apologise, but we also have to focus on the future and tomorrow, trying to do our best for them and for us.""\n\nFred should make ""Potential"" his middle name.', 'Copy and paste you say?

So there clearly is a significant delay between the gantry lights and the digital flag panels.         \nAlso the gantry lights show red at end of session which makes it harder to see the Orange abort lights above them.\n\nThere shouldn't be a delay and I'd probably do something about the signals so that the red flag signal overrides the end of session signal."", 'Realistically what can happen now?', 'To me the best solution would be to have the race director announce ""RED FLAG"" as he presses the button which is transmitted in real time to the drivers, and make that the deciding factor on when the session is stopped. If you hear ""RED FLAG"" before you finish your lap, then it doesn\'t count. \n\nI\'m not sure what else you can really do rather than provide a very clear signal that all drivers out on track receive at the same time. I guess if it\'s deemed safe enough you could allow any driver who has passed the crash site to finish the lap, but it\'s not ideal to then have potentially 15 cars going past an accident when marshals and other rescue workers are trying to get to the scene.', ""Why does everyone think it matters WHEN Bearman saw the light? it's about the fac tthe track was red. lights not showing up at the right time don't matter. what if a light had broken? you can just keep racing?"", 'Thus begins the ""Flag-Gate""', 'FIA really should tighten up the sporting regulations. They are such a mess and almost every paragraph has something like this where it is unclear whether the session is suspended from the time the clerk of the course decides to suspend it, from when he starts sending out the message, from when it shows on the official timing screens, from when a single red or orange flag starts lighting up, from all red flags start lighting up, from when the orange flag lights up, from when both the red and orange flags light up.\n\nIt would be so easy to say something like ""when the clerk of the course decides to suspend a race an official message is sent out on the official timing channel with a millisecond precision timestamp. The session is considered suspended as of that timestamp. If the official timing channel is malfunctioning the clerk can instead directly order red flags to be shown and the session is considered suspended as soon as any marshall starts waving a red flag anywhere on the track.""\n\nThe regulations are filled with vague descriptions and literally impossible requirements (e.g. for pit lane it starts require constant speed and throttle before coming to a stop at end of pit, but constant speed is impossible and you must reduce speed before coming to a stop but it isn\'t specified how much ahead of the pit exit you can deviate from the constant speed). Everyone probably knows what is meant and expected, but would really help if they just spelled it out before it becomes an issue.

1kp2ilw,[AMuS] The Aston Martin Miracle of Imola,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kp2ilw/amus_the_aston_martin_miracle_of_imola/,2025-05-17, News,,"['Cheers to our Green Heroes grabbing some points tomorrow üíö', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **Aston Martin can celebrate again. Both drivers finished in the top ten, with Fernando Alonso even securing fifth place on the grid. The medium-tire trick was planned well in advance. Mercedes copied it and almost secured pole position.**\n\n> The 2026 season has been a tragedy for Aston Martin so far. Recently, Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll have been consistently stuck in Q1. Stroll has always scored his 14 World Championship points when his rivals have missed them. Alonso\'s points tally is still empty after six World Championship races.\n\n> The first major technical upgrade was intended to halt the downward trend in Imola. After a comparison test on Friday, it was determined that the new aerodynamic package was better. But it wasn\'t so good that it would turn a Q1 car into a Q3 car. Despite this, Alonso and Stroll made it to the final knockout round relatively relaxed, trumping grid positions 5 and 8, respectively. Alonso missed Oscar Piastri\'s best time by 0.761 seconds, however. In the last few races, the green cars were more than a second behind.\n\n> The result flatters Aston Martin somewhat. ""We\'re not as good as the result,"" admits Alonso. Had the Spaniard driven on soft tires like most of his teammates, he would have finished tenth on the grid. The extra boost came from the tire choice. Starting in Q2, Aston Martin opted for the medium tire on each of their second attempts.\n\n> **Medium more stable and less temperature sensitive.**\nThat was the plan from the start. Aston Martin wasn\'t confident about Pirelli\'s new superglue, the C6. ""We already noticed during the tests last year in Mexico and Abu Dhabi that things could get critical with the C6 at the end of the lap on certain tracks,"" reveals chief engineer Mike Krack. But they were a bit hesitant. ""The new soft tire lasted surprisingly long on Friday.""\n\n> Nevertheless, Aston Martin went ahead with its plan. And it was proven right. The C6 was already degrading in the second sector with the track temperature reaching 40 degrees Celsius. The C5 compound, on the other hand, remained stable throughout the entire lap. The medium tire overheats less quickly and also offers more lateral stability because the tread moves less.\n\n> Aston Martin may no longer have any fresh medium tires in its contingent, but the team almost always warms up its tires before races anyway. Alonso believes he\'s well prepared for the race. ""We\'re not as fast as we look. But even if we lose two more positions, it wouldn\'t be a big deal. We just need to manage to make it through the race with one stop. Then the others have to overtake us on the track, and that\'s difficult.""\n\n> **Mercedes almost on pole position.**\nOnly one team also ran a medium in Q3. Mercedes had it in mind, but wasn\'t sure whether to sacrifice a set of C6 tires. Only when Aston Martin showed such a big performance did Mercedes decide to do the same. For the very last attempt, George Russell switched from soft to medium.\n\n> Red Bull team principal Christian Horner admits: ""When we saw that, we were sure George would be on pole position."" And that almost happened. Russell was only 0.137 seconds behind Piastri\'s pole lap. The Englishman lost his time entirely in the first four corners. ""After that, George was exactly as fast as Piastri,"" Mercedes calculated. Russell may have lost pole position on the warm-up lap. He had to slow down in heavy traffic, which is never good for tire preparation.\n\n> **Red Bull has saved medium.**\nRed Bull also briefly considered the medium tire, but preferred the better strategic options in the race. ""If it had guaranteed us pole position, we would have done it,"" says Horner. On the soft tire, Max Verstappn delivered an otherworldly first sector. However, by the second section, the Dutchman was already feeling a loss of grip. The Red Bull understeered more and more as the lap progressed.\n\n> McLaren once again beat Red Bull and Mercedes with its wildcard. The papaya racers keep every tire stable within the window, regardless of the compound. Piastri gained two tenths on Verstappen in the second part of the track. Looking back, Horner is glad he still had fresh medium tires in stock. ""One qualifying lap would have drained too much life out of that set of tires. We would have paid the price in the first stint on Sunday.""', 'Running the medium tire was a great gutsy call', 'Now to actually hold onto it for tomorrow and not drop like a brick of have a stupid strategy.', '![gif](giphy|uycNWzHCdfdcG4MY0q)', 'Alonso wdc 2026 please', 'All week people in F1 were talking about the mediums might be better.

1kp3bws,What rules apply to the medical car?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kp3bws/what_rules_apply_to_the_medical_car/,2025-05-17, Discussion,"Howdy, mods let me know if this kind of post isn‚Äôt meant for here

I had some questions and was curious on other‚Äôs opinions of medical car procedures. 

Firstly, how is driver radio communicated? Everyone seems to know quite quickly a crashed driver is okay or not, I believe Lando was told within a couple seconds after passing tsunoda‚Äôs incident. Does the race engineer do something simple like, stick a thumb up once they hear, and someone from the teams look? I ask because this is relevant to my question about the medical car. 

If I were the physician responsible, I would want to know *exactly* the words spoken by the driver that just shunted. Do they feel hurt, what hurts, what is their general conscious condition?

Secondly, do we know of specific rules that constrain the actions of the medical car? Are they forced to follow the direction of travel in the pits or on track, or can they drive wherever to reach the patient ASAP. 

I ask because a thought came to me after Doohan‚Äôs shunt. 

Consider this nightmarish theoretical:

At Imola, driver has a freak crash at turn 17-18 and immediately triggers the G-force alarm. Safety and med cars deployed as the red flag flys, but the driver comes over the radio saying:

>help help help, I‚Äôm bleeding

Or

>something is wrong I need help now

Would the medical car *really* put a flying lap in around the circuit to get to the driver? That precious two minutes could be critical. Our would/could/should they take a significant risk in rushing down the straight in the opposite direction of traffic to get to the driver? 

Rules may be in place, policies may exist, but if I was the physician responsible, I would**proportionally** react, do what was required to get to the patient who is actively in peril asap. Obviously this risks a lot, especially causing an accident, but that is merely theoretical. Practically, someone is dying

What do you think? How do you think you would act?","['Ok so I‚Äôve sat in race control in the past and worked with the medical team a bit.\n\n1) lots of ways. The second there‚Äôs a crash everyone in race control is watching the cctv and FOM tv coverage desperately hoping to see the driver move and get out, at the same time race control will radio the nearest marshal post and get them to get a visual on the driver and look for and report a thumbs up or driver condition etc.\n\nEveryone is also listening to the team radio, only the FIA desk on race control has that direct team and car radio so 90% of race control can‚Äôt hear that but we do listen to publicly available commentary and radio as well as people at home, but remember that‚Äôs delayed by several seconds. But we still listen to it.\n\nBasically any sign on cameras, radio  and marshals.\n\n\n2) lots of rules and some just conventions. Lap 1 it‚Äôs always following anyway and won‚Äôt ask but just stop at an incident.\n\nOutside that Race control will tell the medical car to move or not.\n\nThe Chief Medical Officer sitting in race control can see the g shock impact alarm and the same tv etc, he‚Äôll be on immediate standby and on the radio to the medical car to get them ready, but they have a tv in the car as well so will have seen a crash on tv usually.\nAt the same time the chief medical officer will be looking at the race director who‚Äôs in contact with everyone and also watching tv, it‚Äôs he who will say go or not and when to the medical car, although technically the CMO can decide themselves but generally everyone runs to the race director or clerk of the course as they‚Äôll also enact flags etc.\n\nNo they won‚Äôt do a full lap, almost every circuit has shortcuts and cut through the car will use. \n\nALL cars travel in race direction at ALL times, the risk of head to head crash is unthinkable so it‚Äôs NEVER done. EVER. It‚Äôs like rule one on track.\n\nYou also have multiple extraction teams around the circuit and all the marshals.\n\nIn your worst case scenario they‚Äôd be activated immediately and at least one extraction team, usually also containing doctors and amazingly skilled at saving drivers lives with a LOT of training would get there, these are spaced around the track to minimise reaction times.\n\nThe medical car would take the shortest route all already practiced and known for every section of track and would also be told to by race control and okd so everyone knows where that car‚Äôs moving and how.\n\nAt the same time the nearest marshals will be reacting and getting out flags, fire suppression and driver support and if the driver is trying to get out themselves they may assist or not depending on the situation.\n\n\nAll of that will happen and be radiod and made to happen within 20-30 seconds from the moment of impact!\n\nAnd occasionally yes, if you‚Äôre in the radio to a marshal who‚Äôs on site and the cameras haven‚Äôt seen it you might be the one who puts a thumb up in race control or speaks a little more loudly and says ‚Äúthumbs up driver all ok‚Äù\n\nAll of the above happens very quietly by the way and very very calmly in 95% of race controls for F1.', '1. They have race control listening in for them. They‚Äôll be told ‚ÄòX says he‚Äôs okay and I can see him getting out of the car‚Äô, ‚ÄòY says he can‚Äôt self extract or feel his left leg‚Äô, ‚ÄòWe haven‚Äôt had any response at all from Z‚Äô via the radio from Race Control.\n\n2. They should go in the direction of the track if possible. They‚Äôre going on a live track with other cars going around with them (even if it‚Äôs the other cars heading to the pits), Marshals hopping out expecting them to be coming one way. Obviously this can be deviated from but it‚Äôs unlikely to be.', 'I don‚Äôt think anyone has said this but the drivers have an ok button on the wheel that they can press, that‚Äôs why after a crash we see a little onboard message saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ok‚Äù with no sound and a few minutes later we hear the actual onboard message with the race engineer.', 'I would assume they act as instructed by race control, same as with other interventions', 'The first rule of helping someone else is always to make sure that you are in a condition to provide that help. It\'s the basic ""put your oxygen mask on, then help others put theirs on"" rule. Hence, you *never* run opposite of traffic. You can\'t help a dude if you die in a wreck on the way to the scene. It also wouldn\'t be terribly helpful to cause a second wreck when there is already one active.\n\nAs a basic example: Think of the barriers. Barriers are set up to protect from one direction. In the opposite direction, they become solid beams of steel just waiting to jump out and kill you when you make a minor driving mistake on the way the existing crash.', 'This is really interesting. Maybe it‚Äôs one you could contact the teams/media with (and then please reply with findings!) \n\nMy guess would be that the race director has some buttons to notify the teams of a crash and that driver has declared himself OK. \n\nIt‚Äôs pure speculation however', '>Firstly, how is driver radio communicated? Everyone seems to know quite quickly a crashed driver is okay or not, I believe Lando was told within a couple seconds after passing tsunoda‚Äôs incident.

In this case Yuki said over the radio that he was okay. They got a response from him. ~~The red bull team is probably able to communicate to the safety team. The car would be deployed as soon as accident was reported but they could get radio in the car giving updates like ""The driver says they are stuck"" or ""the driver is not responding"".~~ The teams cannot communicate directly with the safety team. \n\nIn relation to cameras the safety team could see Yuki get out of the car like we did and could radio to the team in the car ""The driver was able to remove themself from the car, disengage the steering wheel and is walking away from the wreckage"" or ""The driver managed to get out of the car but has collapsed""\n\nAs far as driving the wrong way on the track I\'m not sure but I\'m guessing if cars are still on the track they would not be allowed to do so.

1kp0iox,Question: What happens if they both went out?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kp0iox/question_what_happens_if_they_both_went_out/,2025-05-17, Technical,"In my humble opinion, a big factor with this was Bortoleto staking a claim at the end of the pit lane‚Ä¶ but what if they both went out, or what if Bearman went out first? More specifically: what is the penalty for participating in a qualifying session that a driver did not make?

¬†I scrubbed through the [FIA Sporting Regulations](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2025_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_1_-_2024-07-31.pdf) and the closest answer I could find was in 39.4 section b (page 47 of the PDF), which states:

Drivers will be considered to be ‚Äúunclassified‚Äù in the following circumstances:

i)¬†If they got eliminated in Q1 or SQ1 and their best session lap exceeded 107% of the fastest time set during that session, unless the track was declared wet by the Race Director.

ii) If they failed to set a time in Q1 or SQ1, or if all their laps were deleted

iii) If they got disqualified by the Stewards from the Qualifying session or sprint qualifying session

The relative classification of such drivers will be determined as follows:

\- Drivers who are unclassified because of conditions (i) or (ii) will be allocated the top positions in accordance with the order they were classified in P3 (or, in the case a Sprint Session is scheduled, P1)

\- Drivers who are unclassified because of condition (iii) will be allocated the lower positions in accordance with the order they were classified in P3 (or, in the case a Sprint Session is scheduled, P1)

The participation of unclassified drivers in the remainder of the Competition will be determined in each case by the Stewards, who may exceptionally consider parameters such as:

\- A suitable lap time being set in another practice session

\- The general performance of the driver in previous Competitions of the Championship

\- The gravity of the offence which caused the driver‚Äôs disqualification

¬†It‚Äôs an odd one just from a sporting regulation standpoint. They‚Äôre not going to change the ruling on the field, obviously, but it‚Äôs an interesting thought that I can‚Äôt seem to find a clear answer to other than you would say that Bearman would have been unclassified?

I reckon starting from the back of the grid as ‚Äúunclassified‚Äù but disqualified from the GP? Fine? Not that it mattered, but a grid penalty?

","['I think if Haas had sent Bearman out and the ruling has gone the way it has, it‚Äôd be a big penalty.
