It’s understandable that marketing-focused Brown would be interested in at least exploring the possibility of an Indycar crossover sure to generate interest…Piastri was not a well-known figure at the time, and if marketing in Australia were McLaren’s priority they might as well have stuck with Ricciardo despite his performance. \n\nIt is a little funny, though, that 2 out of 3 2023 rookies were former teammates from outside Europe. both came up in the British karting and single-seater scene. both chosen for F1 seats by German TPs who wouldn’t be in f1 much longer and have BMW, VAG, Sauber, and McLaren on their CVs.\n\n\n> There had been some rumours in the media about AlphaTauri looking for a F1 driver and my name was in the mix…**[Helmut Marko] \nwas open to me driving for them, and asked for the conditions of my McLaren release** … I don’t know what happened in that conversation [between Marko and Brown], but for sure it didn’t help because suddenly Helmut was not interested anymore.\n\nI hope someone someday writes a longform piece detailing all of the options Marko explored for what eventually was de Vries’ AT seat. and how far each one went.', ""Imagine if Zak has to go to court and say he wasn't interested in Piastri."", '""Me too, Alex"" -Otmar, probably', ""I wonder how O'Ward felt, given he was already their driver and probably had similar talks."", ""I'm not going to pretend to know who was more at fault here.

However, we need to find a way to introduce some strategic variance, to the point that there are at least a minimum of 2-3x strategies each weekend that would make actual competitive sense to run in a race that converge at one point.
