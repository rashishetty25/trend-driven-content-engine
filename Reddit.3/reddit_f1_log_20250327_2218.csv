1jl753z,[AMuS] Mercedes solves Antonelli puzzle,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jl753z/amus_mercedes_solves_antonelli_puzzle/,2025-03-27, News,,"[""Driver of the day voters somehow collectively spotted Kimi taking damage I guess \n\nStill the oddest DotD winner I've ever seen"", 'Translation:\n\n> The fact that Andrea Kimi Antonelli was voted Driver of the Race by the fans in Shanghai ultimately came as a bit of a surprise to the driver himself. In terms of pure numbers, the 18-year-old hadn\'t really delivered a particularly outstanding performance. The Italian started in eighth place, and he crossed the finish line in eighth place as well. He was 53.7 seconds behind winner Piastri and 42.6 seconds behind George Russell in the sister car.\n\n> The disqualification of the two Ferraris subsequently pushed the youngster up to sixth place. After the race, the youngster revealed that he had sustained damage to the underbody somewhere, which was affecting his pace. Given this, the Silver Arrows driver\'s performance naturally had to be reassessed. The only question that remained was how and where the underbody was damaged.\n\n> After a detailed analysis of the TV images and an examination of the car, chief engineer Andrew Shovlin provided the solution a few days late: ""Leclerc had hit Lewis\'s right rear wheel. The end plate of his front wing broke off. Kimi saw this, but unfortunately he couldn\'t avoid it because other cars were next to him. He drove over the debris, which flew under the car and damaged the deflectors at the entrance to the underbody.""\n\n> Damage costs two to three tenths.\nThis sensitive area of \u200b\u200bthe car has a significant impact on aerodynamics and, consequently, performance. However, the loss of downforce was difficult to quantify, Shovlin regrets: ""It definitely cost a lot of performance. It would be easier to calculate how much it affected the lap time if we had already completed a few laps. But here it happened on the very first lap, so we can only estimate it. Based on the aerodynamic data, we estimate that the loss of downforce cost two to three tenths per lap.""\n\n> Another problem was that the damage affected only one side of the car. The loss of downforce was particularly noticeable on the rear axle. ""Kimi quickly got on the radio and complained that he had no grip at the rear. As a result, the tires started to slide, they overheated, and lost grip. He struggled with this problem for most of the race. During the pit stop, we were only able to alleviate it slightly with the front wing,"" said Shovlin.\n\n> There\'s more to come from Kimi. \nIn the end, the driver had to somehow deal with it himself: ""When you have that kind of damage to your car, it can result in inconsistent handling. Depending on the corner or wind direction, it\'s sometimes better or worse. The balance shifts in different directions. He really did a good job there. But of course, it was a bit frustrating when you saw his strong pace at the beginning of the weekend. He was battling with the two Ferraris and with Max.""\n\n> Overall, Shovlin gives his young prot√©g√© a glowing review for his start with the factory team: ""He\'s a brilliant fit for our team. It was quite difficult to succeed a driver as successful as Lewis. Everyone here in the team enjoys working with Kimi. And he\'s just having fun. Melbourne was particularly difficult with the rain in the first race. But he adapted well. I think there\'s a lot more to come from Kimi.""', 'So glad to let him play with puzzles.

After finishing in 5th place, Charles Leclerc was disqualified from the final standings due to a weight problem, a costly penalty for Ferrari in the championship race. But while the official reason was linked to a lack of weight under the regulation 800 kg, a new revelation from Fred Vasseur, Ferrari\'s main team, brings to light an additional and rather unusual cause for this disqualification.\n\nLeclerc had done everything right during the race, but once on the scales, Ferrari\'s SF-25 turned out to be slightly under the minimum required weight of 799.4 kg, after removing the two liters of fuel needed for post-race analysis. This missing kilo was enough to disqualify the Monegasque driver. At first glance, this might appear to be a purely mechanical infringement, but it seems there was more to it than that.\n\nRemember the exchange between Leclerc and his race engineer at the Australian Grand Prix? It should already have aroused suspicion: ""Is there a leakage? ... I have a full seat of water, like, full of water!"" What appeared to be an amusing exchange at the time of the race turned out to be the same reason why the single-seater lost weight at the Chinese Grand Prix. Indeed, according to Fred Vasseur, it wasn\'t just tire wear that contributed to the disqualification, but also the loss of a liter of water due to a failure in Charles Leclerc\'s drink supply.\n\n**In an interview with L\'√âquipe newspaper, Fred Vasseur revealed that the situation was far more complex than a simple question of worn tires: ""Charles Leclerc\'s downgrading on Sunday is similar to what happened to Russell last year in Belgium,"" he explained. ""The tires are only part of the explanation... We also lost a liter of water when Charles\' drink supply leaked. Downgrading for weight is always an addition of small factors.""**\n\nFerrari being the limit of all parameters at the Chinese Grand Prix, it was this missing liter of water that played a key role in Leclerc\'s disqualification. A cause which might seem anecdotal, but which, combined with tire wear, cost Ferrari dearly. Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur adds: ""The aim of the game in F1 is to get to the limit of all parameters, everywhere. To get to the last gram of weight, to get to the last tenth of a millimetre of skid, to get to the last millimetre of aileron deformation"". Let\'s hope that this water leak will be definitively repaired for the Japanese Grand Prix.', 'It really was the water. Charles should have listened to those words of wisdom.', 'Must be the water.', 'How does a leak a race before make you underweight the next?', ""Leclerc really is Raikkonen's successor. He has multiple drink system problems every year"", ""We are a serious racing team with rich history...except I can't take these people seriously because wtf?"", 'It‚Äôs a precision sport. If your race engineer tells you the problem is the water, then it must be the water.', 'Well I‚Äôll be damned. It actually was the water.']",39,71,0.85,39,67,67,11,14,-0.010000000000000009,11

1jl06i2,The Alien Trap: Is Red Bull Racing Repeating Repsol Honda's Mistakes with Marquez in MotoGP? [OC],https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jl06i2/the_alien_trap_is_red_bull_racing_repeating/,2025-03-27, Discussion,"For anyone here who follows MotoGP, you know how Marc Marquez dominated in the 2019 season on a bike that other riders complained they couldn't get the best out of. Marc's preference? A bike that is very front-sensitive, allowing him to place it exactly where he wanted it, being fast across all racetracks. Pedrosa, Lorenzo, Espargaro, Crutchlow, Rins, Mir ‚Äî so many riders, most of them multiple world champions, failed on the RC213V and ended their careers. Honda rookies kept failing since 2016 on a bike that was too unforgiving.

While the front-end sensitivity of the bike helped make up for the slight power deficit the RC213V engine had, it also needed the riders to push too heavily on the front end. Making up time in braking was Marc's style, and the bike developed in that direction. Please the golden boy, the blessed alien, and you'll get the most dominant season in 2019. What follows when he injures himself? Disaster for four straight years. Come 2025, Repsol has left MotoGP, Marc Marquez is dominating on the factory Ducati, and Honda has to start fresh. They stay happy with point finishes. Guess Marc's main sponsor? Red Bull.

Does this sound familiar?

Kvyat, Sainz, Gasly, Ricciardo, Albon, Perez, Lawson, and now Tsunoda will step into the highly sensitive and yet slow car that Red Bull's other alien, this one in F1, has mastered. Or has he? Red Bull as a company relies heavily on backing aliens, and right now, there are just two in F1 and MotoGP. Yes, Verstappen can work wonders, but it has a limit. A crap car is a crap car. The world saw what Marc Marquez did on a year-old Ducati. He chose to go into the 2024 season on last year's undeveloped non-factory Ducati and gave the factory riders a run for their money. Who knows? Maybe Verstappen can take a page out of Marc's playbook and try the Racing Bulls car, perhaps. Because the RB21 doesn't seem to be pleasing him too much.

The trap of a team or manufacturer falling into alien-oriented development of their racing machine is far too real and evident in the cases of both Max Verstappen and Marc Marquez. Both teams have sabotaged their driver development programs, and juniors are more scared than ever.

If my theory makes sense, which it does to me, Red Bull Racing is headed for a dark and bleak future, especially with so many seniors, including Newey, departing. Horner and Marko both seem to have developed an arrogant and disrespectful attitude towards others. Guess where else it happened? Alberto Puig at Repsol Honda. I remember talking to a friend in 2021, saying, ""This guy will drown Repsol Honda if things continue like this."" Honda played along the same way they are right now. Forcing a Japanese rider, Hiroshi Aoyama, alongside Marquez. If it isn't working for Red Bull anyway, we might as well push our Japanese guy onto the grid.

To conclude, this combo of Red Bull over-emphasizing on aliens, opinionated boomer management, and Honda's opportunism and rigid values have doomed one team and multiple junior driver careers. It is only a ticking time bomb at Red Bull Racing Honda. I would love to hear your opinions, but with what's happening with Lawson and Tsunoda, it is heartbreaking. Verstappen doesn't seem happy either. Red Bull's decline in F1 has just begun.",[],0,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0
