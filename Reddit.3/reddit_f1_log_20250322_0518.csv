Ferrari's best result was a double podium in Austria 2022, with Leclerc in P2 and Sainz in P3. 

Hamilton and Leclerc have both scored multiple podiums but have never ended on the top step in this format. This will be Hamilton's second time starting a Sprint from pole, after Britain 2021 (finished P2 behind Verstappen). Leclerc also has one Sprint pole to his name, in Azerbaijan 2023 (finished P2 behind Perez).

Sprint Races wins:

11 - Verstappen (Britain 2021. Imola, Austria 2022. Austria, Belgium, COTA, Brazil 2023. China, Miami, Austria, COTA 2024). 

2 - Bottas (Monza, Brazil 2021), Piastri (Qatar 2023 & 2024). 

1 - Russell (Brazil 2022), Perez (Azerbaijan 2023), Norris (Brazil 2024).

Not looking for any money. How can I get these to someone who would appreciate them?

I have years 1998-2001 on tape. Just dug them out of storage. I buy the season review every year and now have 1970-current on DVD.

Back in the day, pre-internet, you had to call Duke Video in England, talk to a live person, and make sure they convert the tape from PAL format to the US-friendly NTSC standard (an extra fee). With shipping they were quite expensive. 

I'd wait weeks for them to arrive, then gleefully pop them into the VCR to enjoy.

1jgqugd,Every current F1 drivers best Quali performance.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jgqugd/every_current_f1_drivers_best_quali_performance/,2025-03-21, Discussion,"In light of today's brilliant qualifying session I started thinking about what each driver on the current grids best qualifying lap is. Here is what I came up with. 

Max Verstappen - 2023 Monaco -
One of the most exciting Q3's in recent times was topped by this extraordinary effort from Max. Two tenths down going into the final sector it looked as thoigh we were getting an Alonso pole and probable win given that it's Monaco. Then Max pulled three tenths out of the bag by going oh so close and even touching some walls that had ruined his Monaco Grand Prix in his early years. 

Liam Lawson - Singapore 2023 - 
Not a massive amount of choices here but this one is great. At this point in the year it was Liams third race in F1 as he subbed in for the injured Danny Ric and he was racing for the Alpha Tauri team that had thus far scired just three points and reached Q3 just twice. Yuki was down in 15th but Liam set a lap that got him into Q3 and would lead him on a path to points. Best of all, it knocked the Red Bulls out as Max was demoted to 11th on the grid after having won 10 races running. 
This lap not only ended that streak but also was when a full time F1 drive became a serious possibility for him. 

Lando Norris - Spain 2024 - 
Lando has a few options as he excels particularly in wet weather Qualis. However it is a lap in Spain's sunny summer that stands out the most. 
It looked unlikely Max would be toppled however Lando managed to grab his first of 8 race poles in  2024 with a brilliant effort. 

Oscar Piastri - Saudi Arabia 2023 -
Yes I could have gone for one of his sprint poles or many front row laps but this lap, where he put his McLaren 8th on the grid is my favourite. 
It was Oscar's second race and his team mate Norris had gone out in Q1 in 19th. His first race in Bahrain had been disappointing as his McLaren has broken down on lap 13. But in one of the worst cars on the grid Oscar did something special under the lights in Jeddah to make Q3 and then put it 9th. Then he was promoted to 8th after Leclerc's penalty, speaking of whom...

Charles Leclerc - Sakhir 2020 -
""What?!"" I can hear you say, ""Leclerc has 26 poles and you have THIS lap as the best?"" 
Well Yes, this was only good enough for 4th on the grid, but he was in a 2020 Ferrari! And Vettel was down in 13th! Admittedly there were quite a few P4s for him that year but this stands out because when he put it in during the first runs it was good enough for second, and he had gone purple in sector one. 
The lap was so good that Charles himself got out of the car without even setting a final run and said it was an amazing lap, and Charles is usually very self critical. 

Lewis Hamilton - Singapore 2018 - 
A very highly rated lap among fans and I came up with a few contenders to beat it (Silverstone 2007, Monaco 2015, Italy 2017 Australia 2018, Styria 2020). However in Singapore 2018, it seemed Merc had only the third fastest car at a track they usually struggled at. Lewis had narrowly avoided elimination in Q2. Then suddenly he produced what Toto Wolff called the best lap he has ever seen in an F1 car as Hamilton went 1.3 seconds faster than any lap he had done so far that weekend. This was where it became evident that Vettel wasn't getting that title. 

Russell - Belgium 2021 - 
Russell's Quali laps in 2021 just keep getting better and better and after a series of Q3 appearances George blew the F1 world away by qualifying 2nd in torrential conditions that had taken out a rapid Norris.
Russell in the 8th/9th fastest car outqualified everyone except Max Verstappen and when Sundays race never started, this lap got George his first ever podium and Williams's only podium of the last 12 years.

Andrea Kimi Antonelli - China 2025 ( sprint Quali) - Yeah theres only two options and the other ones bad so moving on

Fernando Alonso - Britain 2012 - 
What a year this was for Fernando, and the best qualifying lap of his I could think of is here. It was a told turvy wet to dry session and Fernando put his upper midfield at best Ferrari on pole position by 5 hundredths if a second ahead of Mark Webber.

Lance Stroll - Turkey 2020 - 
Yeah this couldnt be anything else and is widely regarded as Lance's finest hour. On a slippery, wet, resurfaced Turkish track Lance Stroll beat Max Verstappen to go give Racing Point it's first pole since Fisichella in 2009 when it was Force India. Lance Stroll was on pole in Istanbul. (That rhymes well) 

Pierre Gasly - Las Vegas 2024 - 
Throughout 2020 and particularly 2021 Pierre Gasly put in some stunning laps but never did one impress me as much as last years third place in Las Vegas. This lap was enough to beat both Red Bulls, both McLarens, Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton. And this is in a year where there was a fairly large gap between the top four amd the rest. 

Jack Doohan - China 2024 (sprint Quali) - 
Yeah only two options for Jack and this one was good as he beat Gasly. It's a shame for him Alpine seem to have been affected worse than anyone by new rear wing rules. 

Esteban Ocon - Monaco 2023 - 
The second time this fantastic qualifying has come up and this Ocon lap for P3 was special. It was the first/second runs in Q3 and you can hear the shock in commentator Alex Jacques voice when this lap puts Ocon onto provisional pole. Incredible effort that earned him a podium on race day. 

Ollie Bearman - Azerbaijan 2024 - 
Honestly today is a contender but this lap is more impressive imo. After a surprise Saudi weekend that I personally didn't rate as highly as most people Bearman was back when Magnussen got banned for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix and after a messy crash in practice Bearman rebounded in stunning style to out qualify Hulkenburg and get into Q3! 

Yuki Tsunoda - Brazil 2024 -
Last weeks lap in Australia is certainly up there but I think last years lap that got him P3 on the grid on a wet and rainy Sunday morning in Brazil is his best. Yuki was incredible last season and this was the cherry on top. He seems to be driving perhaps even better this year. 

Isack Hadjar - Australia 2025 - 
Well out of the two qualifying sessions that he's partaken in being fastest of al the rookies and 11th on the grid is respectable. It will be exciting to see what he can do in the future. 

Alex Albon - Italy 2023 - 
I narrowed it down to Japan 2019 when he matched Max, and Britain, Zandvoort amd Italy 2023. 
Ultimately I went with the highest up of those in Zandvoort when Albon put it P4 on the grid. Brilliant lap in the Williams. 

Carlos Sainz - Italy 2023 - 
Qualifying on pole? in a Ferrari? in Monza?! It doenst get much better than that for a qualifying lap and Sainz sent the tifosi into ecstasy with a supreme lap to top Max Verstappen's effort and put it on pole for the race. 

Nico Hulkeburg - Brazil 2010 - 
Hulkenburg's only pole in F1 and on a drizzly day on track in Interlagos everyone wondered which of the 5 championship contenders would be on pole. 
In the end neither of the Red Bulls took pole, which was unusual in 2010, amd it wasnt a McLaren or even a Ferrari that usurped them. It was a bloody Williams. 
Rookie Hulkenburg was finding out he didn't have a drive for 2011, with Williams bringing in Maldonado for the cash. But Hulkenburg showed he belonged on that grid and set pole position. 

Gabriel Bortoleto - Australia 2025 -
Finally we arrive at Bortoleto's and his two qualifying sessions thus far have been marvellous. However getting into Q2 in Australia and knocking out Antonelli on debut reminded everyone that this Brazilian star of the future has just come off back to back F3 and F2 titles and is his best Quali so far in an F1 car though I imagine that will change many times in the coming years....

I'd be really interested to hear what you all think and what other laps spring to mind from our current grid.

You could maybe squeak the Max-George drama in there, too, but I'm sure they'll cook with that later.

\#9: Azerbaijan 2024, specifically Williams' double points finish. I'm sure they had their hands tied with that race covering the frontrunner drama, but a DOUBLE POINTS FINISH for the team that finished 9th AND had a young driver in his 2nd ever F1 race should have been mentioned. (I get them not covering Bearman in Saudi because his race seat was all but guaranteed, so I bet they played it safe and figured they could give him more depth in Season 8, like they did with George Russell the year after Sakhir 2020.)

\#10: Brazil 2023. Aston Martin making a late push to hang on to 4th in the championship, with some Fernando magic sprinkled on top. C'mon it was a photo finish!! Netflix should eat that shit up

While they enjoy a good relationship, there is likely an element of professional jealousy at play. Russell beat Norris to win the Formula Two championship in 2018.
