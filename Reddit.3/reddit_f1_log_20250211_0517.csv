1imb98k,We are expanding the r/formula1 moderator team. Applications are now open!,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1imb98k/we_are_expanding_the_rformula1_moderator_team/,2025-02-10, Meta,"Hey r/formula1,

It has been a very long time, almost 4 years, since our last round of moderator recruitment. Back then we were only at 1.5 million members. Since then not only has the subreddit tripled in size, but after the 2023 Reddit Blackout multiple members of the mod team had left and since then the rest of us had also come close to being burnt out. So with all that and with an exciting 2025 season on the horizon it's time for a new round of moderator recruitment.

The qualifications to become a moderator are very simple:

* be a motorsports fan
* use reddit

The expectations for the new moderators are to be transparent, to be communicative and to be reasonably active. We have a guideline of 300 mod actions per month, but don't let this stop you from applying. **Real life always comes before Reddit** and just let the rest of the team know if you need a break.

After the form is closed we will evaluate the applications, compile a shortlist and invite those candidates to an interview. The interview will be conducted as an audio or video call. After the interview we will make the final selection of moderators and we hope to be able to onboard them by the Japanese GP at the start of April.

The applications will close on the 22nd of February at 23:00 UTC

[**Link to the application form**](https://forms.gle/gHS5HKHDWNbpJzXs8)

If you have any questions or doubts feel free to ask in the comments.

# FAQ

* **What timezones are you looking for mods from?**
   * We're looking for mods from all timezones
* **What do you use for communication between the team?**
   * Slack
* **Should I apply if I applied in previous rounds?**
   * Yes. It has been 4 years!
* **Do you need to have moderation experience?**
   * No, it's not an issue if you don't have moderator experience yet.
* **What are the tasks of a moderator exactly?**
   * Obviously the primary task is going through the modqueue and removing comments and posts that go against the subreddit rules.

* **Is there any compensation for moderation?**

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY “NEW”.

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

Reported to launch and actually have their ""New"" car for 2025 but with the OLD liveries.

(Which is odd but I doubt they will actually be the full 2025 car)

**O2 Launch on the 18 February:**

All teams, 20 drivers and 10 team principles and all the new livery designs on the 2024 cars. (which will be odd since Williams and HAAS have)  
Teams HAVE TO have their new livery designs on this day.

**After O2 Car Launch (Between 18th Feb and 26th Feb):**

Each team is launching their new car.  
No clear indication these will have the new livery or old. Some are calling their event a ""shake down"".

*(But as we know these will very likely NOT be the new car's. Maybe the new engine and most likely at the very least old wings etc)*

*(And then Red Bull and Ferrari at least will basically have the same livery designs yet again, lol)*

**Testing - 26th, 27th, 28th February:**

Where you will MOSTLY see the new 2025 cars, but not exactly either. Same old silly business where some will do long runs with new engine and old chasis on Day 1 /2 etc and then maybe show off the new new car chassis on day 3.  
Some may show their new car but as a result of testing change a load of it just before Race weekend in Melbourne.

Since its an evolution season from 2024, some may have some more unique things but it is more likely most if not all teams will just have refinements based on what were the best things from 2024 with teams copying what others did etc.

With the launch of Reiss Season 2 Mclaren release (Some stuff looks really cool) one of the jackets has a couple of clear kiwi's on the front.  
Another Jacket I am really keen on. I was talking to my friend about it. Not an F1 fan as long as myself but big fan for over a decade himself.

I said ""Its nice to have the clear representation, the kiwi in the logo is to simple.""   
And he was like ""whaaaat?""  
While he knew Mclaren origins were New Zealand he did not know the shape in the logo was a kiwi. I had to show him the older logo's for him to get it.

So it got me thinking, how many people do not know what that shape was?  
  
**So legit question, how many here did not know the Mclaren logo has a kiwi on it?**","[""I feel like I learned this factoid a long time ago.

It was designed by Raymond Loewy as a gift from\xa0one of the team's sponsors and evokes a chequered flag.  \n\n>1991-1997: As our ambition on the track converged with our\xa0nascent road car division, the three chevrons merged into one, and the font became more modern and sophisticated. The logo may have changed but our cars remained as successful as ever.  \n\n>1997-2006: The revamped logo that first appeared in 1997 featured a streamlined speedmark that bares similarities to the vortices created by our rear wing. It appeared on the top of our cars’ side-pods. They evoke the aggressive markings found on predatory animals and insects.\n\nThough I guess the kiwi logo led directly to the simplification into the chevron logo which it still sorta resembled if you squinted, which later led to the stylization into the speedmark logo."", ""There's a kiwi in that logo?

It gives the impression of a beak and a pair of little kiwi legs.
