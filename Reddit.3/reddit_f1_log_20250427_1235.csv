The newest regulations where a driver has a permanent number and the ability to use number one I believe went into effect in 2014 with Vettel. 

Individuals that I believe did not:
- ~~Damon Hill (moved from Williams)~~
- ~~Jacques Villeneuve (moved teams after winning)~~
- ~~Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen? With Ferrari assigning the number to Filipe Massa instead~~

- Lewis Hamilton chose to stick with #44 *but used it with McLaren*
- *Mansell (retired)*

But you can\'t expect the car on the outside to compromise that much when they\'re going to be forced off track. In that case what Verstappen did at Imola in 2021 was totally fair (it did go unpunished) but was controversial also and to many media pundits ""typical aggressive Verstappen"". \n\nAlso I don\'t want the cars on the outside just go off track and either risk the penalty or give the place back. Overtaking should be done on track, not in the stewarding room.', 'I get that the drivers feel you can run someone wide if you‚Äôre on the inside, but what happened to leaving space for racing? There‚Äôs no extended battles anymore, just a divebomb, a driver off the track, and that‚Äôs it. I understand that the tracks are smaller and it‚Äôs more difficult, but Oscar simply could not have made his Jeddah move at say Baku. Max would‚Äôve been in a wall so his only option is to damn near stop on track and let the overtake happen. Can drivers defend the inside line every time and just run their car to the opposite white lines? I‚Äôm not saying I disagree with how Jeddah was handled, but I‚Äôd love to see some rules that actually encourage racing.', ""Doesn't change anything, but it does clarify things for lots of you smoothbrains who don't understand how to draw a radius. Side by side on the straight is not side by side once they enter the turn and never has been. You are only entitled to space around the outside if you can get well ahead on the straight."", ""I mean that was such a blatant penalty that I'm pretty confident that he would have been flagged in any era, especially after the technology existed for video review.  Max barely even turned the car to the left at all on that chicane."", 'what about overtaking on the outside? at some point a defending car will be committed to a line and may not be able to just go tighter to give room so what happens then? \n\nand how is attacker/defender defined - off the line they were both pretty much neck and neck approaching the corner? is that by default assumed the car on the inside is the attacker?']",31,61,0.71,31,55,55,31,61,0.71,31

However I do still see a remarkable number of people espousing the view that Prost merely got lucky that Mansell had his blowout in Adelaide, or that Williams subsequently called Piquet into the pits for a precautionary stop at that same race. By going into the season race-by-race in this article, I hope to highlight that Prost's triumph was not merely the product of luck, but rather one of the greatest sustained campaigns in Formula 1 history, and perhaps even a template for today's drivers on how to clinch a title against the odds..."", 'I guess this is a good time as any to ask this: Am I crazy or was the French calling him the teacher?

His style and approach is the one that everyone adopts now. He was always optimizing for race results, effectiveness over flashiness.

The combination of Schumacher ahaving been a development driver, Toto as exec, Lauda applying his knowledge in all areas... It was an amazing team with or without Hamilton. I don't know who they would have gotten for the second seat. But it almost doesn't matter. As Rosberg and Bottas help demonstrate.\n\n\nNow if Renault hadn't failed Red Bull, so Seb and Danny had a competitive engine. That's a puzzle.\xa0"", 'Massa was pretty poor in the wet if you count him as an elite driver.', 'This is a toxic myth. Prost didn\'t like the wet for safety reasons. After Peroni ran into him kinda sorta forcing Peroni\'s retirement in 1982. Although Peroni nearly won the championship anyway.\n\n\nAlmost no top drivers are poor in the wet. Back when safety was worse, more drivers would refuse to risk their lives in the wet. Today we respect their courage to say no.\xa0\n\n\nThe few drivers who shine in wet conditions usually do so with a mix of skill and bravery.\xa0\n\n\nAlbon had some hero wet qualifying. Not because he\'s a wet master. But because pre-Vowles Williams could risk parc ferme wet setup despite a forecast dry race to do a ""glory run"" and get their junk car on TV for once.\n\n\nVanishingly few drivers are truly that much better or worse than average in the wet. Like people say Hamilton is amazing in the wet. He\'s statistically the best driver in the history of the sport in basically any statistic you pick. Wet is somewhere in the pile of other things he\'s the best at.\xa0', ""Vettel had his struggles in the wet (inb4 Monza 2008, a swift doesn't bring sping, as some say)."", 'Please adress the goat properly as goatify.', 'Latifi\n\nReasons\xa0\n\nDespite the Williams being the worst car in 2020 Goatifi still got the teams best result with not one, not two, but THREE P11 finishes! In Austria, Monza and Imola. His more experienced team mate Russell‚Äôs only had ONE P11 for Williams that year.\xa0\n\nIn 2021 Latifi stepped up again and in Hunagry had the best opening lap of the last decade (possibly longer I genuinely am not sure if theres been a better first lap this century in terms of positions gained) \xa0where he went from P18 to P6 on the first lap!!! That‚Äôs 12 positions gained.\xa0\n\nYou thought Leclerc gaining 11 positions in Abu Dhabi lap 1 was impressive, pfff those are rookie numbers.\xa0\n\nThen in Hunagry 2021 Latifi continued his charge by getting up to P3 by lap 5 and amd holding off the likes of Sainz in Ferrari for 20 laps before he pitted. Obviously his car held him back but he still grabbed a P7 finish ahead of Russell and then got a P9 in the next race.\xa0\n\nIn 2022 we have to remember that as Senna said the only thing that equalises the drivers is the rain.\xa0\nTherefore the only representative sessions are Hungary FP3, Quali and the race in Imola, the race in Japan, practice and Quali in Canada, the race in Monaco, the race in Singapore and Quali in Brazil.\xa0\n\nHowever some of these are obviously not representative. Quali and the race in Imola as well as Quali in Brazil were sprint weekends with little practice time amd therefore do not count.\xa0\n\nPractice and Quali in Canada are unfair on Latifi because that was his home race and there were far too many unfair distractions for him. Amd the races in Momaco and Singapore do not count because the start was delayed and therefore the truly great drivers could not chanel their true powers. This is why Max and Lewis also struggled in those races lile Latifi.\xa0\n\nTherefore the only truly representative sessions all season were Fp3 in Hunagry and the race in Japan.\xa0\n\nIn FP3 in Hungary Latifi was fastest of everyone and a deserving P1. This shows what can happen in a truly representative session.\xa0\n\nThe race in Japan is the only other representative session and though Latifi had the worst car on the whole grid he managed to drive an inspired race to P9, the best he could‚Äôve done.\xa0\n\nSo, this is why Latifi is genuinely the greatest of all time.\xa0\n\nKind regards\xa0\n\nNicholas Latifi‚Äôs Lawyer.', 'But who do you think would have won the last few years?']",0,15,0.44,0,14,14,0,8,0.06,0
