The qualifying format was switched to single-lap runs, which exposed Ferrari’s weakness with tire warm-up and limited Schumacher’s usual strategy of starting heavier on fuel. The points system was also revised to keep the championship battle closer for longer. Things got so extreme after 2002 that Mosley even floated ideas like adding ballast to the championship-winning car or reversing the starting grid.\n\nThe real turning point for Ferrari came with the one-tire rule in 2005. It was no secret that Bridgestones degraded faster than Michelins, and the regulation change effectively swung the advantage toward Micheli supplied teams.

As far as I know Red Bull was losing top roles left and right, and even highly experienced and tenured mid level roles.\n\nI can’t see a real upside to anybody but maybe a desperate WEC GT team hiring him.\n\nThat said, F1 is also a wealthy old boys club, so there could be an aspect of “boys will be boys” after he’s rehabbed his image a bit.
