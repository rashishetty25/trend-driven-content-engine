1nak7iq,Why did Mercedes reveal the DAS system in 2020 instead of 2021?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nak7iq/why_did_mercedes_reveal_the_das_system_in_2020/,2025-09-07, Discussion,"I still don't understand to this day why Mercedes decided to reveal DAS during the 2020 pre-season test. We know today that the Mercedes W11 of 2020 is the most dominant, even the fastest car of all time. They essentially had both the WDC and WCC wrapped up weeks before the teams even headed to Melbourne for the season opener and based on pre-season tests like 2023, teams are highly aware when one team has a dominant car aka the Red Bull so Mercedes of all teams should've also been aware of the gap their 2020 challenger had over the competition.


Moreover, we know also from previous testimony from ex-Mercedes members like Paddy Lowe that in 2014, they deliberately ran low engine modes to hide their enormous gap they built in the new regulations to slow the FIA down from allowing the regulations to let the other teams catch-up.


This begs the question - why didn't they save DAS for the 2021 season? It's of course easier to say with hindsight after COVID happened and the 7 straight years of Mercedes dominance since 2014 that nobody expected Red Bull to produce a title challenger for 2021. Nevertheless, considering Lewis and Max were literally on equal points going into Abu Dhabi in 2021, DAS could've easily been the difference between Lewis winning the WDC and not had it not been banned for the 2021 season which Mercedes facilitated by revealing it in 2020.","[""Sry i stole the Crystal ball from Mercedes in late 2019\n\nThey simply couldn't have known they would be so dominant in 2020 and not 2021 without it."", 'Wasn’t 2020 supposed to be the last year of the regulations? They then got pushed a year after Covid, which they would not have known during the pre season test', '""Why didn\'t Mercedes simply anticipate the new regulations being delayed by a year as a result of an unforeseen pandemic?""', 'Covid postponed the new regulations', 'because the 2022 regulations were meant for 2021', 'Everyone thought that 2020 would be the last year of those regulations and 2021 would bring in the regulations we have now, then Covid happened and the current regulations were pushed back a year to 2022.', '2020 was scheduled to be the last year of those regs. 2021 was a bonus year with those regs.', 'DAS wasnt some sort of magic silver bullet, pretty much everyone was saying it wasnt actually doing much\n\nThey probably did it as a red herring hoping FIA will ban that and not touch anything else, but that didnt happen', ""I might be wrong, but wasn't DAS already getting banned for 21 even if Mercedes didn't use it?""]",0,29,0.22,0,27,27,0,2,-0.010000000000000009,0
