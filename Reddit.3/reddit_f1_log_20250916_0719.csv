You know, there’s a big regulations change next year. We don’t know how competitive we’re going to be, we don’t know how competitive anyone’s going to be. **But you know, ultimately, we want the best chance of winning championships for as long as we’re Formula 1 drivers, and we’re both at McLaren for a very long time.

You know, it’s not a very nice feeling, I would imagine. **So it’s important to protect all the people that we have because that’s what gives us a championship hope for years to come.** \n\n*Lando*: That was beautiful.

That’s how it works.** Normally when you see teams who don’t have some sort of, enough respect for the team and the opportunities that the team give, it normally doesn’t last long. And you see that with plenty of other teams whether it’s been Red Bull, Ferrari, Mercedes. And we want to try and be in this position for a longer period of time than what they have been at the top.
