What he’s doing in that car is special.', 'Was he ever out of it? The Red Bull likes high speed front limited tracks. I’m expecting him to be somewhere in midfield in Monaco.', 'Translation and full article:\n\n> **Max Verstappen turned the tide in the World Championship battle with his second win of the season at Imola. How did he manage that? In our race analysis, we answer the most important questions about the Emilia Romagna GP.**\n\n> **Why was Red Bull so good?**\nAfter dominating the Miami race, McLaren had to concede defeat to Red Bull in the seventh race of the season. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri finished second and third, respectively, behind Max Verstappen, who controlled the entire race. Verstappen once again laid the foundation with his brilliant overtaking maneuver in the Villeneuve chicane. Overall, however, Red Bull also had the better pace than McLaren and was clearly the stronger force. This put them back in the fight for the World Championship.\n\n> Red Bull was on par with its arch-rivals in the 400th Grand Prix in precisely the discipline where McLaren usually excels – tire wear. Despite the warm temperatures, they managed to keep their tires alive. Another bonus: Like in Suzuka, they were in the lead and had a clear path and clean air. The pit stop just in time for the Virtual Safety Car, which was deployed due to Esteban Ocon\'s stranded Haas, played into the Bulls\' hands.\n\n> But even afterward, it became clear: Verstappen had everything under control. He extended his lead to 18 seconds before the safety car neutralized the race due to Kimi Antonelli\'s damaged Mercedes. In other words, he controlled the race from start to finish. ""He was never under pressure,"" said Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. After the safety car, he opened up a lead of 6.1 seconds over ten laps.\n\n> This strength is primarily due to the car being brought into a better setup window. This also allows for better tire temperature management. This is partly due to the upgrades that have been made to the RB21 since Miami. These included a different underbody, and in Imola, a different cooling intake and new brake ventilation.\n\n> Although Friday didn\'t look so promising, Horner reports that Verstappen was happy after the third practice session on Saturday. A typical picture of the difficult Friday – but they still needed time to evaluate and understand all the data. Horner even went so far as to say that they were at the same level as last year in Brazil. After all, Verstappen crossed the finish line 6.1 seconds ahead of Norris and 12.9 seconds ahead of Piastri.\n\n> Horner finds the current development very encouraging. ""We\'re building momentum, which is very important at this stage of the championship."" Verstappen is now third in the World Championship, just 22 points behind Piastri. McLaren team principal Andrea Stella sees two reasons why Red Bull was superior. ""They\'ve improved and made progress,"" he says. He was almost certain that the dominance they showed in Miami wouldn\'t be replicated to the same extent in Imola. ""The type of corners here are completely different from those in Miami. Here we have more fast corners.""\n\n> **Did McLaren expect the strategy with Oscar Piastri?**\nHowever, the question also arose as to whether there might have been more to gain if the McLaren command post had chosen Piastri to pursue a different strategy. The Australian and current World Championship leader made his first pit stop on lap 13 and switched from medium to hard tires. In doing so, he followed the example of Charles Leclerc in the Ferrari, who was the first of the leading group to adopt this tactic.\n\n> Piastri dropped from second to twelfth place, but then had to plow his way through the field. By lap 28, he was back in fourth place. But then came a gift for all those who hadn\'t yet stopped – including Verstappen: the Virtual Safety Car deployed due to Esteban Ocon\'s stranded Haas. Piastri also used the opportunity to switch back to medium. At his second opportunity, when the Safety Car was deployed on lap 46 for Kimi Antonelli, he stayed on the track and was later unable to defend himself against teammate Norris with the older tires.\n\n> ""It was unclear before the race whether it would be one or two stops,"" said McLaren team principal Andrea Stella after the race. ""And when Oscar came into the pits, that was exactly the moment to decide."" In his opinion, the problem was more that the hard tires didn\'t perform much better than the old medium tires. ""If that had been better, the two-stop strategy would have been a very good one – even if he would have had to overtake a few drivers,"" Stella said. ""That\'s why we have no regrets.""\n\n(1/2)', 'He never left.', ""Excellent share and translation, thank you.\n\nRedBull's aero and brake cooling upgrades helped, but Max perfectly positioning himself to take the outside of T1, to get clean air, was his masterstroke."", '“I never left.”', ""All depends, right now the McLaren works at every track.

We also get the McLaren drivers imitating Andrea Stella who apparently reminisces a lot about the Schumacher era in Ferrari. Extra amusing because George is way more chill here than in Australia.\n\n2) Bahrain GP - We start out strong with a light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek, self-deprecating comment from Lando, immediately followed by a  half-naked George Russell. We have Oscar poking fun at Lando. Lots of jokes from Lando about himself. George becomes Lando\'s sympathetic hype man. Should probably be switched around with China but gets extra points for George being on brand and shirtless.\n\n1) Australian GP - Lando\'s mum\'s swearing being part of the highlights makes up for the slightly awkward vibes between Max and George (and their mutual friend Lando who is thankfully in the middle).

Strong as hell qualifying and a formidable race. A lot could have gone differently, most notably Sainz pitting right before the VSC was thrown into the mix.

You can’t allow pushing someone off, allowing other cars through (especially the offenders teammate) but it’s all good because you gave the place back a few laps later. \n\nThe switch to even softer compounds did lead to some interesting mixups in both qualifying (some on mediums) and the race (mediums dying a bit in the middle of a stint, so some pitted mixing up strategies).

This was obscured somewhat by the safety cars, but tire wear presented every team with interesting dilemmas, and the difficulty of the choice was highlighted by how many teams chose different strategies, or split strategies between their drivers. 

Pit stops at Imola are unusually costly, but Pirelli had tire compounds where it was difficult to decide between a one-stop and a two-stop strategy. At first it seemed like the undercut would be massively powerful, only for the mediums to come back. But as the stint went on, Albon (on a one stop) started warning the team they were taking a big risk by running those tires so long, though he was delivered by a timely safety car.
