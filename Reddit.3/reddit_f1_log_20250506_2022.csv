Now if we just leave out the most obvious unclean laps (3 of them above)

Doohan wins 9 laps with average gap of .183
Gasly wins 8 laps with average gap of .238


I think this shows his potential, he was also on for P8 in Bahrain if not for tyre strategy.

It was Doohan's mistake not to close the DRS but, having only done the same thing he did in the simulator and not been explicitly told at any point to do anything different, he was known to feel that there was a degree of responsibility on the team's side."", ""Doohan was workable, not saying he was the next anybody, but he wasn't getting dropped mid-season if they didn't have Colapinto.\n\nI can't blame him for being upset, even if I don't think he would have had long-term success in F1, I don't think he had the opportunity to prove it either way, and he shouldn't have had the pressure he had considering he's at Alpine in a year they aren't focussing on"", 'Probably a bad take but drivers like Bearman, Colapinto and Hadjar kind of sealed Doohans fate. They came in an immediately showed something even if it wasn‚Äôt really expected of them. \nF1 is so competitive and tight these days that teams can‚Äôt really afford to keep a driver who may or may not become good over time. Sure Doohan may become really good (he arguably should be decent considering his testing programme) but really in 6/7 races can it be said he‚Äôs been anything other than underwhelming? (even factoring in the fact the cars a tractor). I don‚Äôt expect Colapinto to set the world alight but he compared well to Albon (who is having a season right now). If he eliminates the crashes (which might reduce as his future is secure) he‚Äôll be serviceable. Just avoid Alpines socials for the time being‚Ä¶.', "">But it would do Colapinto a disservice - and be a naive assessment of Doohan's start to 2025 - to pretend there is no competitive element to this at all. [...] At worst, Colapinto may be a crash risk, and may not be a superstar in the making - the sample set of a part-season at Williams is too small to know for sure on both counts - but he is a proven point scorer already and is a driver with ability.\n\nThis is something that I really agree with. Yea, Doohan was dealt an unfair and terrible hand, but it's not as if Colapinto was out of reach to Albon as a rookie with little preparation last year. I think everyone can agree, especially with his performance so far this season, that Albon is a fantastic driver.\n\nColapinto crashed a lot, but most importantly he had the pace. I believe that people just don't like the idea of him on the grid because he brings with him *very* annoying people.\n\nUltimately, this is another self-inflicted gunshot in the driver management side of things for Alpine. There was no need to announce Doohan that early last season, and they wasted 6 races on a driver that they gave one of the worst possible conditions to debut on."", ""I mean when the team hires your replacement before the season has even started you know you're in trouble. How can you have confidence you'll be given the time to learn and improve when the team does that. There's the normal F1 ruthlessness and there's being set up to fail."", ""I've been watching F2/F3 since it was GP2/GP3 when Rosberg won the GP2 title, and I never thought Doohan was anywhere near as bad as a lot of people here think he is.\n\nHe was actually pretty rapid once his junior teams found a good setup for him. Comparing Doohan to other drivers of his age is interesting. Colapinto finished 4th in his second F3 season with just two 2 sprint wins, whereas Doohan finished 2nd in his second season with 3 feature race wins and 1 sprint win. Their first F2 seasons are hard to compare with Colapinto getting called up to Williams before it  finished.\n\nDoohan's second season of F2 would probably have been a championship winning season if not for the setup/chassis issues (depending on who you believe) Doohan experienced in the first half of the season. He outscored the entire grid in the second half of the season to finish runner up to a highly rated Th√©o Pourchaire, who at that point was into his 4th F2 season.\n\nDoohan conclusively (imo) had a better F3/F2 junior career compared to Liam Lawson. Doohan only finished 21 points behind Lawson in F2 despite it being Lawson's second season compared to Doohan's first.\n\nF2 and F3 is littered with drivers who should have had F1 careers, so Doohan can count himself somewhat lucky regardless, but I think a lot of people have passed judgement on his speed without actually watching any of his junior career. The guy was genuinely rapid imo and might have flourished in a much lower pressure environment compared to the basket case that is Alpine. He came into the sport against one of the most in form drivers on the grid and actually managed to outqualify him in Miami, his most recent qualifying session.\n\nThis is all my opinion of course, it's no more or less valid than anyone elses."", 'Is *The Race*‚Äôs editor on vacation?

Now that the dust has settled in Miami, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will not be deleted since I do not have that power, but I will be very disappointed with you. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","[""The RB21 performance varies so much from track to track it's insane... Max was on par and maybe even faster than Piastri in Saudi and here he was 8 tenths slower."", ""I am as disheartened as everybody else to see Ferrari going back into the disorganised, lost figures of themselves in the team, but in my opinion, demanding for Fred Vasseur's exit from the team is simply absurd\n\nDating back to when Luca Di Montezemolo destabilized the Holy Trinity of Ferrari itself, it seems that the team is unable to find middle ground with their values and the prospects to win on certain aspects in a cultural sense. Whether it is the unwillingness to break out of traditional norms to take risks in exchange for chances of winning or the organisation of the fold crumbling under pressure, changing team principals on a constant basis will not solve the problem at hand, especially since Vasseur was the man who narrowly led Ferrari to the top, had it not been for the middle stretch of the races. There is a case to be made with Binotto, but constantly being in the cycle of  shifting, blaming and replacing would only send the organisation back to square one, and fumbling over themselves\n\nThat being said, I also believe Vasseur needs to iron these issues out if Ferrari wants to salvage the rest of their season. Miscommunication between drivers and engineers are not the most unheard of, but for it to be a recurring theme is insane. Neither Leclerc nor Hamilton had adequate pace to catch Antonelli, and they barely kept Sainz at bay in a car believed to be much weaker than theirs. The issue that the drivers are figuring out the car's strengths and weaknesses, and trying to salvage what they can with its characteristics is concerning at this stage of the season. By changing the car's philosophy *(which I get the reasoning but I wouldn't have particularly been on board with)*, the gamble did not pay off well\n\nWith the race where they can bring upgrades coming in, I hope they find something. If that doesn't work, then I can only hope Vasseur would use the time and his efforts to fix the team. It will not be easy, if my understanding of Ferrari's rigid rules are factual, but if the team wants to win, then the bigwigs really need to consider these aspects first before anything. A lot of Ferrari's future is on them"", 'From my second time attending this race (or any F1 event) in person:\n\n1) Turn 18 is a better spot to sit than turn 12. Glad I tried something different this time but I‚Äôd do another spot before sitting at the ‚Äòbeach‚Äô in Miami again. \n2) But, my vantage point made the gap in the field even more outstanding in the last third of the race where Lando and Oscar would come around 11, 12 and 13 and disappear and their sound would disappear. Like‚Ä¶ quiet on the track except for piped in commentary. Then came George and his sound would lessen and then Max and his engine noise dissipated and then‚Ä¶ everyone else. The McLarens were just in a different universe. \n3) I recognize Max as an incredible talent and I‚Äôm a big Lewis fan but I also like having many winners and contenders so I think this year has been fun. I‚Äôll be just as bored if McLaren walks away with all the wins  this year (could be likely!) than I would be if Max did it again or if we were in the Lewis/Merc dominant era . So, I like the dominance shifting and the fun that brings to us, the fans. \n4) Last for me was seeing Albon punching in the top third and every time I saw him go by I was impressed with his chasing of Max and then Ferrari. I like him and I particularly like Vowles and so I think it‚Äôs super cool to see Williams showing a spark and have a resurgence.', ""With the rumours of Doohan possibly getting replaced I can't help but feel sad for him.

It feels incredibly unfair towards the rookies."", 'Interesting race that would have become a melee if it had actually rained.\n\nOscar seems to have better wheel to wheel racing instincts than Lando while Lando seems to optimize lap time in clear air better than Oscar. Looks like this year is going to be a battle between which teammate can learn the others skills more quickly in order to grab the WDC.\n\nFerrari remain a baffling mix of good and bad things. Their car needs development and strategy department needs a full overhaul. The pit crew is really good though.\n\nRed Bull, Merc and Williams seem to be the ones vying for the second best car at the moment. Maybe one or more will find an upgrade that will allow them to take the fight to McLaren.\n\nDirty air seems to still be a very big issue for following cars, lots of drivers complaining about it on radio.I doubt it will get any better this year, hopefully next year with the new regs there will be noticeable improvement in this area.', 'Someone should host a barbeque next to the circuit next time. Guaranteed rain then.', ""I don't know, if people have noticed this, but RB was extremely unlucky with the first VSC during the race.

Not that much better, but every point counts."", 'This is the first time watching Miami that I came away really impressed with the track. I love that you mostly had to use the long straight to force the car to defend and take a weird line into the chicane, and then have to nail those corners to get the chance to overtake into Turn 1.\n\nIt made the overtakes difficult and you had to work for them, but possible. It also made a great viewing experience to watch how the end of the long straight goes to see how far the leading car has to defend offline, and builds your anticipation for Turn 1.\n\nThe race settled down quite a bit after the VSC as the cars were mostly sorted in order of performance, but the Lando/Piastri/Verstappen battles was probably my favourite part of this season so far.', 'I think the reason Oscar was able to force a mistake from Max is that he has a proven history of being able to make a move stick around the outside.\n\nOscar has shown he can hang it around the outside on multiple occasions, so if Max defends the inside line into the corner he also has to go deep, allowing Oscar to switchback.\n\nLando kept taking the outside line but he won‚Äôt get the move done on the outside, which Max also knows. Lando kept trying the switchback instead of going outside so Max didn‚Äôt have to brake so hard and was able to carry more speed through the corner and keep the position.\n\nLando really needs to try something new when battling Max because it‚Äôs just so predictable and Max is completely in his head.', 'Pretty good race,more tyre wear and a second stop or a full safety car would have made it better obviously .\n\nBut the Mclaren pace is downright insane.Multiple VSC and losing time to Max for 10 laps each...and still ending the race 30 seconds ahead of third place is pure dominance.']",29,98,0.86,29,93,93,4,10,0.0,4

1kgbuhw,Are the current overtaking rules flawed?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kgbuhw/are_the_current_overtaking_rules_flawed/,2025-05-06, Discussion,"Hi all.

I'm just after some opinions. I'm not trying to accuse or defend any drivers, rather just trying to grasp the right or wrongs regarding the rules surrounding overtaking we currently see F1 drivers governed by.

I'm not sure exactly when it was officially part of the rules, but at some point it seems whoever is ahead at the apex of a corner is deemed to have the right to run the other driver out of road.

Watching F1 as my primary interest full time since 1996, and part time prior to that, well in years gone by when painted tarmac run-offs we see now instead had grass and gravel traps so if a driver was pushed off the circuit for example they'd often lose bodywork if not retire from becoming beached. Obviously these days, drivers have no such worries and can just run off the circuit and rejoin immediately behind the defending driver and line up another attack.

The issue I have with the current rules is, as mentioned before, you can just throw the car at the apex at any speed and as long as you get there first then screw the other car and leaving a cars width space. Often the car going for the apex barely makes the corner, sometimes they don't at all, as they are going far too quickly. I like hard defending, I hate seeing drivers just letting other cars go past because ""it'll cost them more in racetime"" if they fight, even if it makes sense.

My opinion is that the current rules of engagement are just flawed. I think the car on the outside, if they are far enough alongside the inside car, should be entitled to space. Otherwise it is pretty much impossible to overtake and battle by taking the outside line, for the inside car will just launch themselves at the apex and the resulting momentum will push the car on the outside off the circuit, or they'll crash unless they take avoiding action.

Let me ask another question. Let's say the car on the outside doesn't jump out of the way and there's a crash, taking both drivers out of the race. Who's fault is it? Is it the defending car on the inside who launches the car at the apex, getting there first, but is going too quick to leave the outside car space, or is it the car attempting an overtake around the outside, either ahead going in to the corner or almost fully alongside, going at a reasonable speed to make the corner but ultimately not getting to the apex first?","['Yes they are', ""Current rules are absolutely fucked.\n\nThe only racing series I know of that actively encourages running people off the road.\n\nThe current rules all but guarantee we won't get side by side racing unless 2 drivers are willing to give more than required.\n\nIf there is significant overlap entering a corner then you should be required to leave space for the other car.\n\nIt worked for years and wasn't 9verly complex, then they tried to over regulate every aspect and it made it a farce."", 'not again...  \nI agree with the fact that the rules need updating, but man this gets boring', 'Can we ban this shit posts finally? I see them EVERY SINGLE DAY by now.', '""My opinion is that the current rules of engagement are just flawed. I think the car on the outside, if they are far enough alongside the inside car, should be entitled to space.\xa0""\n\nYes, that is what the current rules say. But no one agrees on what ""far enough"" means. You\'re not exactly plowing new ground here.', 'Yes but the actual issue is that overtaking attempts tend to deplete your tyre budget incredibly fast, so it\'s extremely effective to drive as ""dirty"" as you can (even if the dirty part is okay by current rules)', 'We have these posts everytime Max fucks someone up or someone fucks Max up. It‚Äôs exhausting. They changed the rules they‚Äôre not good but the previous rules weren‚Äôt either so it‚Äôs stalemate.', ""the driver on the outside IS entitled to be given racing room under certain conditions, and if you just sent it down the inside without a care in the world you'd get penalized, but, like everything in F1, drivers (ehem, lewis hamilton AD21, ehem, max verstappen fucking constantly but namely austria 2024 and jeddah 2025) learned to abuse this rule, and when they were caught out by a driver attacking down the inside, they'd just keep their foot in, knowing they would never make the corner, to try and claim that they deserved racing room and that they were pushed wide\n\nit worked a couple of times, but after austria last year the stewards really started catching on and don't allow doing that anymore"", 'Yes, the current rules are flawed, however, I will not criticise a driver who plays within the rules. F1 is a sport of milliseconds and the slightest incremental advantage. The drivers would be moronic to shirk those in place of being purist to what the fans say they ‚Äúwant‚Äù. The drivers also help inform how the rules of engagement should be written. The current rules are too complex with varying rules for slight changes in context and do not encourage ongoing wheel to wheel racing that I enjoyed in the past. The excitement or intrigue is now about whose administrative complaint will be upheld instead of who took track position.']",0,21,0.33,0,16,16,0,5,0.09000000000000002,0

But I'm guessing they don't want two older dropped drivers, it might give off a retirement home vibe.""]",0,67,0.34,0,65,65,0,6,0.020000000000000018,0
