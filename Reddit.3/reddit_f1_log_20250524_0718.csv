Rough break from Ollie, here.', 'Safety issues are safety issues. I do find it hard to judge when exactly the red flag is deployed tho. Not alot of light panels around but the panel in the distance is already red when he turns the corner. \n\nThe steering wheel will also display a red flag but I can’t see if the message is on there before the light panel comes into frame. \n\nGoing to be a tough one for him but I feel he could have gotten away with it if he explained his actions to the stewards using different words.', 'Where is the red flag? I see a white actual flag and a white flashing screen. Maybe a red light at the very end of the clip.', 'Idk why people think this penalty extremely harsh. These are pretty standard when it comes to compromise of safety. Not very long ago Norris was given a 10 second stop and go in Qatar(?) for failing to lift under yellow.', 'I know procedure is procedure, but that is incredibly harsh. I understand why he said what he said to the stewards.', 'Seems completely absurd to give a 10 place grid penalty for this? \n\nSeems like he responded quickly but just a lot of pace difference.', 'Sky sports said the normal procedure for overtake under red flag is 5 place drop before the result was out, idk if that’s true or not, definitely seems harsh if they went above the normal procedure.\n\nI can’t really tell how much warning Ollie had or how easy it would have been to slow to give an opinion on whether the decision was right, but my overall opinion on red flags and safety issues is that they should be taken harshly.\n\nBut that being said, I think it’s hard to have a clear rule when these circumstances are all different. For example i definitely think that the Brazil second formation lap not being punished harshly was very dumb. To me, not only did it technically provide a possible sporting advantage but was definitely a safety issue, with cars going around a track in the wet with personnel on it who weren’t expecting drivers.\n\nEspecially considering a driver crashed on the formation lap.\n\nWhen it comes to red flag procedure, drivers should be punished harshly no matter the session. It is a safety issue, not a sporting advantage issue. However when it comes to these things, I think it’s important to note whether the driver did the safest things in the moment. IDK if it was Baku where something happened with Charles not slowing for double waved yellows in Free practice but Charles saw Pierre go down the escape route and was right at the corner. To do anything but brake as normal would’ve been far more dangerous.\n\nI have to wonder, would it be more dangerous for Ollie to brake harshly here to avoid overtaking? I think it’s very important for drivers to react in the moment what’s safest, rather than think about the guidelines. A major difference between the two incidents though is Charles was reacting to the hazard and knew exactly what he was dealing with it. With a red flag, Ollie had no idea if the hazard was right around the corner or the other side of the track.\n\nWhen it comes to safety though, it is hard to believe that it was 10x more dangerous for Ollie to finish the overtake and have slowed to red flag speeds before he completed the corner than it was for Lance at slow speeds to swing out in front of a car on a fast lap, directly leading to a collision.', 'Maybe he could have slammed on the brakes to avoid overtaking Sainz, but would that have been safer? What if he locks up and hits Carlos? Idk, to me that is incredibly harsh.', 'How soon into the clip was the red flag deployed? Im curious why he seemingly waited so long.', 'Well, what was the color of the flag the marshal was signaling? Was it red? If it was, he had enough time to slow down, he even accelerated after the marshal post.\n\nBut looking at the dash, he slowed down just as the flag was shown, didn’t he?\n\n\nThere was a case a few years ago where Lando overtook under a red flag a few years ago, but the stewards concluded that he had done enough, he was going very fast and simply couldn’t stop before passing the other car.']",185,111,0.95,185,948,948,5,3,0.0,5

How do they re-build street circuits year after after with such accuracy that they manage to replicate the exact circuit dimensions each time?

Like, Monaco for example; I can’t help it but to think with how fast they drive and due to the unforgiving nature of the circuit, a smallest discrepancy/inaccuracy of a barrier placed while re-building the track could mean a driver ends up in a wall, no? Like, even if it’s 1-2 cm off from last year(s). 

obviously unless I’m wrong and street tracks are in fact inconsistent with how accurate they get rebuilt each year. (Even in extremely small margins) ","['When I was in Monaco, many of the kerbs were permanent fixtures.

There are surveyors that do this type of thing everyday all over the world for every road project. \n\nNow this is an especially fancy road project, but really, it's just road works. And with the money involved the engineering model would have been built years ago for accuracy of replication.\n\nEdit. Line breaks and a typo."", 'The difference in conditions is way *way* bigger than the difference of a few centimetres at most for a barrier. Also, drivers don’t approach a weekend by trying to go to 100% on the first lap. They build up slowly, feeling out the track and the conditions. That’s how a driver who’s never driven a track before can be competitive straight away; knowing the track helps but everyone is learning it all the way through the weekend regardless of how many times they’ve driven it before. It’s subtlety different session to session, even lap to lap', "">a smallest discrepancy/inaccuracy of a barrier placed while re-building the track could mean a driver ends up in a wall, no?\n\nNo, because these drivers aren't driving blindly by muscle memory. It's not a video game. While they're good at remembering tracks and rough brake-points, they are the best *because* they constantly adapt and feel how the car behaves so they can extract the maximum based on their senses.\n\nBesides, car is never the same year after year, conditions (temp, humidity, rain, track surface, etc) varies wildly even between sessions.

The need for 2 stops in a race without refuelling, and where it's basically impossible to pass makes it hard to even create a list of possible plans. 
It might actually be very interesting for once.

The bottom cars could (I think they should) try to go for a early stop, maybe even 2 if they can remain in the same lap as the leaders. From then on it's about pushing a bit in clear air to undercut rivals and root for an early red flag - but not a safety car that could ruin everything.

The cars up front, outside of stopping whenever there's a safety car, are pretty limited in their ability to plan ahead, it all depends on whether there's a gap to pit without getting stuck in traffic. IMO it's too risky to wait for a SC. The leader in particular might need to run the race pushing more than recent Monaco GPs, to try and open up a gap if the pace is there.

Another possibility is for a team that has 1 car in the points and another just outside (13-14 or so) to do a KMAG type of thing and create a massive gap for the lead driver to pit into.

1ku0hv9,McLaren First Garage after Pit Entry could be a Disaster?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ku0hv9/mclaren_first_garage_after_pit_entry_could_be_a/,2025-05-24, Discussion,"Particularly if there is a lap 1 incident, where it's likely that the entire field will look to pit. The top teams could be stuck in their box (maybe even stacked) as everyone else files through. Or more concerningly we could see unsafe releases with a lot of mechanics out there.

Did McLaren choose this end of the pits, or is this a track where it is assigned? It seems historically the WCC has been at this end, but the rule change may have warranted reconsideration. I recall there was a race within the last \~5 years or so where this sort of played out with the leader getting stuck in their box.

Early incidents have been surprisingly rare in the dry: [Every Safety Car ever at Monaco](https://www.lightsoutblog.com/every-safety-car-deployment-at-the-monaco-grand-prix/)

2024 - red flag on lap 2 made the pit stop issue moot

2019 - lap 11 SC. There was contact in the pits between Verstappen and Bottas when 2-3-4 pitted concurrently (Bottas was in 2nd and had backed off a gap from Lewis in 1st). Ricciardo was in 5th and already 30 seconds behind this group, so no other teams were out in the pit lane yet. Even then, only half the field pit under this SC.

2014 - lap 1. Only a couple backmarkers/cars with damage pitted
