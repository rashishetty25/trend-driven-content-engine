Hence, hard focus RBR rookies only.\n\n‚óè Yuki is not someone who's listen to papaya rules in a RBR.\n\n‚óè Yuki isn't particularly consistent. He hasn't been for 2 seasons. I'm assuming they're thinking once these younger drivers come into form they will become more consistent.\n\n‚óè Finally I'm sure they wouldn't want anyone in an RBR who isn't ready to be 2nd place to Max in every single GP even if Max has a bad race.

To better integrate into the Italian team, as well as Loic Serra himself, the English driver is taking Italian lessons and it was no coincidence that he expressed a few words in our language already in Abu Dhabi, while entering the Ferrari box. ‚Äú99% of our work is in English but I think it is nice to know how to speak a little Italian for the mechanics and for the relationship within the team‚Äù ‚Äì said Fred Vasseur in this regard, who then took care to underline also in a somewhat joking manner that ‚Äúit is not essential for performance‚Äù. \n\n\nVasseur: ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt difficult to convince Hamilton that the Ferrari project was excellent‚Äù\n\n\nBetween the end of last year and the beginning of 2024 , the planets aligned to bring Lewis Hamilton to Ferrari. ‚ÄúI think sometimes it\'s also a question of coincidences and last year they were all there, that is, Lewis was on the market and Ferrari had a seat available.‚Äù ‚Äì said the Ferrari TP at the traditional Christmas lunch in Maranello, who then wanted to focus on the arguments useful for convincing the seven-time world champion to accept the offer of the Italian team. ‚ÄúFirst of all, in 2023 we won more races than Mercedes. And the start of the season had also been good, so it wasn\'t too difficult to convince him that Ferrari would be a good project . And I think he had been thinking about driving for Ferrari for at least 20 years because we were already discussing it in 2004,‚Äù revealed the French manager.\n\n\nThe seven-time world champion will arrive at Ferrari after a very long experience in a team like Mercedes , quite different in its working methods and without that Niki Lauda who was fundamental initially and who made the environment within the Anglo-German team very special. ‚ÄúI am not sure that we have to do a copy and paste of what Mercedes did, where the environment worked very well at the beginning, a little less at the end.‚Äù ‚Äì said Vasseur ‚Äì ‚ÄúMy objective in fact is not to do a copy and paste of what has been done in the past, or to try to attract all the people from Mercedes and to create a Mercedes team that have not been champions in the last two or three years, but to find the best way to manage Lewis differently with our team, with our guys and our resources‚Äù. \n\n\n\nVasseur believes that managing the Leclerc-Hamilton duo will be even easier than the Leclerc-Sainz duo \n\n\nMuch of the curiosity of the insiders during the next season will be to understand and see how Fred Vasseur will be able to manage the desire of Charles Leclerc to enter the history of Ferrari by winning his first world title and that of a seven-time world champion who would further enter the history of F1 by becoming the first driver to win 8 world championships, the last with a Ferrari that has not won it since the now distant 2007 (drivers). ""This year my challenge was to manage Charles and Carlos, but I think it was part of our performance because I am truly convinced that emulation in the team is the key to the performance of the entire team , "" said the French manager, who thinks in a way that is practically opposite to the Red Bull identity, where all the efforts are concentrated on the Verstappen side of the box. \n\n\n‚ÄúWe had a couple of heated moments between Charles and Carlos. Monza 2023 or even Las Vegas 2024 for example. But in the end, I think it was beneficial for the team‚Äôs performance .‚Äù ‚Äì said Vasseur, who then wanted to explain how these sporting disagreements have never damaged the Scuderia in terms of points collected ‚Äì ‚ÄúManaging Charles and Lewis? I‚Äôm not particularly worried, given that they have a huge mutual respect and know each other well. They have been talking about their future relationship for months now.

So I'm going to go with the opinion of the person with the best knowledge to answer this question. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/5scvYrmO4tM?t=3864"", 'No. I didn‚Äôt know about the quote in the other reply but Massa‚Äôs own version of events is basically exactly how I see it.\n\nMassa for me always had severe limitations. On a regular race weekend he could compete well but when the car wasn‚Äôt great and he wasn‚Äôt running out front, he just didn‚Äôt seem to have the consistency or racecraft of a top driver and he made too many errors. \n\nThere were really only four or five races where Massa could keep up with Schumacher in 2006, and that‚Äôs not far off what we saw with Alonso in 2010. He scored 57.1% of Alonso‚Äôs points that year compared to 66.1% vs Schumi. I would argue that isn‚Äôt due to Massa being weaker in 2010, but more the competition was much stronger. There were three top-tier cars in 2010 compared to two in 2006 and that one of those 2006 cars had a woeful Fisichella in it. An average day for Massa simply left him with a worse result - including relative to his team-mate - in 2010.\n\nThe next few years Massa dipped to 45.9%, 43.8% and 46.2% of Alonso‚Äôs points. However, between the 2012 summer break and Spain 2013, we saw a significant upturn in form that saw him score 66.3% of Alonso‚Äôs points - almost the exact same as he scored vs Schumacher in 2006, demonstrating that previous level was still within him. During that stretch he scored all three of his post-2010 Ferrari podiums and had some other excellent battling drives from positions of adversity like in Singapore. He also did it during a stretch where Alonso was quite clearly at the top of his game, so Massa was almost certainly the variable here. \n\nI think what really affected Massa from the start of 2011 until that late 2012-early 2013 spell was that Ferrari were much less competitive than in 2010, then in Monaco 2013 he had two heavy crashes and it felt like that dented his confidence, because he dipped again after that.\n\nPeople will say ‚ÄòSurely he improved in 2007 and 2008 and then declined?‚Äô. I would agree 2007 was his best year, he made fewer mistakes than in other prime years except the first half of 2009. In 2008 he was very erratic and was made to look good by Raikkonen making several errors of his own in addition to the team‚Äôs development path working against him.', 'Massa , himself has denied that. He has pointed out that the most acid criticism came from the press. He believes that his lack of victories in F1 is not related to the accident, but to the lack of competitive cars.\n\n  \n""Nobody ever told me I wasn¬¥t the same. Unfortunately I was denied victory in Germany, in the race that took place exactly one year after my accident, on July 25,2010.That was one of the saddest days of my life. After that, I experienced a different period, because I no longer had a competitive car to compete for victories as I did before.""', 'In my opinion, Massa hit his best form in 2008-2009 for a period of 1.5 years (although in 2008 he was still very error prone). His head injury basically brought him back down to 2002-2007 level from 2010-2017.\n\nHis head injury probably did affect him slightly, but definitely not to the extent people often say. We have Smedley and Massa himself saying the injury did not affect him. The Alonso-Massa-Raikkonen and Alonso-Massa-Fisichella teammate chains which include pre and post injury Massa are relatively consistent with each other. He was smoked by Schumacher in 2006, indicating he was never a top driver. One of his strongest periods relative to Alonso was the first half of 2010, which is when you would expect any effects to be at their greatest. Perhaps you could argue Germany 2010 had a greater impact than his head injury, because his form really started to fall off after that.\n\nI think basically because Raikkonen was a bit overrated, Massa sort of became overrated by proxy, so when Massa did much worse next to Alonso than he did to Raikkonen, it was explained away by Massa not being the same after his accident (as people at the time thought Raikkonen was very close to Alonso). Then when Raikkonen did similar if not worse in 2014 than Massa did in 2010-2013, it became clearer that Raikkonen was perhaps just not as good as what people initially thought. Raikkonen then easily getting beaten by Vettel across 2015-2018 also backs this up.', 'I think the ""Alonso is faster than you"" incident did more. The first 10 races into Alonso and Massa as team mates saw Massa in decent form, or returning to it, but I think that set the tone for rest of the partnership in terms of how Ferrari would treat him for the rest of his days at Ferrari\n\nMika Hakinnen came back from a life threatening accident to become world champion with support from Mclaren and Ron Dennis linked to his return to form. Ferrari did things to Massa like deliberately breaking the seal of his gearbox to induce a 5 place grid penalty, when Alonso was 2 places behind him after qualifying.']",5,12,0.78,5,10,10,1,2,0.08000000000000007,1

You have to assume your at best hoping for a mid pack season ending, chances of being a top 3 team are slim.
