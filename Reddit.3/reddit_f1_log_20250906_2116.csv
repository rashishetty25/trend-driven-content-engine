Just wanted to share some frustration and perhaps also a warning. We bought tickets for an F1 experience at Monza that included a pit walk, trophy photo and a track tour.... So the starter package ü§£

Anyway long story short when we did the pit walk all the cars were covered and garages were basically closed. So you pay a lot of money.... Well for me it's a lot and you end up with this.

Anyway maybe I was expecting too much. But if you are planning doing some similar maybe ask them what time you will do the pit walk and if it will be open.

The season was also tinged with tragedy: Antonio Ascari, winner at Spa, lost his life just a month later in Montlh√©ry. The 1925 World Championship was the first world championship title assigned in the history of motorsport, and it was the first of five World Championships for Alfa Romeo, since it would be followed by the 1950 and 1951 Formula 1 World Drivers' Championship and by the 1975 and 1977 World Sportscar Championships. After the victory Alfa Romeo added a metal laurel wreath to the company's logo, which was used in various forms until 1982.","['Alfas...reliable? Top Gear has lied to me', 'Isn‚Äôt it amazing that we still have Grand Prix racing at Monza exactly 100 years later?\n\nCurious if this will be mentioned on the main broadcast. If only we could @Crofty', 'Amazing season, you had to be there', ""Amazing footage, humans got the taste for speed pretty quickly after the invention of cars.\n\nSad for the Ascari's, both father and son died at 36, on the 26th day of the month, at Monza and Spa.\n\nMost of those people are no longer with us, makes me think about the people I am alive around now, they'll be the only humans I'll interact with until the next cohort arrives, a minuscule slice of the billion years long timeline."", 'Most reliable along the Bugattis, which were much slower, and the fastest along the Delages and the Duesenbergs, which were much more unreliable. The P2 was the best package during those years.', ""The only reason Alfa Romeo has a reputation for poor reliability is poor design, insufficient testing, poor build quality, poor QC, lack of rust protection and the electronics. If you can overlook those few small issues it's a great car."", 'Big shame that there was no Fiat or Mercedes after how competitive they were in 1924. So no Bordino either and Sunbeam not as competitive as 1924.\n\nI always wondered why they didn‚Äôt include the Spanish Grand Prix in the new WMC.', ""I agree, having Fiat and Sunbeam with their early 1924 form and Mercedes on a rising curve would have made the 1925 WMC even more interesting since the fight would have been bigger as more constructors would have likely been able to win.\n\n\nI know that Fiat withdrew its racing team after experiencing an exodus of engineers and technicians to Alfa Romeo led by Vittorio Jano, who had been convinced by Enzo Ferrari to move to Alfa. Fiat experienced a performance loss, culminated in the disaster of the French Grand Prix, and returned only in 1927 with the new 806.\xa0\n\n\nMercedes wasn't instead able to participate as Germany was not yet part of AIACR, they got included during 1925 so they could partecipate to the 1926 season, when they managed to win a couple of races.\n\n\nI've read a couple of explanations during the years about the reasons the San Sebastian Grand Prix wasn't included in the championship calendar. The main one is that Italy, as organiser of the championship (Arturo Mercanti, presidente of the Italian Club and founder of the Autodromo di Monza, was the one who dratfed the first regulations for the WMC), vetoed the inclusion of a grand prix in Spain in response to the ban received by Diatto and Alfieri Maserati the year prior during a hill climb race in Rabassada.\xa0""]",96,8,0.96,96,8,8,-3,0,0.0,-3
