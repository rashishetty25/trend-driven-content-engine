1j6ituc,Ferrari’s other big Mercedes signing – and how he’s helped Hamilton,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j6ituc/ferraris_other_big_mercedes_signing_and_how_hes/,2025-03-08, Discussion,"When Ferrari made its bold move to sign Lewis Hamilton from Mercedes, it dominated the headlines. But alongside the seven-time world champion, the Scuderia also secured the services of Loïc Serra as technical director chassis and, more quietly, Jérôme d’Ambrosio.

While his arrival didn’t create the same media frenzy, d’Ambrosio is already making a significant impact behind the scenes.

# The Perfect Fit for Ferrari

Described by team principal Fred Vasseur as having **“the perfect profile”**, d’Ambrosio took on the role of deputy team principal and head of the Ferrari Driver Academy in October 2023.

His experience in both racing and team management makes him an ideal lieutenant for Vasseur as Ferrari undergoes a transformation ahead of Hamilton’s arrival in 2025.

With seasons increasing in length, the scope for learning from a replacement has also increased. Moreover, the coming season has many rookie drivers. Finally, the season after has a host of rule changes and it will be important to have a pair of drivers that are sufficiently experienced to deal with new conditions.

Another rookie or one of the drivers waiting in the docks (think about Bottas' role at Mercedes).","[""I think it's a given that it will be Doohan lmao.

1j6jwwi,Reasons for Red bull performance drop?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j6jwwi/reasons_for_red_bull_performance_drop/,2025-03-08, Discussion,"It's clear from the pre-season testing that red bull aren't where they expect to be. 
Whilst pre-season testing isn't a reliable indicator of a team's performance of the coming season, its undeniable that red bull's performance has fallen off since mid 2024. 

My question is how can a team that was so dominant, winning all but 1 race in 2023, be where they are right now, without a change in regulations?

Red bull's internal issues aside (power struggle, hornergate, newey departure) how much of the performance drop can be attributed to reduction of development time & money from finishing 1st for several consecutive seasons + cost cap breach penalty (-10% wind tunnel time) + late grasp of the current regulations by competitors?

In terms of absolute performance, Max was faster at every comparable race (2023 vs 2024) in the latter half of the calendar (Quali times). The smallest gap is 0.285s faster (Italian GP), ballooning to 1.09s faster (Mexico) and 2.7s faster (COTA) neither of which occasions he got pole!\n\nWhat actually happened was that the competition caught and passed Red Bull, which creates the impression of Red Bull falling away. To give you an idea, Sainz went 1.287s faster YoY in Mexico, compared to Max's 1.09s improvement."", ""Convergence. Red Bull hit their development ceiling before everyone else. If they can gain a tenth of a second on their rivals today, that is a big gain. Also, they went down a rabbit hole on their upgrades last season and they lost the handle on their car. Sounds like they have opened up the operating window on this year's car but will it be quick enough?"", 'people always mention newey leaving but the list of ‘lower level’ engineers and employees that left was insane that will definitely have its effect on a team', 'Don’t rule them out.. they like to sandbag in testing a lot', ""I think it boils down to how difficult it is to develop, setup and correlate cars with the sim in these regs. Every team had trouble at some point, Red Bull just got a headstart and their problems (which were already there) seemed insignificant in comparison... until the other teams cleaned up their acts and suddenly Red Bull's weaknesses are now huge. \n\nAlso, Max. Hes amazing and gets the maximum points their cars can get, but his tendency to be able to drive around a cars problems can be problematic. It was already the case in 2019/2020, when they realized Max's skills were making them see things wrongly, and they course corrected in 2021 with a much more stable car. The same thing seems to have happened again last year.\n\nIm sure the chaos in the team doesnt help, but I dont think its the main factor."", 'It\'s actually quite similar to the Honda situation with Marquez in MotoGP, they built a bike that only he could ride with his Natural style, then he got injured and they found themselves in a crap situation with a bike that nobody could ride,they probably went even more in that direction ,then when he came back (although with and injured arm) he also struggled because the bike got to a point where It was too extreme to ride at the limit , or else you would risk crashing, honda\'s issues were also other stuff and they have carried over to now, redbull found a faster fix with different setups that gave at least max a familiar feeling.\nOf course the driver here does count, no doubt , but you cannot win with a 15th Place car/bike, or even with a 6th Place car if we look at It that way, so i think a lot of It Is down to confidence and how easy Is It to drive, teams and media Say the ""they drive over problems""stuff also because It makes the driver look Better, while It May be in part true, It\'s not as easy as that', 'There is a difference between a drop in performance and a lack of improvement. I think what is happening to Red Bull is more a case of the latter. The history of F1 is full of similar cases. Also, let’s keep in mind Newey’s departure.
