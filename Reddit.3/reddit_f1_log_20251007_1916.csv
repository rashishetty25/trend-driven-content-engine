They will come out of it sooner or later, but when? And above all, how?*\n\n>*Things were better when they were worse, my dear lady, when there was someone who kept saying: we must understand. Because the approach to the problem, or problems, was straightforward: identification, understanding, correction.*\n\n>*Today, problems are not discovered one by one: they come thick and fast. And the trend is exactly the opposite of a year ago: the development of the car has not been a strong point for Maranello, but the exposed root that has repeatedly tripped them up. The fruit of the work of hyper-specialist Loic Serra has not been forthcoming.*\n\n>**Ferrari, a sharp decline in performance**\n\n>*As the season progressed, first with the rule against front wing flexing (which Mercedes managed to get around very well, as we saw in Singapore) and then with the rear suspension of the SF-25 revised after months of work, the performance of the Reds deteriorated. The curve has taken a nosedive - a sad coincidence - since Fred Vasseur's contract was extended for another three years: that was on 31 July, and since then there have been five races, whose separate rankings speak for themselves. Ferrari, with only 50 points (10 per GP), olapped by McLaren (134), Mercedes (105) and almost by Red Bull (98), has not performed much better than Williams, Aston Martin and Racing Bulls.*\n\n>**Ferrari, the latest headache**\n\n>*Overheating brakes and constant recommendations to drivers to slow down to cool them down were just the latest technical headache for a car that lacks aerodynamic downforce and has to drive low to the ground to go fast, but not too low, otherwise it ends up disqualified, as in China. What is disturbing is the perception of a team in which nothing works anymore: Leclerc points the finger at the car, Hamilton at the team (division of departments, procedures, working protocols). The engineers are struggling, and Vasseur has reached his sixth month of excuses: among the usual references to “good race pace”, “untapped potential” and “failure to execute”, on Sunday he said that “Lewis was fantastic but pushed so hard that he overheated the brakes”. In short, Ferrari's bug seems to be an excess of perfection, already mentioned after the double disqualification in Shanghai.*\n\n>**Tense atmosphere in Maranello, tensions in the pits**\n\n>*All this further ruins the atmosphere within the team, with new tensions emerging. On Saturday after qualifying, the tone between Vasseur and a senior technician became heated in a very tense discussion: sources in Maranello suggest that the other party was Matteo Togninalli, the highly capable head of track engineering.*\n\n>*Among the technicians themselves, there are those who are angry with Leclerc for his uncompromising criticism of the car and how it is managed. Charles was blunt on Sunday night: ‘Mercedes has made great strides forward, as Red Bull did a few races ago, but we haven't. It's difficult in these conditions to be optimistic and think that the situation can change in the last few GPs.’*\n\n>**Ferrari, the new technical cycle**\n\n>Now, his entourage is hinting at a desire to shift the focus of major decisions from the heart to the head: the new technical cycle that is coming cannot be wasted, so talks are underway with several teams with a view to 2027, as the driver cannot compromise his entire career for the sake of the Scuderia. The choices will only mature in 2026, and this applies to all drivers, who want to see the validity of the new projects before deciding on the direction of their future. The possible market variations today form a dense network, at the centre of which are Mercedes - said to have a big advantage in the design of the new engine - and its customer McLaren. \n\n>The frightening thing is that, amid all this technical confusion, in Maranello, this group with these ideas, in this gloomy and tense climate, with this team principal, is designing the car that will decide the fate of Ferrari for the next five years.""]",2332,494,0.97,2332,465,465,97,16,0.0,97

This video gives a really cool sense of the logistics and communications that happen during a GP just to keep the camera angles flowing.

Seeing this behind the scenes gives some cool perspective, though. You *really* can't just have some joe blow who knows wheel come in and do a good job with it - even to make poor decisions effectively, the director needs a level of experience in doing this specific task. 

And, it also begs a question for me.

1o09v6k,Sergey Sirotkin's F1 career,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o09v6k/sergey_sirotkins_f1_career/,2025-10-07, Discussion,"It's actually shocking to me how forgotten Sergey Sirotkin actually is, because I remember a time when he was probably the most hated driver in the F1 world. For all of you who weren't watching F1 in 2013, for the longest time, it was looking like Sauber was going to be signing eighteen year old Sergey Sirotkin for one of their seats.

Some context is required here. This was before the debut of Max Verstappen, and back during a time where entering F1 in your early twenties was considered young. Another thing to remember was that this was before the super licence point scheme was introduced, meaning that any driver who completed enough testing mileage could get themselves a super licence. Including teenagers with very little success to boast about.

So yeah, there was a lot of fear and hate around the prospect of an unproven Russian teenager getting an F1 seat purely down to money, and this was on top of all the other driver transfers that were going on at the same time. Pastor Maldonado got the then coveted Lotus seat over Nico Hulkenberg that people at the time already felt was robbed of the Ferrari seat, and Daniil Kvyat getting the Toro Rosso drive over Antonio Felix Da Costa, it was one of the more depressing silly seasons to watch during my time as an F1 fan.

However as things turned out, Sirotkin didn't get the F1 drive for 2014, and following Verstappen's entry into F1 in 2015, the FIA created the super licence points system in order to prevent under qualified drivers with loads of money from claiming seats without any real success in single seater series. Sirotking however would return to the F1 radar in 2017, and sadly for him, it's still resulted in a lot of hate.

This time, the hate came from the fact that Williams had already signed Lance Stroll for 2018, and the choice of second driver was coming down between signing Sirotkin or a returning Robert Kubica. Robert Kubica returning to F1 after his awful injury was something we all wanted to see happen. Combined with rumours that Vodka Martini (Williams' main sponsor at the time) wanted a 25+ year old driver resulted in disappointment for many when Sirotkin got the F1 drive instead.

In fairness to Sirotkin, he did finish third in the 2016 GP2 season. Granted, he was a long way back from Giovinazzi and Gasly, but they were both in Premas, and Sirotkin now had the bare minimum results we expected from an F1 rookie. But the problem here was that Charles Leclerc was also entering F1 as a rookie at the same time, and he was hyped as hell. I remember reading an article on Motorsport comparing the two preseason. One was entering F1 with a lot of love and expectation, the other was being viewed as the driver who took Kubica's seat away from him.

So with all this hate going his way before he even started the season, how was he actually in F1...he was okay I guess. Wasn't the best driver in the world, but he was driving by far the worst car on the grid last year, and he showed some good dosage of speed every once in a while such as Monaco and Germany. He even scored a point in Italy, in a car that had no business scoring anything. If I had to rank him in terms of quality, I'd say he was better than Sargent, but worse than Zhou.

But in the end of the day, I think we saw everything he was going to offer F1. Williams would sign Russell and Kubica for 2019, and with it, all memory of Sirotkin's time in F1 all but evaporated, including the hate he suffered for years. As miraculous as it was seeing Kubica back in F1, he was beaten pretty convincingly by Russell, and I don't think Sirotkin would've been any different.","[""Has a degree in race car engineering, and came in when Williams started turning to shit. Wasn't uncommon for him to test the upgrades, only for them to then be put on Lances car!\n\nA fast driver that brought cash and solid engineering feedback. Exactly what Williams needed at that time."", 'The only thing I remember is him gifting his pit crew watches in Hungary 2018.', ""I don't remember all the hate for him. He was a solid driver that was seen as having an excellent engineering mind and was very kind to his entire team if the stories are true. Way above guys like Mazepin or Latifi, I'd probably rate him similarly to Ericsson, Nasr or Palmer in skill."", 'There was an interview Gasly did at the start of this year where he let slip that he had been told the Russian GP promoter really incentivised (in some way) having a russian driver in a seat for as long as it was on the calendar - and that’s why Kvyat had the seat over him for 2017 initially, why Sirotkin was signed so late for 2018 (to cover Kvyat’s departure) and why Kvyat was brought back for 2019. \n\nWe can’t be certain how true it is, or who he heard it from, but it’s interesting. Kvyat goes and another russian is brought in - first Sirotkin, then Mazepin.', 'Sirotkin the most hated driver? Where was that?', ""Don't think he was hated. There's plenty of other drivers that were hated."", ""I don't think he was that hated. He just flew under the radar. Realistically the only targets at the time was Stroll and Hamilton(just because of his dominance) but the sub was a bit more mature then"", 'Thank you, Sergey, for your post.', 'He had a really really good Singapore GP, even if it resulted in nothing']",0,32,0.42,0,31,31,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
