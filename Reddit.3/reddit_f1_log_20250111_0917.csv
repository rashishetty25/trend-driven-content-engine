I have been watching for the last fours seasons and want to delve more into some of the Formula 1 books but was not sure if he dumbs anything down or if it is for people with more advanced understanding of the ins and outs of an F1 car.

I also had the Frank Williams Book on my list and have picked up a couple more I’m planning to read this offseason.

I would appreciate any other suggestions! Thanks!","['The Newest book reads pretty well. Since you think of reading it, I assume you like the topic of aerodynamics at least a bit so you should be fine.\n\nThe Mechanic by Marc Priestly and Life to the Limit by Jenson Button are also nice reads', ""He does a decent job of explaining each part and design process of the car, I didn't find it too technical  at all, and it was a great read.""]",1,2,0.67,1,2,2,1,2,0.67,1
1hyozsz,Why Sainz is sure to improve Williams pace overtime,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hyozsz/why_sainz_is_sure_to_improve_williams_pace/,2025-01-11, Discussion,"  I was watching some old videos from Red Bull Racing, where they followed Liam and Alex throughout their DTM season, and what really caught my attention was that in the parts where they are discussing what needs to be changed in the car, what's bothering them and etc., you can notice how they focus on the consequences and not the actual problem. For an example in this video (10:30-11:30): [https://youtu.be/kgYVQcOZPC8?si=WxpTPVuiymtWTY7U&t=630](https://youtu.be/kgYVQcOZPC8?si=WxpTPVuiymtWTY7U&t=630), it's all about how the car is understeery, how it feels to take a turn and how it affects their lap.  
  
  Sainz, in the other hand immediately gives a direction for the team to focus on, while asking for more data so he can be sure that what he's asking is in the right path, like we can see in the new Williams video (5:21-6:30): [https://youtu.be/wi7XrM020j8?si=wwAtLQp8mOLwghbo&t=321](https://youtu.be/wi7XrM020j8?si=wwAtLQp8mOLwghbo&t=321).

  Obviously we'll never know everything that each drivers discuss with their team and how they appproach it, but i don't know, if what the team was comfortable sharing with us already shows so much of how he actually is engaged in the setup, behind the scenes (as he hints in 6:11-6:22, with how the last tunings made already betterded the car a lot) must be pretty impressive, is no wonder why that every team he's been part of improved quickly with his arrival.","['It’s the team that gets better over time. A single person is not going to turn a whole organization around. Williams has been either 9th or 10th in constructors and will likely stay there for the foreseeable future.\n\nI don’t doubt Sainz is a top tier driver and he has definitely made teams flow smoother along the way but you have to be realistic. The narrative that Sainz has made teams better once he’s there is just happenstance. When he was at McLaren that team started to get on the right track once Fernando left. 2019 was a good year for them and they have gotten faster since. With Ferrari, we know this has been a top 3 team for decades.', 'Drivers do not develop the car and setup feedback is not design work.\n\nCarlos is a great technical driver that often talks about or shows that he enjoys and cares about the tech, but it isn’t him that will make decisions about what to do with the new floor or the data from CFD. What he can do is find the right balance between practice sessions and during the preparations in the simulator. And of course help with feedback for correlation purposes, but that’s also mostly data collection.']",0,2,0.3,0,2,2,0,2,0.3,0
