If I'm reading correctly the number one was assigned to the winning team since 1974 not necessarily the driver?

The newest regulations where a driver has a permanent number and the ability to use number one I believe went into effect in 2014 with Vettel.

- ~~Jacques Villeneuve (moved teams after winning)~~

- Lewis Hamilton chose to stick with #44 *but used it with McLaren*
- *Mansell (retired)*
- *Prost (retired)*

However I do still see a remarkable number of people espousing the view that Prost merely got lucky that Mansell had his blowout in Adelaide, or that Williams subsequently called Piquet into the pits for a precautionary stop at that same race. By going into the season race-by-race in this article, I hope to highlight that Prost's triumph was not merely the product of luck, but rather one of the greatest sustained campaigns in Formula 1 history, and perhaps even a template for today's drivers on how to clinch a title against the odds..."", 'I guess this is a good time as any to ask this: Am I crazy or was the French calling him the teacher?

His racing philosophy is the prevalent one now."", 'This was the time when best 11 results counted isn’t it ?', 'Yes.', 'Glad to hear you enjoyed it!', 'Yeah, the problem is probably max Is in that situation non Russell, inferior  car but  taking advance of every McLaren error, Mercedes look to slow ti be a title contender']",32,16,0.89,32,15,15,1,1,0.020000000000000018,1

The pitlane and garages are still there near Woodcote and are used by junior series, so why did F1 move? The logical option imo would be to keep F1 in the iconic place and put feeder categories to the other building.
