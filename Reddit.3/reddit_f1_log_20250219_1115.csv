While he will start the championship with rookie Jack Doohan as a team-mate, he will discover another collaboration, but looks forward very positively to 2023 and 2024.\n\nDespite some tense moments, right up to the controversial collision at the Monaco Grand Prix last May, the French driver considers that Alpine was lucky to have this duo, particularly in the way it salvaged an unexpected sixth place in the constructors' championship last year.\n\n“It's true that we haven't really had the opportunity to say goodbye,” confided Pierre Gasly on Tuesday in London, when Esteban Ocon had left Alpine for Haas prematurely, not taking part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. “I think it was, when you think about it, the kind of story that we'll find hallucinating in twenty or thirty years' time. When we were told it was impossible to make it in F1, we both made it, in the same French team. It's a very beautiful story, with the podium in Brazil that will remain memorable.”\n\n**Fortunately, there were two drivers like us, both talented and motivated.**\n\nPierre Gasly also believes that the 100% French duo, while explosive on paper, proved the most skeptical of the pairing wrong.\n\n“We've proved that we're professionals,” he insists. “Everyone told us it would be a mess with both of us on the team. But it's a good thing there were two drivers like us, talented and motivated, because in-house competition allows us to give it our all. We never gave up, and if we managed to turn around what was a very complicated season last year, it's also partly thanks to the work we did together. We can be happy about that.”\n\nFrom now on, Pierre Gasly will cross paths with his compatriot on the track, but in the colors of Haas, which doesn't necessarily change his state of mind.\n\n“The rivalry has always been there,” he admits. “I've got 19 rivals on the grid, whether it's Esteban, Charles \\[Leclerc\\], Lewis \\[Hamilton\\]... After that, there are animosities between everyone and it's up to us to manage that. I'm a professional, I fight hard on the track but with respect, no matter who I'm up against.”"", ""Let's be real here.  The problem at Alpine isn't Ocon and Gasly.  It's fucking Alpine.   I think they made the best out of a very bad situation.  Yes, they had a couple of dust ups  (all the teams do, now and again, don't they?), but they were \\*not\\* the problem."", 'The final straw for me with DTS was them trying to spin it into being a disaster. \n\nAlpine might be a mess, both those guys did just fine together.', 'I remember joking that it was going to be ""dinamite"". I\'m happy they had Brazil as a goodbye as team mates, they both looked really happy.', 'Gasly’s F1 career could be a blockbuster movie trilogy at some point\n\nPart 1: Having arrived to the sport as a hot up-and-coming talent, he gets a shot at the front of the field next to one of the most talented drivers to ever exist. The pressure mounts, he flounders in comparison to his teammate, and winds up getting demoted back into the midfield. Around the same time, one of his best friends tragically loses his life. Determined as ever, Gasly puts up some of the best midfield performances ever, climaxing at his Monza 2020 win and continuing through 2021.\n\nPart 2: Gasly decides that after seeing AlphaTauri’s struggles in 2022, it’s time for a change of scenery. He winds up getting pitted against a childhood rival whom the media attempts to paint as his enemy. Their first year together is marred with collisions in Australia and Hungary, and the start of their second year sees them floundering at the tail end of the field. However, they have some stellar performances at the season end, highlighted by the double podium in Brazil, and wind up way higher up the WCC order than they anticipated at the start of the year.\n\nPart 3: ???', ""Between Gasly and Ocon it really wasn't. Melbourne 2023 was a freak accident for which there didn't appear to be any real animosity between them, and Monaco 2024 was silly by Ocon but the team reaction was extremely irrational and made it Wade worse than it had to be...\n\nI think in some ways it was probably easier for them to work together in a professional manner given they weren't trying to preserve any personal friendship while also competing directly against one another.\n\nBrazil 2024 was a really nice send-off for their partnership honestly."", ""It might have been a mess.

1isqpvu,Overall Event Thoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1isqpvu/overall_event_thoughts/,2025-02-18, Discussion,"We are littered with posts on all the specifics for the event but what are peoples overall thoughts on it?

**My thoughts:**

Ultimately I think it was a waist of time and it really was a ""spot the difference"" event on the livery for most of the cars. I am not apposed to the idea of some from of season launch event, but it needs work.

\- Jack Whitehall made it not boring and I like his work but I also think he does fit the sport. The event would have been worse without him but it needed someone else that fits better.

\- There has been far to much confusion on event day and leading up to it. Seeing ""F1"" based TikTok accounts where the ""fans"" talking about car shakedown stealth liveries thinking they final etc.

\- I just think it was odd with some 2024 cars, some with a version of the 2025 car in livery was messy

\- The drivers, wether in suits or not and everything not consistent just felt messy

\- Clearly some drivers did not want to be there. I am not sure how you handle it next time but not like that.

\- It has to be an event that has more, news, break down, help new fans with season summary and not just a spot the difference on livery design with awkward interviews and comments.

**Things to change for 2025:**

\- It needs to be rebranded as a the ""F1 season launch event"" where it does show off the teams and cars but more generalised to represent it as an event getting ready for the season  
\- Teams shakedowns if before event need to be behind close doors  
\- Cars have to be new car (or close to) with new livery  
\- No livery or outfit reveals of any kind by the teams before the event  
\- Drivers need to be on stage in race gear with hermit's  
\- Team marketing and press information releases after the event  
\- Set better date for the event considering the other points  
\- Presenter who has energy but has more connections with the sport

Otherwise it really is pointless","[""Overall it wasn't bad, but it's a bit silly when half the teams don't have a new livery so what is really the point."", 'whitehall was hilarious and ramsay was heroic', 'to me, wasnt that bad, was doing other things with it in the background, wouldn’t pay to go, but don’t really swhy people wanted it to be bad, Its better than having 10 separate corporate events everyone hated last year, but ig people likes things they hated when they no longer have the choice to hate it', ""But there's not enough time F1 season is ending in late December and after that everyone needs 1 month's break minimum so i dont think you can push this event to an early date"", 'How do you propose they do a shakedown behind closed doors? Do you know of any indoor races tracks suitable for an F1 car?', 'I don\'t think it was bad at all for a first event. As far as I know this has been a ""one off"" with the potential of making it permanent in the future. Obviously a lot of improvement could be done so it actually has a bit of meaning, but overall I think it was quite nice.\n\nNot everyone has to be exactly the same, I kinda liked that AM did whatever they wanted to do and we won\'t have 10 times just a car with 2 drivers coming on the stage and have the same stuff. It also fits their branding to come in a smoking instead of race suits and all. Imo there should be a nice balance between some serious ""reveals"" and have whatever the teams etc want to do. That way it\'s nice and fun to watch, and it doesn\'t feel like you are watching an FIA PC or something.', 'Am i the only one who enjoyed it thoroughly??', ""I liked the fact that the teams had the freedom to present their cars and drivers as they wished. At least I think it was done by the individual teams and not one single director. \n\nIf you ignore the fact that the liveries were almost identical to last year, I'm sure you will agree that these are some great looking cars!"", ""Music: not needed, terrible. Or, get one big star not a mishmash of low level performers. There should have been some kind of performance, whether an orchestra or huge band (with a mariachi interlude!), of the F1 theme. That should have closed the show, not Take That which had no relevance whatsoever to F1 and basically no relevance at all these days. \n\nJack Whitehall: he was great. Whoever wrote his script was right on; irreverent and funny. His presentation skills were great too. Loved that F1 allowed him to poke fun at them.\n\nMontages: could have been better. \n\nThe best thing: no MBS. I'd guess he'd want to be there and I'd also guess F1 told him it probably wasn't a good idea. \n\nOverall: I enjoyed it but hope they don't do it every year. I don't think they would; very expensive to put on that event and they definitely didn't make money from it.""]",0,95,0.3,0,80,80,0,5,-0.030000000000000027,0
