Any time they get grumpy, it's a little bit actually towards me and Andrea because we're trying to be fair and balanced. And I think the fact that they've both been a little bit grumpy at times with us actually tells you things have been fair and balanced because we're trying to make sure they race clean, and they are.  
  
All the incidents that they've had, which isn't that many, have all just been, at the end of the day, racing incidents. But we want to make sure the championship's decided on the track and not through that. I think we're lucky that we have the two drivers that we have.  
  
I'm not sure that Andrea and I and the team would be able to manage other drivers the way we can Oscar and Lando. So I think a lot of credit is due to just who they are as individuals.

I'm looking for a book or books for my child that would be some kind of encyclopedia, but not too much.
I have seen Buxton's and JL Moncet's but I was wondering if there are other nice to have, even from previous years.
Having the possibility to get it in French is a plus.

Many thanks.","[""I can help! I'm a librarian and we have some F1 books in our kids section. What is the age range we're looking at?"", ""Since Jean-Louis Moncet's ~~memoir~~ (ETA: oops, didn't realize he had another book, but the sample of it looked reasonably similar) is on your list, perhaps you might consider the books from publisher Quarto's Ivy Press imprint's “Formula One” series, even though they might be on the pricier side.\n\nThey have an entire set of coffee table books covering different aspects of F1 historically up through modern-ish times, with lots of photographs. The level of English doesn't seem too complicated, and the mini-essay text pieces aren't that long, and accompanied by plenty of easy picture captions.\n\nThey're written by former F1 journalists including Maurice Hamilton (previously a motor racing correspondent for The Observer newspaper, and now a BBC Radio 5 commentator, according to his bioblurb), Tony Dodgins (previously with Autosport, now an occasional BBC TV commentator), and Frank Hopkinson (former deputy editor of F1 Racing magazine), and come with introductions by figures like Sir Jackie Stewart, Damon Hill, Mark Webber, etc., and include anecdotes as well as facts. There's something like 7 total so far on different topics such as circuits, controversies, and pivotal events. _Formula 1: The Pursuit of Speed_ which seems to be kind of an overview of the sport, but is from 2017 so it may be out of print in paper.\n\nI have the ones for _The Champions: 75 Years of Legendary F1 Drivers_ (also with quotes and vintage interviews; goes from Farina up to Verstappen) from 2025 and _The Rivals: F1's Greatest Duels_ from 2023 (16 chapters going from Fangio vs. Ascari up to Hamilton vs. Verstappen). I got them as ebooks bought during discount sales so I can't comment on the print quality of the paper editions, sorry, but they're pretty nice. You can see samples of the interior text/pictures over at the publisher's website catalogue at Quarto.com via the Google Play previews for the more recently published books.\n\nAlso, _Formula One Racing For Dummies_ by Jonathan Noble (journalist for Motorsport.com and The Race) is available in French translation as _La Formule 1 Pour Les Nuls_ and is reasonably up to date, informative, and easy to read.

I’d say it’s about an age 10+ reading level. \n\nEdit: Age 10+ reading level, but I’m 29 and enjoyed it - it’s really more of an all ages read. \n\nIt’s broken down in an A to Z format, covering drivers, technical terms, the history of the sport, different circuits, paddock drama and controversies, all with compelling anecdotes, an enthusiastic tone, and a good bit of humor. There are pictures, diagrams, and “fun fact” blurbs. Examples and metaphors are used to help explain the more technical aspects. \n\nI think it might be the kind of thing you’re looking for. Super informative, hits basically everything you need to know about modern F1 and how we got here, but doesn’t go so in-depth that it would turn off a young reader.']",33,12,0.91,33,10,10,-1,1,0.0,-1
