They were Sebastian Vettel, driver of the red car from 2015 to 2020, and Fernando Alonso, who had raced with the Cavallino from 2010 to 2014. Two world champions. In some ways, Sainz will remain forever linked to Ferrari, even though from January he will face his eleventh year in F1, opening a new chapter with Williams. ‚ÄòFor me the most exciting moments with Carlos will remain this year's victory in Australia, on his return after his appendicitis operation, and last year's pole at Monza and victory in Singapore.

He\'s explained why in interviews and more recently in his documentary that aired earlier this month.\xa0\n\n\nAll he meant was how his car, in one particular race (Japan 1991), was almost impossible to drive because he had damage. At turn 1 he made contact with another car and his steering buckled as a result, making the car feel heavy and very hard to turn, hence the truck comparison. Now the whole year the Ferrari already had an issue where the steering would lock in long turns and the car almost couldn\'t turn, so the steering damage in Japan must\'ve amplified the issue and felt like hell. Prost called that race one of the best he\'s ever had despite finishing P4 and 25 seconds off the podium. For the record Brundle finished P5 and got lapped, the other Ferrari\'s engine blew up on the opening lap. At the time he was also in the middle of contract negotiations for the upcoming season and Ferrari felt his comments were even more disrespectful given the situation.\xa0\n\n\nYou\'re right that Ferrari has always had an issue with accepting criticism, especially from their own drivers. Another anecdote mentioned in the Prost documentary, in 1990 (which he called of his favorite seasons in F1 in terms of team atmosphere) he brought up to Ferrari how the engine was not good enough to compete with McLaren\'s engine and the team wouldn\'t accept such criticism. He said ""at Ferrari, the engine is sacred. You don\'t touch the engine, you don\'t talk about the engine. Everything has to be about the rest of the car. Except the chassis was very good that year.""

I figure it is the kind of info which is probably casually dropped in the middle of a YouTube video, but I wouldn't know how to search for it by itself.

For context, the reason I want to know is that the Ambulance Trust I work for loves to describe our approach to resuscitation as a ""Pit Stop"" approach, where everyone has a single role and they all come together to work as a team, but I would quite like to be able to point out the next time just how often Pit Crews get to practice working as a team, compared to the one afternoon every 18 months that my trust thinks is sufficient dedicated training time.","['At the factory the teams tend to short sessions with around a dozen stops twice a day. |  \nAt the track they will do a 30 min session every day each 30 min session would be around 50 stops.\n\nRed Bull article about this: [https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en/bulls-guide-to-pit-stops](https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en/bulls-guide-to-pit-stops)', 'Idk but Talking Bulls podcast had an episode with members of their pit crew, can probably find out there', ""Some of this information is second or third hand from some personal sources, and some of it is a few seasons old, so bear that in mind.

Off-season (December - Feb/March). The crew are working almost exclusively from the factory, and the top teams will be training their pit crews for maybe 1 hour per day. Not all of that is pitstop practice, so some days may see dozens of pit stops while others might involve some strength training at the gym. For the smaller teams it will be more workload dependent, and also dependent on their facilities (not all teams have a Red Bull-style dedicated pit stop practice room). There may be weeks where the crew needs to spend time on other things and only have time to practice for 30 minutes on 1 or 2 days in a week.\n\n\n2. In-season at the Track (Wednesday-Sunday). Similar between the teams. Each team will spend 15-30 mins per day practicing pit stops. Due to travel and the time it takes to set up the paddock, there is usually no practice on a Monday or Tuesday of the race week.\n\n\n3. In-season Off Weeks. Depending on travel schedules, fatigue and rest days, the crew might not spend much time practicing back at the factory between races (the number of days in the factory will be team-dependent). At the top teams the training might be similar to off-season when the crew are back in the factory, since they have more support that lets them take time away from their normal duties. On the other hand, some top teams will offer their crew more rest days between events as a perk, so the practice volume might be very small. For the smaller teams, who don't have as many staff and so rely more on the trackside staff to fill in when they're back, it will be heavily dependent on their workload.

We‚Äôve all watched ‚ÄòDrive to survive‚Äô and some of us enjoy a good old documentary‚Ä¶.

I was 9 when I first saw F1 and being a Brit I was drawn in by the emotions of a win by a British driver at a time when so many drivers from other nations were so strong and capable. Statistics said it had been 10 years since our last British champion so I was hopeful that I could see a new winner soon.

As a child and still to this day, ‚ÄòOur Nige‚Äô is still my all time favourite. 

This documentary brought all my emotions back, feels very similar to the day I heard ‚Äòis that Glock?‚Äô

Why did Ferrari sign him for 96?\n\nIt seems most people at the time felt there were better options for the Ferrari drive, but I have not been able to find any in-depth analysis on why Ferrari chose him. Was it simply that he was the best driver willing to sign a contract to be #2 to Schumacher? I feel like I have read/heard somewhere that Ferrari wanted to keep Berger but that he didn‚Äôt want to be Schumi‚Äôs team-mate.\n\nThe likes of Hakkinen, Barrichello, Frentzen and Coulthard all seemed to have better reputations than Irvine but I wonder if Ferrari looked at Eddie and saw a strong personality who wouldn‚Äôt be mentally fazed by Schumacher‚Äôs presence, and would instead just get on with the job as best as he could. \n\n2. How do we rate him overall? \n\nI ask this mainly in the context of his comparison to Barrichello. After a messy ‚Äò94, Irvine was very closely matched with Barrichello in ‚Äò95 and he seemed to mentally destabilise Barrichello a bit, or at least that is the general consensus and one that seems to be corroborated by Eddie Jordan himself.\n\nHowever, Barrichello went on to be a much better #2 to Schumacher than Eddie was. I said in my recent post on 1992-2003 that there seemed to be two versions of Eddie at Ferrari - one was a great competitive spirit that could take points away from Michael‚Äôs rivals and the other was miles off the pace. \n\nHowever, he started off at Ferrari with a car that was not particularly good and reportedly had very little opportunity to test in his first year or so at Maranello. How much do we think that skewed things against him? It seems to me he improved throughout his time at Ferrari and largely fulfilled his potential in ‚Äò99, albeit the main factor in putting him on the verge of a title was the numerous mistakes and mechanical failures for Hakkinen & McLaren that year.', ""Hey guys, I'm not sure, but I think Red Bull and Sergio may have agreed to part ways.
