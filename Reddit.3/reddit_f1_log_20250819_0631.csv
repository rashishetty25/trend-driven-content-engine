I think it has to be what if Kubica didn’t injure himself and actually went to Ferrari in 2012? Could have Ferrari won the constructors in 2012 with an Alonso-Kubica lineup?

Not to mention that following his death, Colin Chapman took a long time to recover, and if anything Lotus underperformed for several years in terms of the innovation they were so good at in that era. \n\nIt's hard to imagine Jim being happy to race basically the same car for 5 seasons so I can't believe Lotus would have stuck with the 72 for as long as they did, despite how good it was - so had he lived in sure there would have been something better coming along in 72 or so and perhaps even something like the Lotus 78 would be ushering in the ground effect era a few years before Lotus eventually did it in 1977.\n\nOnce Jim died, drivers were just employees to Colin Chapman, whereas Clark was a major force within the team, pushing it forward always.

I get that F1 is the top of the food chain, but WEC is usually the next fastest series. Just wondering which era/year they were the closest in lap times or overall pace.

And bonus question: with current-gen LMP1s, which generation of F1 cars could they realistically beat?","['The “closest” an LMP1 has ever been to an F1 car was with the 919 Hybrid Evo at SPA, but the car ran unrestricted, lighter and with different aerodynamics from the ones used in the WEC. \n\nThat said, the most likely answer for when both series were closest to each other is from 2015 through 2017. That’s mostly when LMP1s peaked and F1 hadn’t developed the crazy aerodynamics we saw from 2018 onwards. \n\nI don’t think there’s a way to fully compare an LMP1 to an F1 car, mainly because qualifying isn’t important in endurance racing and the cars are setup and driven in a particular way, different to non-endurance cars.', "" 2014 It was one of the slowest F1 seasons in a long time and the LMP1 cars were monsters.\n\nBut still, in Spa F1 had a 10s faster fastest lap.

By way of comparison, LMP1 were even faster than IndyCar around Circuit of the Americas whereas LMDh is about four seconds back. \n\nIf you\'re asking when *sports cars* and F1 were closest, rather than WEC or its predecessor series, you\'d actually be looking at Can-Am - a ""mere"" North American regional series rather than a ""world championship"". Both ran at Watkins Glen in 73, and the Can-Am pole time was a second quicker than the F1 pole. \n\nIndy is about 10% slower than F1, which is probably about early 90s F1 speeds I think as a comparable?

The unrestricted Evo version of the 919 was then able to go a bit faster than the 2018 F1 cars.
