He became the first Argentine F1 driver in 23 years when he debuted with Williams in 2024. It only took him two races to then become the first Argentine points scorer in the sport since 1982.  
  
More than a year since his incredible breakthrough, and now racing for Alpine, Franco tells Tom Clarkson the incredible story of how a boy from the outskirts of Buenos Aires reached the pinnacle of motorsport.  
  
Franco remembers the sacrifices he made by moving abroad as a young teenager to pursue his dream, the challenges of leaving his family and living on his own in a different continent, and how an unexpected visit from an F1 legend inspired him to keep going.  
  
Franco also talks about how his experience at Alpine compares to his time at Williams, what his relationships with teammate Pierre Gasly and Alpine Executive Advisor Flavio Briatore are like, and his future in F1.
