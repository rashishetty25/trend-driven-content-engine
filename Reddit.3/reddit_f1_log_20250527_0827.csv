That was actually really cool and I hope they do that type of shot in more races. That’s how they should use drones if they do plan on using it more\n\nBut I still think they should either scrap or rotate Monaco with Spa since they’ve already confirmed that’s a thing. Fundamentally cars can’t overtake here and mandating more pit stops won’t fix it. The only stakeholders who like are the sponsors, winner of the race, organisers of the race and the VIPs who attend\n\nEveryone knows it’s garbage for racing. Don’t forget this is a race with a significantly shorter total distance than that’s required as well. Imagine adding 14 extra laps to it if it didn’t get an exemption for the race distance\n\nUnless they decide to race in go karts or everyone has an allocation of water balloons they can use', 'I know it\'s stupid but I hate how every single barrier has a sponsor on it.

What a stellar drive. I wouldn't say he was faultless but his drive essentially gave him the victory. The qualifying lap was also worth shouting out as well, though. While I do feel like I am unable to tell how this speaks for Norris's future qualifying sessions considering this is rather track-specific, and the TD *(which shouldn't affect them, per their statement but i'll watch closely either way)* is arriving next week, this is what was needed for the weekend \n\nI say that because as much as the race was still somewhat loose by the seams in turns of entertainment value, it takes a different kind of approach to ensure that you stay afloat in Monaco. With attention to all drivers in this regard, I doubt it is as easy it looks. Verstappen did what he had to do, as a competitor, by bunching up the field, leaving Norris to the pressure cooker that is by ensuring Leclerc stays behind and ensuring nothing happens to warrant a crash. Yes, Leclerc wasn't going to get past him *(in looks to the radio that Norris was slow, now we know it's because he was bunched up)* but that is the challenge, innit? I imagine that keeping your head on your shoulders while remaining patient and focused are part of the parcel of being a well-rounded driver, and if you rise up to the task, then hell yeah!\n\nI want to show my appreciation for Piastri too. While this is not the best of weekends for him, he kept it consistent, slightly playing defense towards the end, and he brought the podium back to Woking. Like I said, it may sound pedantic to suggest otherwise, but it is easy to get it wrong in Monaco if you are not careful, so the fact he kept it solid was good! \n\nChampionship gap's getting narrower once more. To that, I say, I commend both the McLaren boys in keeping respectful while pushing each other in the pursuit of maximizing the results. I'll repeat myself: this team has an amazing driver line-up in their hands with two fantastic and talented drivers in their own regard. I'll speak for myself here but it is easy to forget that this is such when title battles are at play, and at the end of it all, if there is a show for a tussle and it is all under good strides, then I'm probably the biggest winner of them all"", ""Pretty much everyone agrees that Monaco has the best qualifying of the year and the worst racing of the year. So instead of trying to fix the race with things like 2 mandatory pit stops, why not double down on the part of the weekend everyone actually likes?\n\nI think the Monaco GP should become a time attack event instead of a race. Move FP1+2 to Saturday, skip FP3, and have an extra-long qualifying session in the race's time slot. Use a similar elimination format to normal qualifying sessions (maybe with 5 rounds instead of 3?) and award points using the same system as the races (ie.  25 for pole, 18 for 2nd, etc). The finishing order of the race is mostly determined by qualifying anyway, so this is just cutting out the middleman."", ""For the record, I think the two-stopper added at least some unpredictability to the race, which is at least an improvement over the debacle we had last year. I do think more experimentation is required to actually produce an exciting race, and I hope the sport's management is willing to keep trying new things. There has to be a way to make Monaco worthwhile in the modern age"", 'Just posted this in another thread but I wanna hear what people think\n\nOne thought I had during the Williams/Mercedes debacle: when Antonelli went straight through the chicane and passed Albon, what was stopping him from simply staying ahead, taking a penalty, and backing up the field while Russell served his drive through and pitted twice?
