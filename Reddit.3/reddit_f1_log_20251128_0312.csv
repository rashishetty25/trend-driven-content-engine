1p8292y,McLaren claim FIA to investigate potential rule change after Las Vegas disqualification,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p8292y/mclaren_claim_fia_to_investigate_potential_rule/,2025-11-27, News,,"['I genuinely like F1’s hard line drawn on technical rules.

You can’t blame them for that.', 'Andrea Stella:\n\n>The specific cause that led to the situation was the unexpected occurrence of extensive porpoising, inducing large vertical oscillations of the car. The level of porpoising was exacerbated by the conditions in which the car operated during the race, and it was not anticipated based on what we had seen in practice and based on the predictions of the car operating window in the race. Based on the data we had acquired in practice, we do not believe we took excessive risks in terms of ride height and we also added a safety margin for qualifying and the race, compared to practice, in terms of clearance to the ground. However, the safety margin was negated by the unexpected onset of the large vertical oscillations, which caused the car to touch the ground. The porpoising condition that the car developed in the race was also a difficult one to mitigate, as even a reduction in speed – an action that, in theory, should increase clearance to the ground – was only effective in some parts of the track but in others was actually counterproductive.', ""TLDR: It wasn't a risky setup choice, the car was porpoising excessively, and they don't expect to have similar trouble in Qatar or Abu Dhabi"", 'Tldr: they were disqualified for excessive plank wear.', ""I'm still struggling to understand why there's suddenly a porpoise issue.
