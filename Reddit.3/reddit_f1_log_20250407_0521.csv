In a race where there just wasn't a lot of overtaking, that qualifying effort on Saturday was massive.  Put him in a position where all he really had to do on Sunday was hold serve, and he accomplished that despite some cars behind him that were faster on paper.

Super proud of Ollie for the work he put in and the result he accomplished.  It's only 1 point, but it's the only point Haas managed this weekend and the fight in the midpack should be pretty intense, so that 1 point may really matter at the end of the year.  

Either way, it shows that the kid is learning.  Last year he needed other drivers around him to make big mistakes in order to steal points for Haas.

It was hilarious. Its like Jacques is trying to actively not tweak in his seat listening to Crofty's takes.

Although Villeneueve seems like he's a little stuck in the days he used to race in F1, I find his takes very insightful race craft wise (wdc afterall...), more than Crofty at least. And his opinion refreshing. I may not agree with him on some but it's refreshing to see a clash of opinions.

One instance during the last few laps: Crofty was like ""what are mclaren doing, let piastry pass lando to challenge max so we can finally have some racing"" and Villeneueve was like ""yeahh.... no he shouldn't, I wouldn't have lol. Every point counts individually, its champion mentality""

We saw how close the gap was when Norris and Verstappen came out of the pits. 

Max would need to pick up the pace to defend both Norris from behind and the overcut from Piastri, significantly damaging his tyres during the earlier rounds of his 2nd stint.

Scenario 1: With the pace that Oscar had, he might have won the overcut over both frontrunners - resulting in more points for McLaren.

Scenarion 2: Piastri drops back behind both frontrunners after his pit. With the better tire management on the McLaren cars Norris would have been able to attack Verstappen in the later stages. Maybe even Piastri has a look, considering he was faster in the overtaking parts of the track. - again, more points

Whilst the delta wasn't massive newer tyres were quicker. \n\nHad either McLaren run longer then they'd likely end up behind Leclerc & Russell at a minimum and maybe Kimi or Hamilton if they adjusted their strategy in response. \n\nWhilst the McLaren was a quicker car the overtake delta is massive and dirty air a large hindrance. The time loss in passing these cars would have been significant and Verstappen would be managing the gap accordingly. \n\nNorris would be unlikely to comply with moving over as well. \n\nFurthermore, there was zero evidence that any tyres were destroyed in this race. \n\nI don't see how McLaren could have done anything to affect the outcome.

But McLaren had to defend against George Russell in the Mercedes.  \n  \nMcLaren also believes in the George WDC run. üôè', 'Translation and full article:\n\n> McLaren\'s dominance has been broken thanks to Max Verstappen\'s victory at the Japanese Grand Prix. How did the world champion\'s success come about, and what role did the asphalt play? We answer the most important questions about the race in Suzuka.\n\n> **What was the significance of qualifying?**\nThe celebrations at Red Bull were already loud after the time trial on Saturday (April 5). Max Verstappen had put the RB21 on pole position thanks to his fabulous lap. McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri were left empty-handed. What no one could have predicted was that Saturday\'s result would also be the result on Sunday. All experts had assumed that the McLarens would better exploit their strengths in a dry race due to less tire wear.\n\n> But that didn\'t happen. Team principal Christian Horner summed it up after the Grand Prix: ""I can\'t remember any overtaking maneuvers. Almost everyone finished in their starting position. It was a flat-out race from the first to the last lap."" The Englishman praised his star driver: ""That was one of the best weekends of his career.""\n\n> Another crucial factor was that, with very few exceptions, he never allowed his pursuer, Norris, into the DRS window. Horner knew the reason: ""He was particularly strong at the exit of the chicane before the start and finish. He had already secured pole position there yesterday.""\n\n> On Friday\'s practice session (April 4), Red Bull was still in the woods. Sporting director Helmut Marko called it a ""bad car."" But massive setup changes paid off. The car hit the window just in time for Q3. From that moment on, the world champion delivered. Marko enthused: ""He parried all the attacks, was on the limit for 53 laps, and didn\'t make a single mistake.""\n\n> The only time things got tense was when Verstappen and Norris changed tires at the same time on lap 21. Red Bull\'s pit stop took longer than McLaren\'s. Verstappen and Norris exited the pit lane almost level with each other. While accelerating, Norris tried to overtake, but Verstappen didn\'t give in, and Norris briefly skidded through the grass.\n\n> The Englishman immediately complained over the radio, and Verstappen countered: ""He drove into the grass of his own accord."" The stewards did not initiate an investigation. After the race, Norris also had a different opinion, at least publicly: ""I think that\'s racing. And Max would have been the last driver to make way voluntarily anyway.""\n\n> Christian Horner explained why Verstappen\'s stop took too long: ""We wanted to adjust something on the front wing. But that didn\'t work and cost time. It also caused more understeer.""\n\n> **Why did McLaren bring in Piastri first?**\nRed Bull was fortunate that McLaren didn\'t attempt the undercut with Norris. Instead of pitting the second-placed driver first, Piastri was given the hard tire on lap 20. From that moment on, Red Bull knew that Norris would be pitting a lap later and ordered their driver to pit as well. At first glance, it would have made more sense to favor Norris in the fight for victory. But McLaren had to defend against George Russell in the Mercedes.\n\n> The Englishman had already pitted on lap 19. Mercedes calculated that the undercut added 1.5 seconds per lap when switching from the medium to the hard rubber. Piastri also had difficulties with the medium compound. ""I was already within the window to stop and also had some graining on the front tires. We did that to cover the guys behind me.""\n\n> **Why were there so few overtaking maneuvers?**\nWhile Verstappen\'s victory puts him just one point behind championship leader Norris, McLaren was unhappy despite finishing second and third. Team principal Andrea Stella was annoyed by the fact that they had laid new asphalt in the first sector and from the chicane exit at Suzuka. Combined with the hardest tire set available, which Pirelli had brought to Suzuka, there was hardly any tire wear. ""It was a race with almost no tire degradation, and that hurt us because we couldn\'t play to our strengths in that area,"" Stella explained.\n\n> Sauber veteran Beat Zehnder took a different view. ""I wouldn\'t say it should be blamed solely on the new asphalt. We also had the hardest tire compounds available here."" The Swiss driver can imagine that results like those in Suzuka will lead to a different approach from the tire supplier. ""Perhaps Pirelli will bring the softer compounds to Japan next year.\n\n> Zehnder also provided another reason for the few place swaps: ""When you look at how close the field is, overtaking maneuvers become almost impossible. After ten laps, the entire field was only 17 seconds apart."" The overtaking gap is simply too small. The Mercedes strategists spoke of a 1.2-second gap needed to overtake.\n\n> **Why didn\'t McLaren swap places?**\nThe race was like a procession. McLaren could have spiced things up a bit, though. Even in the first stint, Oscar Piastri seemed a bit faster than his teammate Lando Norris after the initial phase. However, there was no exchange of positions.\n\n> Even towards the end of the race, it seemed as if Piastri could set a faster pace than Norris. The Australian therefore asked on the radio if he could be allowed to pass so he could try to attack Max Verstappen.\n\n> McLaren decided against it. Team principal Andrea Stella explained: ""Oscar was barely faster. That wouldn\'t have made any difference. As soon as the gap was within a second, the turbulence from the dirty air was too great. The same would have happened to Oscar."" Red Bull Sport Director Helmut Marko said mischievously: ""We would have swapped. But McLaren has the Papaya Rules, and they\'re their own rules.""\n\n> **What was going on at Ferrari and Mercedes?**\nUntil qualifying, George Russell had been considered McLaren\'s main challenger. But starting fifth, his race was essentially lost. He couldn\'t get past Charles Leclerc in the Ferrari. The aforementioned undercut didn\'t work. Russell ran into Yuki Tsunoda in traffic. Leclerc controlled his opponent after the only stop. Russell\'s teammate, Andrea Kimi Antonelli, finally closed in on the team leader. This was due to the long first stint on the medium tires. The Italian was then able to take advantage of the significantly fresher rubber.\n\n> Lewis Hamilton crossed the finish line in seventh place. The record winner had started on the hard tires. Ferrari team principal Fr√©d√©ric Vasseur explained the reason: ""It was due to the starting position. Lewis was only eighth. We didn\'t want to send both drivers into the race with the same strategy.""\n\n> The Frenchman was once again forced to face critical questions after an average weekend. Ferrari is too far behind its rivals. ""We\'re missing two to three tenths of a second in qualifying. In the race, it\'s even more. We\'re talking about three to four tenths."" However, the mixed start to the season hasn\'t led Vasseur to resort to impulsiveness: ""We don\'t have to and won\'t change our approach from last year."" However, he held out hope for a miracle: ""You\'ll never improve by three to four tenths in one fell swoop.""', '*I curse the asphalt down in Suzuka*', 'Why was Suzuka even repaved in the first place? The asphalt looked perfectly fine last year and that is with the tons of local racing and track days!', 'So then Red Bull says: ""Kiss my asphalt""', ""Bringing Lando in on the same lap as Max was such a wasted opportunity. They should've pitted him first and try the undercut, or go long like Antonelli did. If Oscar got in the way they could swap places like they did in Hungary."", 'I curse Max Verstappen. Simple too good for that bunch of amateurs.', ""The asphalt thing is pretty interesting because that was my theory on why China and Japan were more difficult for McLaren, it's not just because of dirty air (since in Zandvoort or Baku last year McLaren was able to pass even with dirty air) although that played a part still. McLaren seems to only pull out big advantages at the end of stints where the tires are falling off a bit. Both China and Japan had resurfaced tracks and a relatively cool race day with  rain falling beforehand making the track too friendly on the tires for that fall off to even happen.\n\nSo far, McLaren was only able to pull a pace advantage at the very end in China (although Lando's brake issues prevented something interesting), and right at the tail end of the medium stint in Japan. And that's because there's so little tire deg that McLaren's advantage doesn't really form. I also have a theory that Lando seems to be able to run better at the end of stints when tyres are beginning to fall off, and not having that advantage also neuters his driving style more which is friendlier on the rear tyres.""]",71,41,0.85,71,140,140,2,0,0.0,2

I wasn't able to witness the 2012 season but I've heard that the fact Massa massively struggled with that car shows how bad that car was. However, wasn't Massa clearly past his prime at that point? Especially since the 2009 accident?

Looking at the results of 2012 and the second half of 2024, Massa and Perez were pumping out fairly similar results. Is out-of-prime Massa still a lot better than 2024 Perez? Maybe the F2012, and RB21/20 aren't THAT bad but the lack of results just came from the fact that the second driver is either washed (Massa, Perez) or too young (Lawson, Tsunoda)?

On another note, if Max drags this car to at least P2 in the WDC standings, would this be on par with Alonso's 2012 performance?","['The F2012 is not as bad as people claim.

Suzuka was a total snoozefest with barely ANY passes the whole race. The cars just couldn't get close enough in the dirty air and the whole thing was just a train from start to finish.

And the safety thing is getting scary now tbh. That practice crash when the DRS didn't close in the first corner? Could have been way worse. And remember Ericsson at Monza few years back? His car literally took off when DRS failed! How is this still a thing???

The biggest problem is how stupidly inflexible DRS is. You can ONLY use it on straights for ""safety"" but then we get crashes anyway lol. So at tracks like Suzuka where the best overtaking would be from Spoon through 130R, we can't even have DRS there! Makes flowing tracks completely useless for racing.

IMO we need push to pass instead. Let drivers use extra power ANYWHERE on track, make it strategic. Give them like idk 10 uses per race and let them figure out where best to use it. Would be way more exciting than this stupid DRS that just makes one car zoom past another on a straight like it's not even there.

F1 keeps trying to ""fix"" DRS by adding more zones or whatever but it's just putting bandaids on a broken system. Did anyone actually enjoy seeing a bunch of DRS trains yesterday? The whole field was just stuck and couldn't do anything about it.

I'm not the only one that thinks this right? Anyone else totally done with DRS at this point?","["">That practice crash when the DRS didn't close in the first corner\n\nit didnt close for a reason.
