1gjhquu,2024 Brazilian Grand Prix - Day After Debrief,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gjhquu/2024_brazilian_grand_prix_day_after_debrief/,2024-11-04, Day after Debrief,"Welcome to the Day after Debrief discussion thread!

Now that the dust has settled in Brazil, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post-race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyze the results.

Low-effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will be deleted. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

While I undertand Max' career isn't over or 'complete' yet, who do you think has the bigger legacy? Who of these two is the greater driver, and will go down in history a such? And why?

Statiscally, Max has more wins than Seb, whereas Seb has more poles than Max. Max holds a lot of the 'youngest' records, but Vettel stil holds the youngest WDC record. Both hold a decent amount of other records as well or at least are close (Max' ten win streak vs Seb's nine win streak) etc. Both have had iconic drives, wins against the odds and utter domination.

He even bodied Russell at Silverstone as soon as it started raining but now he can\'t drive in the rain anymore? Give me a break.\n\n\nThe fix is in.

The nature of F1 and Mercedes have previous. They did this to Hamilton against Rosberg in 2016 with reliability and the ""faulty"" clutch.

I just want to clear up a apparent misunderstanding of how the red flag actually benefited Verstappen in today's win. 

It all starts in lap 27 when Hulkenberg got stuck somewhere on turn 1, after the rain got increasingly more intense. Norris already asked a few times to be pit, since the intermediates from the start are getting more worn for most of the grid, which means less grip and a harder time for all of them to keep the car on track. 

# Lap 28/29 

Both of the leaders dive into the pit to try and get a cheap pit stop under the VSC conditions.

https://preview.redd.it/itpieu32bryd1.png?width=2472&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed0a709e49f502ae77a817621aa7253fc60bc945

Gap back to Verstappen is about 19 seconds under the VSC conditions. Gap in racing conditions before the VSC was called was about 13 seconds. As seen in the photo, the VSC was ending when both of them came into the pit. 

# Lap 30 

Both of them have pitted, but notably they have both pitted on new intermediates instead of wet weather tires. The gap is now 13 seconds in favor of Verstappen. During all of this the rain intensity is at the peak of the race, and the conditions would call for wet tires, as shown by Tsunoda. He was about 17 seconds back from the lead pair at the point of pitting. He did however pit himself and at lap 30 he was already only 7 seconds back. 

https://preview.redd.it/4npm87owcryd1.png?width=2438&format=png&auto=webp&s=a445efc8f6f9dedb410d3ddcf976266c4ba36dc6

About 10 seconds after the above screenshot a safety car is called, since the conditions are about to be undrivable. Tsunoda in a timespan of about 10 seconds made up 4 whole seconds on his wet tires.

# Lap 32 

After a few laps behind the safety car, Colapinto find the wall and the Red Flag is called. The order under the red flag does not change.

# So how did the red flag benefit Verstappen? 

(This is the opinionated part, so please discuss if you think different) 

  
The real benefit of the red flag to Verstappen and a lot of the grid behind is obviously the free pit stop. However, the positions from Norris and Russell are arguably already won when they decided to pit under the VSC for new intermediate tires. 

If the red flag, or safety car had not been called they would have lost time to anyone that pitted for wet tires. Its in my opinion very likely that they would have had to pit again under the conditions we have seen, and with the wet tire runners so much faster. 

If there was only the safety car called, Verstappen would be in front of them anyway. In this case I think a few different things could have happened depending on the rain intensity. Whats most likely is that Verstappen would have tried to stay out as long as possible on his old intermediates, unsure if they can make the whole race, but it would have been interesting to see, especially since it would have taken a long time to clear enough standing water for a rolling restart, so I think the remaining laps under speed would have been about \~30 laps, but probably less, since it was raining a lot. 

In any case, I think the red flag was not the deciding factor for Verstappen today, but Red Bulls and Verstappens choice to stay out and not switch tires. 

Norris and Russell got new intermediates, so that was a gamble from them on a safety car as well, since there was no way to drive on anything other than wets at that point, and they would be dropped behind Ocon, Gasly and Verstappen. Really unsure what that strategy call was. 

Love to hear corrections and your input, good night to everyone going to sleep!

There seems to be multiple people and sources saying there was ""long time"" between crash and Verstappen dropping out of top 10. Rewatched to confirm. First picture is moment yellow flags are thrown out (graphic isn't even fully shown yet), second one (1 second later) shows Leclerc making into top 10. Only thing Max lost here was p11 to p12 and he already has +5 grid penalty. Biggest loser here was Bottas who was robbed since Albon and Lawson got their times done (Albon when time left 1:09, Lawson when time left 1:03).

Tldr: no, there was less than 1 second for stewards to react for red flag which is basically impossible. Red Bulls dropped because they left themself last.

I'm also on the side that it took them too long to react (50 seconds).","['It doesn’t matter that Max didn’t get through, that is bad luck they all experience.

This accusation is, after the end of the 2021 season, potentially justified. However, the discussion has been doing an incredible disservice to the fact that the past few seasons have been an ongoing showcase of a potentially dangerous slowness to deploy Safety Cars, Virtual Safety Cars, or red flags. To educate myself and (hopefully) the rest of the subreddit, I went back and reviewed very SC/VSC intervention so far this season and made note of how long it took the race director to make the decision and neutralize the race. 

  
TL;DR up front, because this is going to be long; the average time this season between an incident occurring and a VSC or SC being deployed is a whopping \*48 seconds.\* 

  
Quick methodology notes up front: I used the very helpful [list of safety car interventions this season](https://www.lightsoutblog.com/every-safety-car-f1-2024/) by Nick Haldenby at Lights Out Blog, and went back to each race with the F1TV feed, the live timing, and a stopwatch. For cars that stopped alongside or on the track, I started the clock at the point when the car stopped moving (assuming that they wouldn't want to intervene in a race if a driver can quickly get moving again). Twice this season we've had VSC's deployed due to debris on the track, at Miami and Austria -- I've chosen not to include these as they would skew the average time calculation. So, here's the list:

  
Saudi Arabia, Lap 6: Stroll into the barriers, 50 seconds

Australia, lap 17: Hamilton stops on track, 20 seconds (from the moment of stoppage -- he did spend a long time trying to limp the car back)

Australia, lap 58: Russell into the barriers, 12 seconds

Japan, lap 1: Albon and Ricciardo collide, 23 seconds (race red-flagged)

China, lap 22: Bottas stops in the runoff, 1 minute 37 seconds (this was the incident reposted today of him exiting his car while standing at the end of the braking zone, under only yellow flags)

China, lap 27: Tsunoda and Magnussen collide, 15 seconds

Miami (sprint), lap 1: Norris and Stroll collide, 58 seconds

Miami, lap 29: Sargeant and Magnussen collide, 24 seconds

Monaco, lap 2: Perez/Hulk/Magnussen collide, 39 seconds (race red-flagged -- had to open Perez' onboard for this to even figure out when the crash occurred)

Canada, lap 25: Sargeant into the barriers, 40 seconds

Canada, lap 54: Sainz and Albon collide, 27 seconds

Azerbaijan, lap 50: Perez and Sainz collide, 1 minute 35 seconds

Austin, lap 2: Hamilton into the gravel, 53 seconds

Mexico, lap 1: Tsunoda into the barrier, 41 seconds

Brazil (sprint), lap 22: Hulkenberg stops on track, 2 minutes 2 seconds

  
The fastest reaction was a mere 12 seconds in Australia, while the longest came yesterday at 2 minutes and 2 seconds. However, that does still leave our average time at 48 seconds for this season. I did not take notes on every incident's on-track battles, but did notice that they didn't seem to favor one team consistently throughout the season. Without inside information that I doubt we'll ever see, it's impossible to know whether the delays are coming from a communications issue, a lack of confidence, or a desire to leave it as late as possible so the racing can continue (a la the old ""Racing back to the caution"" rule that NASCAR rightly did away with in the 2000's). Regardless, this is very clearly an ongoing issue, going back years, Taking longer than 60 seconds to make the decision for intervention should be a rare occasion, and yet we've had 3 such incidents this season.

  
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to do the same analysis for the 2023 season yet, but I would like to. Without a convenient pre-made list of SC and VSC interventions, it's a bit more work, but if people would like me to I'll happily keep working on it (I might do anyway, just for my own curiosity). 

  
In parting, this specifically came out of my frustration at seeing people saying things like, ""any other race and they'd have sent the VSC out right away,"" when I clearly remembered this being a pattern of behavior from the officials. It's good to be aware of the potential for issues like that, but in situations like this where driver safety is being potentially placed at risk, it detracts \*HEAVILY\* from a very real, very concerning pattern. ","['Quality post and effort OP. This also reminds me of how long race control took before deploying a safety car back at Baku 2021 for either Stroll or Verstappen’s retirement when their tires randomly blew up. I remember after the race it was found that multiple drivers ignored the double waved yellows in that section by going significantly faster, yet in the end no one got a penalty for it. This has consistently been an issue like you said.\n\nEdit: [This article goes into further detail about how long it took for the Safety Car to be deployed for their crashes, and mentions how Masi wasn’t satisfied with how some drivers failed to slow sufficiently for double waved yellows](https://www.racefans.net/2021/06/09/eight-safety-questions-raised-by-azerbaijan-grand-prix-crashes-and-f1s-reaction/)', 'I saw that hulkenberg was moving (in neutral presumably) after the start of the double yellows. \n\nWhen did he stop moving? Was it a huge gap between him stopping completely and him getting out of the car?', ""I'm a marshall at Monza and I will try to explain why there's usually a long delay from the incident to the actual decision\n\nFirst of all a marshall has to report the incident to the race director to asses the conditions of the track and the driver, it's not so easy to do from the camera feed but a marshall that is right there at like 10m or less can easily evaluate the situation better.\n\nThen the circuit race director has to translate what is being said (because for us we communicate in Italian but the FIA race director understands English) and the FIA race director has to make a decision\n\nKeep in mind that usually as long as the car it's still limping around and the driver is not out they won't ever give out a VSC or a SC because it's always better to just wave a double yellow and let the driver bring the car to safety\n\nIn cases like Australia I highly doubt that there was even some sort of communication between the track marshall and the race director, they gave the VSC too quickly so I suppose the fia race director decided without hearing the marshalls (and rightfully so, I'm not blaming the decision it was the right thing to do)\n\nBut at the end of the day there's a lot of communication between the track marshalls and the race director then again between the two of them. Then the decision is given out which in turn takes another few seconds\n\nIt's never as easy as on TV you might think it is, and also trust me a race director does not want to use a SC or a VSC (while on the FCY they are more favorable because it's a lot better)\n\n\nAlso it's worth noting that if an accident happens like at turn 1 but all the cars are already past that point they will tend to wait for the sc/vsc, because marshalls might be able to remove the car in like 20/30 seconds without having the need to deploy a safety measure. In case the sc/vsc is deployed they will let them race up until almost the end of the lap so they get a bit more action before having the race neutralized"", 'The worst thing is if I’m remembering correctly even there fastest of 12 seconds was to slow considering the scenario, Russel was upside down in a high speed section with debris up in the air blocking vision of Russel, so within that 12 seconds  a car almost drove directly into the underfloor of russels car, a red flag should of immediately been thrown out in this situation, it’s just not good enough and unfortunately seems like it is going to take another fatal accident before they tighten up these calls.', 'Agree this is a quality post! What I don’t get is why the VSC cannot be deployed right away, even for just a few seconds, when something is clearly happening at the track. Almost as a swift replacement for double-waved yellows in most situation. Then full SC can be deployed within 30-60 seconds if deemed crucial. That was the whole point of introducing the VSC: not to have all the issues and instances OP rightfully brought up!', ""I watch a lot of feeder series as well, and the thing I note in both places is that sometimes flags or safety cars or other things aren't called until they imminently need to be called for safety. What I mean is that if the accident happens at turn one, and in two seconds all the cars are past turn one before anything could possibly be called... well, the cars won't be back around to turn one for more than a minute, sometimes much more depending on the track. So, often I think officials let it go for a bit so that we can get some more active racing while they aren't actually near a hazard. In several feeder series, they are much more likely than F1 to not call a safety car of any kind if some yellows or double yellows around one area are sufficient, and then they are active racing around the rest of the lap."", 'Do you also know the average time without the 2 minutes and 2 seconds from yesterday?

But I feel like, wouldn't they have done so if it was possible by now? I think it comes down to spray. By the time the conditions are wet enough that the intermediate doesn't work anymore, there is too much spray for the drivers to see. That's why the FIA have done some experimenting with wheel covers today reduce spray enough for the drivers to see, because until that problem is solved, it's kind of a moot point. Thoughts? 

Edit: to be clear, it's not like I think this is some new revelation. I just wanted to make sure I'm not missing something.","['Problem is that wet tires are made for conditions that are red flagged anyways. Drivers want a tire that is in between intermediates and full wets.', ""This gen in general is unable to race in really harsh conditions. The ground effect is the main reason. it creates awful amounts of spray by sucking up water and chucking it out behind it. Remember. Those cars can suck up heavy manhole covers with ease. Then on top of that they run incredibly low which can cause the entire floor plank to aquaplan at high speeds. Both of these factors would make the wildest rain tyre useless. The current rain tyre probably is fine enough for displacing a shit ton of rain. 80 litres per second I think. Which is a crazy amount. Drivers really hate it because they offer so much less grip (duh) than the inters. So even if Pirelly would come up with a magic tyre that offers awesome grip, life and water displacement, You'd still have cars floating up and a fuckton of spray. Which both mean that there is absolutely no shot of them racing in harsher conditions.\n\nEdit: simply raising the car would cause them to have even less grip due to absolutely castrating your main downforce source. The floor."", ""The spray and conditions being two much for the cars when the wets are needed is one thing, but the fact of the matter is that they are incredibly slow. Even in utterly horrendous conditions like the middle of the race yesterday, russel and lando were switching onto new inters because the wets are just not good. Their useable window right now is not when they are faster than the inters, it's when the inters may as well be slicks.

1gi5jfq,"So, what's actually in the rules if there is no qualifying session?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gi5jfq/so_whats_actually_in_the_rules_if_there_is_no/,2024-11-02, Discussion,"We've all heard different things from different commentators, so I went and checked the text of the [Sporting Regulations for 2024](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_1_-_2023-09-26.pdf) and, surprisingly, I couldn't find anything that deals directly with a qualifying session being cancelled.

The closest thing I could find is the rule about drivers that are not classified at the end of a qualifying session (39.4.b):

>Drivers will be considered to be “unclassified” in the following circumstances:

>i) If they got eliminated in Q1 or SQ1 and their best session lap exceeded 107% of the fastest time set during that session, unless the track was declared wet by the Race Director.

>ii) If they failed to set a time in Q1 or SQ1, or if all their laps were deleted

>iii) If they got disqualified by the Stewards from the Qualifying session or sprint shootout

Unless this is covered by some other rule that I didn't see (if so, apologies for wasting your time), if there is no qualifying session no driver could set a time and therefore they all are under circumstance (ii), to which the following applies:

>The relative classification of such drivers will be determined as follows:

>\- Drivers who are unclassified because of conditions (i) or (ii) will be allocated the top positions in accordance with the order they were classified in P3 **(or, in the case a Sprint Session is scheduled, P1)**

If I understand correctly, then it has to be Free Practice 1 classification order and the commentators that mentioned the possibility of Stewards using a different order are incorrect. I wonder if the rest of Rule 39.4.b is the cause of this misunderstanding:

>The participation of unclassified drivers in the remainder of the Competition will be determined in each case by the Stewards, who may exceptionally consider parameters such as:

>\- A suitable lap time being set in another practice session  
\- The general performance of the driver in previous Competitions of the Championship  
\- The gravity of the offence which caused the driver’s disqualification

which is about allowing drivers that did not classify at the end of the qualifying session to start the race and not about their position in the grid if allowed. Usually drivers are allowed to start the race unless there are serious driver / car performance or safety concerns.

Did I miss something?

Final note: the Rule on moving the qualifying session is quite straightforward, basically the Race Director and Stewards can do whatever they want (inside FIA rules) based on Rule 15.3.a:

>The clerk of the course shall work in permanent consultation with the Race Director. The Race Director shall have overriding authority in the following matters and the clerk of the course may give orders in respect of them only with his express agreement:

>a) The control of free practice, qualifying session, sprint shootout, sprint session and the race, adherence to the timetable and, if he deems it necessary, the making of any proposal to the stewards to modify the timetable in accordance with the Code or Sporting Regulations.","['Fuck knows', ""the truth is there is no precedent. race director will make the final call if the qualifying doesn't go through.\n\nalthough i personally feel if the weather is bad enough for there to be no qualifying whatsoever then it is really ambitious to hope for a race to happen as well."", ""Stewards discretion seems to be the most likely option but teams will protest for sure. It's going to be a hot mess.\n\nAlthough it probably won't matter looking at the forecast"", ""Time for Verstappen to pull a Hamilton '21\n\nWe're here for it"", ""Logical answer: sprint quali grid\n\nProbable answer: some FIA moment ruling that hasn't been thought of makes FP1 the race grid session."", ""You did not miss anything i think, there is no rule yet.\n\n>if there is no qualifying session no driver could set a time and therefore they all are under circumstance (ii), to which the following applies:\n\nThat is the question. If quali doesn't happen at all, does that mean that all 20 drivers failed to set a lap time during Q1 in the sense of this regulation? I don't think it has to be seen that way if Q1 never started and the stewards could use a different order.\n\nFor next year the rules in this situation would be WDC order."", '""If they failed to set a time in Q1 or SQ1""\n\nThey didn\'t, the -did- set a time in SQ1.

>Maybe we can start with the VSC fairly early in the race, pitting under that, the red flag that followed, of course. Can we get your take on that? 

>Yeah. You can change your tires under the red flag. It's what the others did.

>So just unlucky. Unfortunate. Sometimes it just goes your way. You know? So, nothing we did wrong.

>I don't care what people say. Staying out was not the right thing to do. It shouldn't have been red flagged. But, obviously, there was the crash in the end which caused the red. So just that's life sometimes.

If my mum had balls she\'d be my dad""', '*""where it becomes undoubtedly clear""*\n\nThen what ""talent"" are we talking about here? Lando starts by saying they were unlucky, but then doubles down by saying ""they"" were lucky and ""it\'s not talent"".   \nAlso, the interview is from the post-race show F1tv, which is on Youtube. (but seeing how he said it might make it worse for you, lol). \n\nJust to be clear, I think they can all say whatever they want and people should not be offended so quickly.', 'He is absolutely right but worded horrifically', 'These guys are PR trained, have people hired specifically to tell them what to focus on and not to say but he still says “it’s not talent, it’s luck”.

The context in question does not make him look any better, and that is down to some poor choices of phrasing \n\nAllow me to elaborate: I understand the quote is largely about the timing of the red flag, and there is some truth to his statement, but if I were to go off on his statement alone, whose talent is it that he is referencing? \n\nThe Alpine boys? That makes the situation ten times worse because it insinuates that they got their podiums solely based on the gamble that they took, and not because they are able to keep their race relatively clean in their own regards. Same goes to Verstappen for his win. The tone and phrasing rubs people the wrong way and understandably so.\n\nI usually stick up for Norris whenever I can, I don't believe he has ill intentions and I understand that adrenaline runs high because one is coming off from a high stakes race. At the same time, his phrasing could have been more neutral, at worst. Quotes like these puts him through the ringer, and I hope he and his PR team are aware of that to some extent"", ""His choice of words was poor at best.\n\nHe definitely didn't say or claim what people are claiming, but then again it wasn't well thought out.\n\nLook at how leclerc, hamilton or am spoke of rivals on track in the past.
