The championship team feared McLaren might lodge a surprise complaint that could see all cars with protective skids disqualified. McLaren, having avoided this solution from the start, had no intention of protesting, as they were unaware of the ambiguity in the rules.\n\n> Ferrari was not appeased. ‚ÄúSix days‚Äô notice was extremely short,‚Äù lamented Vasseur. The primary issue wasn‚Äôt raising the car slightly, which Ferrari‚Äôs SF-24 could handle due to its wide aerodynamic tolerance. The bigger concern was excessive wear on the unprotected mounting screws if the car bottomed out on the track, potentially violating the millimeter-rule. Gaining reliable data and performing tests under Free Practice conditions left little room for adjustments.\n\n> Ferrari briefly considered ignoring the directive. With written FIA approval in hand, the stewards would have little grounds to disqualify them if a protest occurred. However, Vasseur ultimately decided against it, unwilling to fan the flames in the Constructors‚Äô Championship battle. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre better off focusing on ourselves.

- Loading spinners for ages when opening stories.

No app is perfect, and I don't want to shit on developers. But to wait multiple seconds for page transitions to load a news story is not cool. It's not network latency; this happens regularly on my home wifi on the west coast of the US with fiber internet.

Releasing something that has some rough edges is fine, we've all shipped a turkey here and there with the intent to make it better. But this hasn't gotten better in years and it's not some niche experience which is hard to trip over.

Although at the time Sergeant was the only American driver in F2, the comments make it seem like none of us had much confidence he'd make it. 

With Logan now out and the US still a massive and expanding market for F1; I thought it would be interesting to ask again. Frankly, this time it seems even less obvious who it might be.

I see the options as:

* Jak Crawford - The best placed American in F2 (currently 5th), with links to Aston Martin. However, frankly, I think its unlikely Aston would put him in their car.
* Juan Manuel Correa - Sadly will perhaps always be best know for being part of Hubert's tragic crash.
* Max Esterson - Stepping up to F2 next weekend, but does not have great results over the last few years.
* Ugo Ugochukwu - Unlike the last time I asked when there were 5 Americans in F3, there is only Esterson this year and so far only Ugochukwu confirmed for next year. He is perhaps the most exciting US prospect having won Macau last weekend and being a long-term part of the McLaren junior programme. But like Bortoleto would he need to go elsewhere to get an F1 drive?
* Colton Herta - Still fairly young Andretti driver who could come across with them?

Again, an honourable mention to Pato O'Ward who grew up in Texas but was born in Mexico - who drives for McLaren in Indy but has expressed an interest in coming to F1 before. Nowadays, I'd see him more as a possible stand in for a F1 race in the Americas if Lando or Oscar were injured. ","[""If Colton wants the drive.
