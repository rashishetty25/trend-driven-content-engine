But the measurement here wasn't the car not being good enough, it's just that Zhou did bugger all in 3 years and was consistently slower than his team mate. When your car isn't good enough to score points without some wicked luck, your team mate is your performance measurement / comparison."", 'Ferrari not being no. 1 is a damn joke', '>Esteban Ocon is a downgrade from Hulkenberg but still a safe pair of hands for Ayao Komatsu’s team.\n\nHaha what? A race winner and 4 time podium sitter is a downgrade?', ""Don't really care about those rankings but it always shocks me how Piastri is being overrated by the media. What has he done to be considered a better driver than Gasly/Ocon for example? Even the worst version of Hamilton is still better than current Piastri. \n\nData shows that most of the drivers reach their peak quali pace in their 2nd season and Piastri didn't show anything special. If he doesn't magically improve this year then it's fair to say that he is not a wdc level driver."", 'Tsunoda/Hadjar above Gasly/Doohan???
