But the measurement here wasn't the car not being good enough, it's just that Zhou did bugger all in 3 years and was consistently slower than his team mate. When your car isn't good enough to score points without some wicked luck, your team mate is your performance measurement / comparison."", 'Ferrari not being no. 1 is a damn joke', '>Esteban Ocon is a downgrade from Hulkenberg but still a safe pair of hands for Ayao Komatsu’s team.\n\nHaha what?

Even the worst version of Hamilton is still better than current Piastri. \n\nData shows that most of the drivers reach their peak quali pace in their 2nd season and Piastri didn't show anything special.

No offense to either of them, just Hadjar and Bortoleto had very similar quality seasons. Hadjar had more bad luck throughout the season, so I think there's an argument he drove better, but he was a second year, so I'd give the edge firmly to Bortoleto when looking at them both going into a new car. And I place Hulk above Yuki. Hulk definitely could hit that age barrier and steeply decline. It happens to all athletes at some point."", 'I’m sorry, but what the hell are they doing putting McLaren above Ferrari?
