1lbzwpu,What time to arrive at Montreal F1 race with General admission tickets,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lbzwpu/what_time_to_arrive_at_montreal_f1_race_with/,2025-06-15, Discussion,"So I found myself asking myself this very question yesterday: ¬´¬†What time should I arrive at the F1 race at Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve for the Montreal Grand Prix of formula 1?¬†¬ª

My short answer: earlier than 6:30-7:00 am for sure, take the first metro train at 5:30 am if you really want good tickets and be ready to run in any case.

Long answer

The details:
- General admission spots are generally poor visibility unless you are right up against the fence in a few spots on the track.
- I won‚Äôt give all the details of the General Admission experience here because others have explained that well
- The metro opens at 5:30 am.
- The gate opens at 8:30 am according to the official app
- The gate opens at 8:00 am according to the official tickets

What we did:
- Showed up on the Saturday to watch the Saturday races, wander and visit the track. We basically scoped out the grounds Saturday. We did not bring lawn chairs Saturday because it would have been useless while walking around.
On the Sunday:
-Arrived at the metro parking at 6:50
- Arrived at the metro at 6:58
- Arrived on the St Helen‚Äôs island at around 7:05
- Got to the queue at around 7:10 am

At this point, there were about 2000-3000 people in line in front of us. It‚Äôs hard to estimate crowd sizes but I counted about 100 people and then extrapolated from how much space 100 people took. It was definitely more than 1500. We got to sit in our lawn chairs which was fine.

They opened the gates at 8:17 am. They were ready for 7:55 though, and the bag searchers seemed to be waiting for the green light to open the gates from higher up.

Notes: the weekend attendance for three days is normally about 350000 people, and the Sunday attendance is normally above 150000 if I remember correctly.

Some people show with the first metro at around 5:35 and camp in line, so you definitely want to be there super early.

Our experience:
We have got a team of 4 people, two running ahead with 4 lawn chairs and two not running carrying backpacks with supplies for the day. When we ran, we maybe managed to pass about 400 people. We hugged the left right after the ticket scan and then left again after getting onto the circuit to go to the hairpin. We found a spot between grandstand 46 and lance stroll in the shade for about 50% of the day.
We were in the third row of chairs (behind two rows of lawn chairs up against the fence). We had a good view of the exit of the hairpin but no view of the hairpin itself and a poor view of the trackside TV as it was East-Northeast for the track from our point of view (looking straight at the track) and it was two rows of chainwire fence so it was hard to actually see the TV. Pictures attached.

Anyhow, I would recommend getting there even earlier than we did, much earlier than 7 am, but I don‚Äôt think you can get front row seats up against the fence without taking the first train at 5:30 am sharp and running as fast as you can. I would recommend to repeat the same as what we did just show up earlier. If you‚Äôre really near the front of the line and a fast runner, I would have probably picked the spot between the Lance Stroll grandstand and grandstand 15, but there‚Äôs really limited spots there.

Our experience was good, but overall I would suggest you pay more to get grandstand tickets in the hairpin. The issue we faced though was that they were fully sold out except for 1 grandstand and we bought them day 1, so we settled for general admission. I assume this is because they offer last year‚Äôs ticket holders to buy tickets before the official ticket sales and resellers and ticket selling companies buy tickets.

The pictures provided are basically from our POV","['This is a great post.\n\nI‚Äôm a bit sad that general admission is now so poor in terms of viewing - I am sure it was better a few years ago when I did it a couple of times. I am not sure if this is all because there are more people but I feel like they have deliberately made it harder to see anything by putting up more screens etc.', 'You should share this on r/GrandPrixTravel too, really useful information.', 'Nice work, I‚Äôm glad you made it there!\n\nI‚Äôve been the grandstand to your right before, back in 2012. The weekend grandstand pass was about $380 CAD‚Ä¶.I dread to think what it costs now.\n\nI personally wouldn‚Äôt want to do what you are doing unless it‚Äôs dirt cheap, and I imagine it isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been to the Indy Toronto multiple times and it‚Äôs way way cheaper, with access to the indoor pit building for not very much.', 'ho wow, you guys are allowed to bring lawn chairs with you?! that must be nice.', ""Man for me is weird that there's general admision for a F1 race, in Mexico there's no general admission every seat is numbered."", 'General admission is a really poor experience most of the time, unfortunately', '> I am sure it was better a few years ago when I did it a couple of times\n\n\nIts actually still better than a decade ago. Before, GA holders could only roam around from the hairpin to the fanzone. Access to anything closer to the to start finish line needed the right GS tickets. At least now you can roam around at the back straight and wall of champions.\xa0', 'Bit of B, but also attendance, at least in EU, is up massively. This is 2016 Barcelona, empty stands in the best areas when tickets used to cost a fraction of what they currently do https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/4jqtd3/lots_of_empty_seats_at_a_prime_viewing_spot/', 'My buddy who went years ago, said it was much better before they put in the Lance Stroll grandstands.', 'I guess I‚Äôve been lucky! I remember showing up mid morning and having a decent view near the hairpin, or on the back straight. I‚Äôve also wandered around looking at the garages before and after sessions, close enough to take photos of drivers and Ted and Martin. I‚Äôve never noticed not having access to anywhere but I don‚Äôt think I was there before 8 years ago.\n\nGrandstand is a great experience but I wish the more affordable GA option (still) allowed for a view of the track.']",75,18,0.89,75,93,93,1,0,0.0,1

>""While¬†the¬†drivers¬†were¬†aware¬†of¬†where¬†the¬†incident¬†was,¬†they¬†could not¬†have¬†known¬†if¬†emergency¬†equipment¬†or¬†marshals¬†were¬†being¬†dispatched¬†onto¬†the track,¬†and¬†so¬†have¬†to¬†proceed¬†with¬†caution.""

The drivers were pretty much a cross section of abilities and experience levels across the grid, and all got a warning:

* Antonelli
* Piastri
* Ocon
* Leclerc
* Sainz
* Gasly

Clearly, this only goes to show that at the end of an exhausting and hard fought race, tired athlete drivers at the pinnacle of motorsport are every bit as human as the rest of us.

Still, the FIA is correct about what the rules around overtaking under yellows/VSC/SC are  (even after the chequered flag), and why they exist.

Yet, this does make me wonder whether some of the drivers had simply released themselves from the rules of the track in their minds because they simply flipped that mental switch that says that the race is over? After all, the yellows were still waving, and the big electronic flag boards were reading ""SC"".

I also find myself wondering if it was wise to bring in the safety car just before they crossed for the chequered flag? It was clearly brought in earlier than it would have been had there been racing laps left to go, as there were back markers that hadn't been released from the queue yet; though I'm not clear about *why* it was brought in early. In the international commentary, Martin Brundle gave a possible reason when he pointed out:

>""... the safety car will pull in \[at the end of the final lap\], I would assume, because you don't like to see it in front of the cars for the big photo...""

If that *really is* the reason for it, despite the Safety Car still officially being out after the end of the race, I can't help wondering whether that was a good enough reason to bring it in.

Surely, if the drivers overtaking on the slow-speed post-race lap as they return to the pits was ruled sufficiently dangerous to issue them all a warning for overtaking under SC conditions, you've also got to wonder if pulling in the safety car early for a photo is a 'safety-first' approach? I can only imagine that it would only add to the impression that the race was over and encourage the tired drivers to flip that ""job done, now chill"" switch in the back of their minds as per normal?

So, what would others here think?  If a race is ending under a safety car, should the SC stay out though the chequered flag, and the reality of it is as the photos will show, SC and all... or can the drivers really be blamed if they let their minds skip a beat at low speed after a full race distance of being sharp and quick?","['FIA stupidity at it‚Äôs finest.

1lbyxoq,George Russel‚Äôs late contract extension is probably the result of the Hamilton/Rosberg Silver War of the mid-2010s,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lbyxoq/george_russels_late_contract_extension_is/,2025-06-15, Discussion,"I'm tired of people saying Toto is holding out to get Max, who would be terrible for Mercedes and their long term plans. Yes, Max is the best driver on the grid right now, but there's more to winning either championship than having the best driver. Alex Albon has a great interview about how Max always (apparently unintentionally) ends up making the car worse for the team with his own unique preferences. Putting their investment in Kimi at risk in that way would not be good for his development as a future star.

Toto himself has said that George is one of the top 3 drivers, which may mean he's top 2. Even if he is #3 in Toto's eyes, would it be worth trading a driver in his prime in terms of reaction time and experience for an uncertain #2 who you have never personally worked with? (Maybe Leclerc) Why introduce new variables when your team is already in a rebuilding phase on more than one front? From all accounts, George is an excellent strategist and leader, and he and Bottas are doing a good job of encouraging Kimi and getting him up to speed (no pun intended). George is nowhere near the point of his life where he needs to hand the reigns over, and since his days at Williams has been known to get the most out of a car.

I think the delayed contract is likely due to Toto trying to motivate George by creating a false sense of competition. Mercedes drivers Hamilton and Rosberg were absolutely pushing the limits of their talent when they were motivated by competition against one another, with Rosberg going all in mentally and personal-life-wise to get his title. Toto can't really create that tension right now while having George be a mentor to the next star. He can artificially create tension though by having George think he needs to fight for his seat or have Leclerc or Verstapoeb take over. Toto already has both George and Kimi follow Rosberg's eating habits during 2016, so I don't think this is too conspiratorial. It's either this mind game or money or easing pressure off himself from shareholders who think Verstappen is the best thing for Mercedes when he really, really isn't, at least not long term. 

And why would Toto risk losing organisational authority to Verstappen Senior and Verstappen Junior? That's not Toto's style at all.

What?', 'I think the answer is really simple.\n\nGeorge and Mercedes have likely agreed to get negotiations underway either around the midseason break or the one before the final stretch of the season. As a driver jetting around the world to race, you probably don\'t want to be distracted by negotiations when you need to focus on beating McLaren, Red Bull and Ferrari. Let alone in your first season as undisputed #1 driver. Plus, you can probably ask for a better deal once you perform -- note how George keeps mentioning his performance being his main currency and all that. Lewis, a multiple WDC was signed really late during his contract extension as well, so I think this is just the norm for how Mercedes operate (that goes unnoticed because well, their previous #1 lasted 12 years with them).\n\nThe reason there is furore is because of three things. One, people *really* want the drama of Max leaving Red Bull. Two, people want more Max/George drama because there\'s almost no vitriol on the grid. Three, Toto (unsurprisingly) is an admirer of Max, which is like saying ""humans are the biggest fans of oxygen"". Throw in F1 sports journalism that\'s often starved of content (due to how F1 is often secretive and just not full of news to cover, unlike say football or basketball), and you can see how the journalists and fans themselves create this narrative that ""Max is going to replace George at Mercedes"". It\'s a tantalizing story, even if it\'s not really sensible -- Max leaving ahead of the new regs is a gamble he\'s unlikely to take. \n\nTL;DR -- It\'s probably an agreement by both parties to leave it for later, and several plausible-but-unlikely points are being strung up to create a narrative because a lot of F1 fans care about drama over actual racing.', ""Yeah saying that 'Max will be bad at Mercedes' is for sure a clear sign to a bad take.\n\nI get that letting Russell leave after a solid season looks bad but sorry Max is not gonna flop at Mercedes if he goes there, cause a few controversies with his aggressive driving?

Especially Toto with how much he has been linked with the Dutchman.\n\nHe would fire Russell in a heartbeat if he could get Max.\n\nAlso I guessing Toto do not want another Rosberg/Hamilton Rivalry that causes a lot of tension in the team (just look how many times the two collided with each other). Toto would rather drive the car himself for a season than go insane having to deal with a Rosberg/Hamilton Rivalry: 2.0. Good for drama, not so much for results, especially going into 2026 where there are a whole new regulations and you want as less friction as possible.\n\nAnd saying max makes the car worse is such a bad take: Without Max Red Bull would be a midfield team at best with how the others performed and Max had to carry them."", 'Discontinue the lithium', ""Toto never signed Hamilton until the last minute when he was clearly the best driver still after each contract ended. \n\nHe's always done this.""]",0,44,0.17,0,299,299,0,0,0.0,0
