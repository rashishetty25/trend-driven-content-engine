Never mind the way this leads to a manufacturer being stuck with an FIA confirmed deficit that they can’t fix, we need to do this early so that Red Bull can prepare for Honda leaving. Anyway, all our new teams need to show they bring value to the support so we’re going to insist they bring a committed engine partner with them, sorry Mr Andretti but you need to get someone on board. Actually, let’s change it now you’ve invested all that money and development time - I need to say something the public likes about V10 noises and I hear some of you did a shit job on the engine regs. So like… 3 years maybe? Idk if we’ll freeze it and lock in your shit job though.”', 'Pivoting to a V10 engine so quickly after putting in new engines regs that manufacturers have sunk hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of hours into is not going to create and foster an environment for growth for the sport.

This just comes across as MBS doing whatever he can to gain popularity to retain his position.', ""Ultimately I'd love to go back to smaller, lighter, cheaper engines, but to do so half way through the current regs would be a spit in the eye to all the current manufacturers and teams who have invested time and money in what they were told the regs were going to be.\n\n\nEnd of the current engine regs, I'd say go back to high-revving IC engines with sustainable fuels, and if the major engine manufacturers aren't willing to play with that, Ilmor or Mecachrome will happily build a racing engine for anyone who contracts them to."", ""It's stupid. The regs were decided a long time ago, teams joined because of that, teams have designed engines. Too late."", ""My honest opinion:\n\n* New engines will stay until 2029 or 2030 (not before like 2028).\n* Then, they will switch to V8 NA with ERS and sustainable fuels as a compromise between manufacturers who want some sort of road relevance (Audi, Mercedes & Honda) and those who don't care it so much (RBPT-Ford, Ferrari & Cadillac).\n\nPD: As far as I know, Mercedes is open to discuss that and I think Honda too.

This still happens anyway, it's just about undercuts now, instead of overcuts. Saying the racing was bad in the 2000s because of refueling is a weird take.

Despite all the well-deserved criticism the F1TV app gets, I love watching old race recaps. The archive is a real treasure trove of long-forgotten F1 moments. I started with the 1989 season and, after many, many hours of watching, I’ve just begun the 2010 season.

There’s something so charming about those old recaps. They’re like a mini race documentary series. They featured insights about the circuit, weekend events so far, interviews, commentary on current rumors, the starting grid, and sometimes even more. They also provide important historical context.

Today’s race recaps, by comparison, feel so dull and cheaply made with the spliced up OG commentary. It genuinely hurts. Especially thinking ahead a few years, rewatching a season will give you just the race, instead of a holistic view of everything happening at the time: the drama, the fashion, the old tech, and so on.

Anybody else feel the same?","['I\'m wondering: Is it because we get SO MUCH information during the broadcast already, what is there to add in the post-race? \n\nMy family are new to F1, and the kids have been watching some world broadcasts out of curiosity, and we\'re like, ""What\'s going on?

I haven't watched those for years, but I very much enjoy the yearly season reviews that they do for BTCC and WRC, and they generally follow a similar format to what you describe, only for the entire season."", 'This is a good point! \nGoing back and watching older races for the first time, I’ve been finding myself feeling almost lost sometimes because there’s no timing tower, sometimes gaps aren’t shown on screen for what feels like five or ten minutes, etc. and I have no clue where anyone is until a commentator happens to mention it - if they do. It makes sense to me that having so much more information, both through commentary, graphics, and all the apps we have available now, would incidentally lead to less need to be told what happened after the fact for the regular fan.', ""Yes the year in review, could catch up on a year in an hour. It's great to have the full races from the 80s on, but the shorter format was ideal just to get an idea of what was going on as fan who came from DTS.

I’m beginning to completely reassess my opinion of Albon and this is mostly independent of (but definitely prompted by) how he’s doing against Sainz right now.\n\nAlbon in 2020 scored 49% of Max’s points compared to Perez scoring 48% the following year, yet Perez was widely considered to have been an improvement. As a Perez fan, I agreed with this viewpoint simply on the basis that it felt like Perez was a bit closer to the ultimate pace than Albon was. He had five podiums, lost an all-but-certain podium to late mechanical failure in Abu Dhabi, lost a probable podium in Austria to a slow pit stop, a potential podium to a VSC in Brazil and was on course for one when the rain came down in Russia. He also had some on-track battles with Lewis that made him look very good, especially in the context of RBR desperately needing a driver to play a supporting role to Max. He had some lows but the potential was there for greater things and he fulfilled that (and then some) the following year.\n\nHowever, I’m curious - how much of that was Perez simply looking better than Albon because of the context? And how much of it was down to him looking better by being in a better car? Could the optics have simply been very kind to Perez?\n\nAnother thing with Albon is he scored a whopping 78% of Max’s points in 2019, which could’ve been over 95% if Lewis hadn’t yeeted him at the finish in Brazil. Yes, Albon was massively flattered by Max having problems at Spa, Monza, Suzuka and Mexico City - some his fault, some not. It’s also worth noting that Albon was basically guaranteed at least sixth even on a bad day in 2019. But even then, Albon still did quite well. \n\nIt all makes me question - how many drivers could do what Albon did alongside Max right now? And by extension, how much is Lawson falling short of this simply attributable to a talent gap between he and Albon?', 'Is Lawson making it to Suzuka?', '\nWhat do you all think the pecking order will be of the teams at the start of 2026?

1jjmtna,"What is the psychology behind fast drivers in a midfield team, suddenly not being able to perform in a top team?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jjmtna/what_is_the_psychology_behind_fast_drivers_in_a/,2025-03-25, Discussion,"This has happened so many times in recent F1 history: a midfield driver shows real raw pace and promise, gets picked up by a top team, and then suddenly struggles to perform anywhere near the level they previously showed. Perez at McLaren and then again at Red Bull, Bottas in his first couple of seasons at Mercedes, Kovalainen at McLaren, and to some extent Fisichella at Renault—all drivers who looked seriously quick in midfield cars but just couldn’t make the same impact at the front.

Why is it that these drivers, who seem to be excelling in less competitive machinery, suddenly become mediocre?

Excluding the obvious Red Bull examples—it’s a pretty well-established fact that RBR, understandably, design their car to suit Verstappen’s unique driving style, so it’s not really a mystery why rookies like Gasly, Albon, and Lawson have struggled.

But for the others, what’s going on? Is it the pressure? Better teammates? Worse teammates in their midfield car making them look better? The car being more sensitive? Team dynamics? It just seems strange how often this happens. And on the other end of the spectrum—why do drivers like Leclerc, Verstappen, and Ricciardo manage to hit the ground running straight away?

Why do good midfield drivers struggle so much when they get into a top car?","[""Perez - Verstappen\n\nBottas/Kovaleinen - Hamilton\n\nFisichella - Alonso\n\nThe drivers you named simply aren't on the level of their new teammates, so they look bad. That's all there is to it."", ""Part of it is clearly the car. Making the car go as fast as physically possible might make it difficult to drive. \n\nMaybe some of them are overrated, too. One of the hardest things in F1 is to accurately judge a car's pace. If it comes sixth, is it sixth fastest? Maybe better drivers would take it to fourth or fifth, slower drivers to seventh or eighth.\n\nIf a driver is super quick in midfield but then slow compared to an elite driver, maybe he wasn't super quick after all. The car or teammate could have flattered him.\n\nYou can generally tell when you have an elite level driver on your hands in the lower part of the grid, like a Max, Charles, Alonso, etc. (Lewis had already proved himself at the top before the McLaren dropped back in the pack.)\n\nOf the drivers you listed, I don't think anyone expected any to be elite and thrive at the top as more than a number 2.

I was only a kid, but I remember expecting Fisichella to do a bit more, but he wasn't that great to begin with either."", ""Well, one thing to consider is that maybe the midfield car was actually better than midfield? If Red Bull had 2x Perez in the car last year it would be considered a midfield car. If we didn't see what Max can do in the same car, we would have no idea. \n\nSo perhaps the Williams that Bottas was driving before going to Mercedes was a better car than we think it was?\n\nPlus I don't know what you expected from Perez, he was quite evenly matched with Ocon. If anything, a better driver would win a few races in that Pink Mercedes in 2020."", ""I just am going to say this: Verstappen doesn't have 'a unique driving style'. He's just extremely good at adapting to any car. Even if a car sucks, he will get the most out of it."", 'Because, they are not good enough', ""It happens in other sports too.\n\nSome people aren't made to perform under enormous pressure.\n\nSometimes it's even less than that. If you get a bad start because of bad luck you might get that negativ thoughts in your head and it goes down."", 'My guess here is that those cars of the top teams in question have a very narrow operating window. In terms of aerodynamics, oversteer, weight transfer, etc. \n\nIt’s the “min-maxing” of a design in a similar way you make a very specialized character in a video game where he excels in a single context but doesn’t really shine everywhere else. \n\nSo these cars are hard to drive properly, utilizing that edge that Max can handle. If you go over the edge, you lose the car. If you go below the edge, you’re slow. Cars of midfield teams have that edge more dull, and while they are not as fast at the peak, the operating window is bigger. So you don’t need to dance on the edge as much, which results in better results from “good” drivers that aren’t good enough to master the edge.', 'It could be that the drivers in the top cars are the best on the grid. So if one of these great drivers beats another and meanwhile in the midfield a guy is doing really well but his team mate isn’t as good as people think then it seems like he’s got for a top team but then he’s actually not.\xa0', ""I think some of the top guys just have that extra capacity to always be on their A game, and that gets found a bit more in a top team than it does in the midfield. There's just more scrutiny,  so if you can't match your teammate every race your naturally not going to look as good. I remember Bottas saying something along those lines that he just couldn't do his best every weekend, but Hamilton could.\n\nIn terms of differences in a top car and midfield one, it just depends on the team and their philosophy. There's mid cars that handle like garbage and top cars that handle amazingly and vice versa. That's usually just luck of the draw. I think often when you see a big gap between teammates, thats usually when a car is tricky to handle. When it's close it's probably a well balanced car.""]",0,38,0.27,0,34,34,0,19,0.13,0
1jj06c5,Debut Down Under: Liam Lawson's First Drive | Behind the Charge,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jj06c5/debut_down_under_liam_lawsons_first_drive_behind/,2025-03-24, Video,"In 2023: Liam Lawson says his dad was never able to take him to Singapore GP so he will be taking him to the race instead

""My dad actually used to promise me every year that he would take me to the Singapore Grand Prix, and in the end, we never went, but he's going to be coming to the Grand Prix this weekend, so actually I'm taking him!""

https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/liam-lawsons-rocky-road-to-f1-my-parents-sold-their-house-so-i-could-keep-racing/10658101/

But to get there in the first place, Lawson revealed his parents made a huge sacrifice. ""My parents and my whole family really gave a lot, especially in the early years through go-karts,"" Lawson told Red Bull's Talking Bull podcast. *""My parents sold their house so that I could keep racing. It's massive. They gave absolutely everything for me to be able to race, even just go-karts because it's so expensive.""*

Like McLaren's Oscar Piastri, who lived in boarding school in the UK as a teenager while trying to forge a racing career, Lawson's perseverance was severely tested while 11,000 miles from home. But that early sacrifice often proves a formative experience for the Australian and Kiwi drivers that do make it across and provides them with the steel and grit to survive in F1's often difficult environment.

""I didn't finish high school or anything,"" Lawson shared. ""Honestly, I was just excited to be able to go and chase my dream. And there are always hard parts about it, but there was never a question of whether it was too difficult and I wanted to go home.""

But while he showed promise by finishing second in his first season in Europe, Lawson didn't get picked up by an F1 junior academy right away, and he headed back home to New Zealand's famed Toyota Winter Series without a plan after that, and with his F1 dream on the verge of already being shattered at the age of 17.

""Being from New Zealand, trying to get the money to compete overseas is really, really hard,"" Lawson recalled. ""So, between a group of amazing people that have been behind me, sponsors and investors, we set up the structure to get enough money to go to Europe and do a season and try and get recognised by a junior team, because without it, there was no chance to get a Formula 1.

""I had a good season, but I didn't have any call-ups from any teams. And then I just did this championship in New Zealand's over the off-season, with no plan of what I was doing in 2019.""As a kid being into Formula 1, I would watch this series every single year and I dreamed of driving it. And to me, it was like the Formula 1 of racing at the time.""

Fortunately for Lawson, talent scouts were watching the opening round of the 2019 Toyota Racing Series. And not just any scout, but Red Bull's Helmut Marko, who was keeping tabs on Lawson's older team-mate Lucas Auer, who was part of the Red Bull junior programme at the time.

And even before he would go on to beat Auer, and fellow Kiwi Marcus Armstrong to the title, Lawson would get the news he dreamed of for so long.

""I guess Helmut was watching because of Lucas and I had a really good first weekend,"" he said. ""When I raced in F4 in Europe, Jack Doohan was a Red Bull junior at the time and we tested together somewhere. I remember seeing him walking around in his Red Bull suit and I remember thinking how cool it would be to be a Red Bull junior.

""And I got the call-up after that first weekend in New Zealand, I found out one or two days after the weekend. I was sitting in a cafe - I remember exactly where I was sitting. I got told and it was obviously pretty emotional. I basically got picked up at the perfect time and it saved my career. I had those four weeks left of that championship, and then I had no plan after that...""

Lawson then plied his trade in FIA F3 and F2, going head-to-head with Piastri, dovetailing his single-seater activities with a Red Bull-backed stint aboard a Ferrari GT3 car in the German DTM sportscar championship, that yielded him a runner-up spot.

Finishing third in the 2022 F2 championship landed him a Red Bull reserve role alongside a Japanese Super Formula campaign for 2023, and when Ricciardo broke his wrist in Dutch Grand Prix practice Lawson got the nod to deputise for the Australian for the next five rounds.

In typical Red Bull fashion, it was sink or swim for Lawson, but he kept his head cool and scored points in the extremely challenging Singapore Grand Prix.

Lawson's cameo performances complicated matters for Red Bull in the short term, with Yuki Tsunoda and Ricciardo still getting the nod over Lawson to start the 2024 season while Lawson returned to a reserve role.

But what Red Bull was really looking for in a driver for the renamed RB team is someone who could be a future Red Bull driver. And with it becoming clear Ricciardo isn't ticking all those boxes any more, it has handed Lawson the opportunity to battle Tsunoda for a Red Bull berth.

Following his family's sacrifice to give him a fighting chance, and Red Bull noticing him just when he was approaching a dead-end street, claiming a Red Bull seat would be the third miracle on Lawson's rocky road to the top.

1jjcr23,New Netflix show suggestion,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jjcr23/new_netflix_show_suggestion/,2025-03-25, Discussion,"# The Problem:

With the support of the FIA, I think there should be a new show to complement *Drive to Survive*.

I don’t mind *Drive to Survive*, but it has become more of a drama series than an in-depth coverage of the sport. While it’s great for bringing in new fans, it has also led to a wave of social media discourse from people who don’t fully understand the complexities of F1.

Formula 1 is an incredibly intricate sport, with countless elements that make it fascinating—car design, engines, racecraft, team strategies, and so much more. Yet, a lot of new fans miss these aspects, leading to takes like this one from the past few days:

>

This kind of misunderstanding happens all the time, and it’s frustrating because these are fundamental parts of the sport that have existed for decades.

# The Idea:

A new show that dives into the technical and strategic side of F1—covering the rules, mechanics, racecraft, and innovations that define the sport.

Each episode could focus on a different aspect:

* **Engines** – The different suppliers, why some teams build their own while others rely on manufacturers, how engines are managed across a season, cooling systems, and FIA regulations.
* **Car Regulations & Innovation** – How teams design their cars within the rules, how they push boundaries, and the technical loopholes they exploit.
* **Racecraft & Strategy** – The tactical decisions made during a race, pit stop strategies, driver-team communications, and how they impact performance.
* **Behind the Scenes** – A day in the life of a pit crew member, engineers, and mechanics, showcasing their roles and contributions.

With engaging visuals, expert commentary, and perhaps even actors or F1-loving celebrities acting as the audience, asking the questions casual fans might have, this show could bridge the gap between hardcore fans and newcomers.

1jj1bnm,Lawson's speed compared to Tsunoda,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jj1bnm/lawsons_speed_compared_to_tsunoda/,2025-03-24, Statistics,"As yet another driver is struggling in the second Red Bull seat, narratives seem to be running wild that take some liberties with the nuances of formula 1. Particularly the ""Tsunoda beat Lawson at Racing Bulls"" narrative.


USA sprint - Lawson 0,029s faster  
USA - Lawson 0,456s faster  
Mexico - Tsunoda 0,033s faster  
Brazil sprint - Lawson 0,545s faster  
Brazil - Tsunoda 0,373s faster  
Las Vegas - Tsunoda 1,438s faster  
Qatar sprint - Lawson 0,017s faster  
Qatar - Tsunoda 0,047s faster  
Abu Dhabi - Tsunoda 0,053s faster

That means that although Tsunoda beat Lawson in qualifying last year, he was on average only 0,099s faster. Translate that to this year's Australian Grand Prix, and that difference still results in p19. Translate that to China, and you're still only looking at p18 in sprint/p19 in gp instead of p20.


Now don't get me wrong, the point of this post isn't to say Yuki Tsunoda didn't deserve that second Red Bull seat, or that he wouldn't have done (slightly) better. I think there's good reason to believe Yuki's experience could have made a difference. However, let's make that point based on good arguments and wipe bad arguments off the table; bad arguments such as ""Tsunoda beat Lawson at Racing Bulls"".","[""This implies that performance stays the same regardless of car or environment, which it doesn't. Sometimes a different car can unlock a drivers potential. The elite drivers will always maximize the car, but the not so elite drivers will find different results and at times not do good with a different car, both Lawson and Tsunoda are in the second group. They might do exactly the same but you never know until you see it, and Lawson is doing so bad rn that there's not many arguments against trying the car with Tsunoda."", ""I don't think you can simply take their results from a different car and apply them to the current car, even though we're still in the same broad regulations. Also, comparing this time difference between the two of them also presents it's own issues because no two circuits are exactly the same.\n\nYou'd have better luck if you compared their results as a percentage, in my opinion (though, it still doesn't present an apples to apples comparison)."", 'The only logical way to resolve this is promote tsunoda but keep Lawson and compare them both in the red bull while demoting max to racing bulls and see if he can lap the entire field in it.', ""Clearly the RB is not a good litmus test, it's too different to the Red Bull. It's about finding someone who likes similar things to what Max likes. Daniel was right there."", ""I don't think it's super relevant, as long as the numbers are close. Lawson in the second Red Bull seat could end his career if he doesn't improve dramatically. Red Bull is essentially done with Tsunoda. If the Red Bull seat destroys drivers, let it destroy a driver that they don't need next year. If they're investing in Lawson, they need him to survive the season and he is probably better equipped to do that in the junior team. Let the junior team do its job and develop the less experienced driver. Let Yuki rise or fall on his own merits. The Lawson question is answered: He can't drive the Red Bull to any satisfactory result. Now answer the Tsunoda question."", ""Can't believe this needs to be explained again, the gaps in shit cars will naturally be smaller because the ceiling is low. That means that the better driver can only get so much out of it.\n\nIf you put Max and Lawson in last year's VCARB together, Max's gap to Lawson would be less than it is now they're in the Red Bull. Why? Because the Red Bull has a higher ceiling, whilst the floor of any car is obviously infinite.\n\nThe better a car, the higher the potential. Look at it this way. You're in two different races vs Usain Bolt, a 5m sprint and a 100m sprint. You're going to be far closer to Bolt in the 5m sprint than the 100m sprint because the superior competitor doesn't have the potential to fully extract and show off their capabilities because of the parameters at hand. In this case a short distance vs a longer one, which is the slower car vs a faster car equivalent. He can however murder you as you waddle and stumble over the 100m line because there's far more potential to show off his capabilities when the parameters open up.\n\nFwiw, Lawson had a fresh PU for his spell vs Yuki last year whilst Yuki had to manage his existing PUs from Belgium onwards.You've also got to add context. If both drivers have clean sessions and put in the same number of laps on the same compound per session, then it's comparable. But if one driver has a messy session then the gap might not be pure pace but a result of circumstance, like the half second in COTA. Yuki had two lap times deleted, which is driver error, he needs to hold that, but that meant his timed lap was extremely conservative and not a completely authentic representation of his pace.\n\nLawson's quicker times here are by fractions in sprint sessions on mediums, with the updated floor in Brazil sprint (Yuki didn't have it that weekend) and the aforementioned COTA qualifying where Yuki had a stinker Q1 and then they didn't even run Lawson in Q2. Yuki did go on to actually qualify 11th for that race although he still didn't have a great lap then either."", 'none of this matters. no one is going to succeed in the second car at red bull this season. it’s toxic.', ""Speed doesn't matter, in Checos case even experience doesn't really matter.

It looked nailed on around Spa that Ricciardo would be jumping into the Red Bull, numerous reports that the Verstappen camp fully expected it and were surprised when it didn’t materialise for whatever reason. Once that decision was made the writing was really on the wall, but I don’t think anyone really expected them to pull the trigger mid season like they did. In my opinion, they should’ve given him to the end of the year and if they’d made the decision to get rid of Checo, could’ve lined up like this in 2025:

RBR: Verstappen/Ricciardo
RB: Tsunoda/Lawson

Hadjar as reserve wouldn’t have been the worst move for his career, and if Ricciardo struggled they then had the option of swapping one of Lawson or Tsunoda into the seat. A year or two would’ve been Daniel’s max stint anyway and that time to develop would’ve benefitted Lawson and allowed Hadjar his route into the sport.

The advantage Ricciardo offered was his years of experience on what by all accounts is a difficult car, and the fact he likes a pointy front end similar to Max and so set up wise they’d be more aligned. It would also give us an insight into just how far Max’s set up has taken the car, and also once and for all answered the Ricciardo question. It doesn’t massively delay any of the RBR talent pool, and they keep a veteran who’s well liked around?","['Hate to quote marko but this is not netflix, bro fell off', 'All in all, in my opinion, RBR has made a numerous of bad decisions. but our speculations are only matters of WHAT IF situations. \n\nWhat if they lose Checo, put DR in the Red Bull seat, and Lawson in VCARB last year?   \nWhat if they put Tsunoda instead of Lawson that Red Bull seat this season? \n\nAgain, these are purely speculations. We would not have known the outcome because they did not put those in place. They have all the data, but they gambled hard with their drivers, and only have themselves to blame.', 'In my opinion, I’ve always believed that it made sense to at least give Daniel a go in the Red Bull, you didn’t have much to lose \n\nIf Daniel did well then great, Red Bull have a temporary short term solution while they figure out which one of the juniors will be the next in line for the main team\n\nIf Daniel struggled then you cut him loose and he’d probably shake your hand and say thanks for giving him an opportunity\n\nRed Bull are now in a situation where they’re unnecessarily burning through their juniors and putting even more intense pressure on the next person they hope can be the solution to the second seat', 'Just let him go.', 'To some degree, yes. The issue really does seem to be that so few drivers can handle a pointy front end car. Daniel can, or at least used to. \n\nI feel like the solution should have been to try him out last year after the summer break and see what happened. Guess we’ll never know.', 'The great tragedy is he never got back into the Red Bull car for an extended run to see what was there in the tank.\xa0\n\nHe did the test, they were impressed, they wanted him back so they sent him to prove his red bull pace in a car that is absolutely nothing like the red bull???\xa0\n\nCan’t say age when there is older drivers, consistency was a factor but when you don’t mesh with the car that will be a problem. Had the same issue at McLaren still managed to win a race. \xa0\n\nThe injury obviously didn’t help his chances, but there was certainly an opportunity when the constructors was obviously lost to let him have a farewell tour at the very least before they shifted gears to Lawson.\xa0\n\nDanny is happily retired though if Cadillac can’t stir any interest I doubt this Red Bull car can either.\xa0', 'They might as well call the car a ""Mechanical Bull"" at this point because it keeps throwing off whoever is stupid enough to have a go.', ""They should've canned Perez in the middle of last season and put in Ricciardo. Would've ended this stupid debate on whether Ricciardo would fit the RBR seat or not. Lawson would've had more time in the VCARB as well."", 'Knowing that he was comfortable with and had lots of experience in the Red Bull car they should have swapped in Ricciardo for checo after spa, put Liam in RB to replace him. If Ricciardo  worked out then they had their 2025 lineup. If he didn’t, then they could’ve moved Yuki up into Red Bull and had Liam and Hadjar in RB for 2025. \n\nKind of a really simple plan that gave them several options, but I think Marko wants to look brutal and decisive, even when he doesn’t need to be..']",0,96,0.33,0,756,756,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
