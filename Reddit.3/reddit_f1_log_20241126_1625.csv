1gzqsgt,How Colton Herta is personally linked to Cadillac/General Motors' F1 entry and how he can obtain a FIA Super License to race in F1 as early as next week.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gzqsgt/how_colton_herta_is_personally_linked_to/,2024-11-25, Discussion,"**The first question may be ""*why Colton Herta specifically for Cadillac F1?*"".**

Colton Herta is a current Andretti driver, he is American, he's fast and he's a fan favorite in IndyCar. But this is not all.

Colton is personally sponsored by a big insurance group called Group 1001 and he is one of their biggest ambassadors. His IndyCar is infact sponsored by Group 1001 and Gainbridge (a Group 1001 company)

Colton got this sponsorship via Dan Towriss, the CEO of Group 1001. Dan is a big personal supporter of Colton.

This circles back to Cadillac F1 as Dan Towriss has also recently become Andretti Global's CEO after the sidelining of Michael Andretti, and he's now the lead figure behind the General Motors entry in F1.

American driver on american car would be pretty big for marketing reasons, and Colton also combines this with natural speed (never fully exploited in IndyCar) and a personal connection to a soon-to-be F1 ""team owner"".

**How close is Colton Herta to obtaining a FIA Super License?**

Colton currently has 39 points, 1 short of the 40 points needed to obtain a Super License, thanks to the special COVID-19 exception that allows drivers to count their best 3 championship placements of the last 4 years, as long as 2021 is one of those years.

* 2021 - 8 pt (5th in IndyCar)

* 2022 or 2023 - 1pt (10th in IndyCar)

* 2024 - 30 pt (2nd in IndyCar)

**How can Colton get the necessary points for a super license ahead of the 2026 season?**

There are actually a lot of ways, I will list a few:

- Taking part in a single FP1 session in the next 2 F1 weekend, he would gain precisely 1 point.

This is unlikely. With only 2 races to go and a Sprint Race in Qatar, the only chance would be Abu Dhabi, but with such short notice it's hard to imagine this being possible.

If Colton does not get it this year, then a problem arises: entering the 2025 season the COVID-19 exception would expire and he would find himself with 31 points (1 pt from 2023, 30 pt from 2024). He would lack 9 points that can obtained in the following ways:

- Finishing 4th in IndyCar he would get 10 points. IndyCar is hard and extremely unpredictable. A bunch of unfortunate crashes can make the difference between finishing 3rd or 9th in the final standings, so this is risky.

- Completing 9 F1 FP1 sessions regardless of IndyCar placement would also guarantee him enough points. A driver can collect up to 10 points by doing 10 different FP1 sessions. IndyCar and F1 however often clash, getting all this seat time is very expensive and it's doubtful there are even this many FP1 sessions available to buy from other teams.

- The most realistic scenario then becomes a mix of the above. For example finishing 7th in IndyCar and doing 5 FP1 sessions would be enough and logistically easier to coordinate.

- There is also the possibility of competing in more a series in a single year: a driver can also get points for multiple (2) championship in a single calendar year, and the FIA ladder has multiple ""farmable"" championship in the off-season. The *Asian Le Mans Series* for example is a 3 events endurance championship held between December/February that gives 10/8/6/4/2 points. All seats are filled in LMP1 for the first weekend, but maybe they can be bought out.

Overall there are many ways, some more convoluted than others and some riskier than others, but it's not unrealistic for Herta to be in the 2026 Cadillac F1 team.","['The FIA could also just grant Herta the same exemption they gave Colapinto, who was also on 39 points, and give him a super license tomorrow.', ""He just needs to have a good season in 2025 then it sorts itself out.

So if the Andretti team wasn't doing as well as expected or if they could get a better deal from an existing supplier, then GM would be able to write off or repurpose whatever engine development they had done. If I'm being charitable, then I have to say that that feels a bit misleading because Andretti's complaint was that they were being frozen out, but giving GM the option of engaging means that they weren't being completely honest.

1h0bbn0,Why is Senna's legacy so much more evident?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h0bbn0/why_is_sennas_legacy_so_much_more_evident/,2024-11-26, Discussion,"This might have already been asked and answered, but something about Senna's legacy seems to irk me somewhat.

I don't dispute his ability or achievements and that he was one of the greats, but something about the continued use of the Senna logo and references to him seem to be unbalanced in my own opinion.

By unbalanced, I barely hear any reference to Michael Schumacher these days. A seven-time world champion who suffered a life-altering accident, who is arguably one of the best drivers of all time.

What I find (rather opinionated I know) is that Senna's legacy is abused somewhat.

Will it take a similar form when Schumacher passes?","['He died on track.', 'He died racing, he was quite handsome, he made interesting quotes, he was a bit unorthodox and a spectacular driver.\n\nStatistically you can argue Prost had a better record, but his cerebral approach to racing wasn’t as fun to the average fan.', 'Died in track in a race they still run today vs injured years after retiring.  That’s the difference.', 'Because he died.\n\nAlthough there’s plenty of mentions of Michael, there’s just more of Senna at the minute because of his anniversary \n\nIt’s Prost that gets ignored', ""Many didn't grew up with Michael Jordan but still hail him as their hero."", 'Cause he died while racing and media has been pushing this ""idolization"" every year.

It took him from a legendary driver to a de facto saint. Schmuacher was permanently injured, but survived. He was also already retired when he had the injury. \n\nMaking a comparison to touring/stock cars here, it’s the F1 equivalent to Dale Earnhardt vs. Peter Brock. One was a 7x NASCAR Champion and won the Daytona 500. The other was a 3x Supercars Champion and won the Bathurst 1000 nine times. But Earnhardt died on track holding off his rivals for his son and his best friend, driving in cars he owned, to win the biggest race in stock car racing. Contrastly, Brock died a few years after he had retired, in a regular car accident. Guess who more people are familiar with.']",0,70,0.47,0,66,66,0,5,0.0,0

Emotionally (And thus PR-wise) it would be bad to cut Hamilton off the next two races. But rationally, it would make sense (or would it?).

Similarly, could Red Bull (assuming they are willing to be billed around 100 million from rescinding with Perez), put Tsunoda in there out of the blue right away, or it's not even legally possible?

1gzqpr6,Is it time for a  new points system ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gzqpr6/is_it_time_for_a_new_points_system/,2024-11-25, Discussion,"A few months a there were  rumours that the  FIA was considering changes to the points by expanding it to 12 positions by reducing the gaps from 7th--12th to one point, though nothing came out of ir

Now that Cadillac has been confirmed for 2026 , I think it's a good time for the FIA to consider changing the points system . Especially since there was a result just a few weeks back ( Alpine double podium) that exposed the flaws of the current system. Its rewards freak results from weaker teams and punishes their consistency.


I have had a system in mind that would expand points to the top 14. I think that would enough to reward consistency and protect the standings against freak results.  It goes like this

1. 40
2. 30
3. 25
4. 20
5. 17
6. 14
7. 12
8. 10
9. 8
10. 6
11. 4
12. 3
13. 2
14. 1

This points progressively increase the gap for every milestone ( top 10, top5 , podium, win). This system also more else maintains the ratios between two places, atleast within the top 5.

I would also a like a point for pole. I think it's disappointing to see efforts like Magnussen in Brazil 2024 go completely unrewarded and the fact the pole means absolutely nothing at tracks like COTA. Its far fairer than the Fastest lap point and won't matter that much when the winner gets 40 points.
