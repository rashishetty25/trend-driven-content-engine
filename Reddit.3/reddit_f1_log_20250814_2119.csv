* He becomes the first Australian since Alan Jones in 1980 (45 years of F1's 75) to win the WDC

* He wins only Australia's fifth ever WDC
* He defies his manager's Mark Webber's ""almost seasons"" at Red Bull
* He achieves it as an Australian surrounded by a British team

Even if he doesn't he is still the first Australian to:

* Lead an F1 Driver's Championship since Mark Webber in 2010
* Secure more than 10 podiums in one season (and counting)
* Secure more than 4 consecutive podiums (his 8 in 2025 matches Senna in equal P2 for Mclaren)
* Win more than 5 races within a single season

I mean about the technical side. I already know about adrian newey’s book. What other books would you recommend me? Idc about it being a boring textbook or whatever. I wnat to spend my time with this in summer. Thank you guys very much.

Btw I already tried to post to F1Technical but it didnt allow me","[""[Peter Higham's F1 Car By Car](https://www.amazon.co.uk/stores/Peter-Higham/author/B001HPO922?ref=ap_rdr&isDramIntegrated=true&shoppingPortalEnabled=true) is great - technical information and a general overview of each team and each season. It really goes into detail about how they came to the decisions they did, for example it might detail the changes that needed to be made when McLaren switched from Peugeot to Mercedes engines in 1994, or why Sauber decided to stick with an outdated engine for 2017.\n\nEdit to add: It's not super technical though, if that's what you're after. Like it doesn't have diagrams of the internals of the 2015 Ferrari turbo, or whatever."", 'Formula One Technology by Steve Rendle is probably a good one to look into. It was updated/published after the 2022 season.', 'The perfect car - biography of John Barnard. Barnard was the pioneering f1 designer of the 80s - responsible for the first carbon fibre monocoques, semi-automatic transmissions and plenty more besides. A man so talented that Ferrari had to let him run the design of their cars out of Surrey (twice!) because he simply refused to move to Italy.', ""In addition to the Newey book, which you've read, and the Rendle book (**Formula 1 Technology: The Engineering Explained)** already suggested, I am throwing one more into the mix: \n\n\\- **McLaren Formula 1, Car by Car, Every Race Car Since 1966** by Stuart Codling (wife got this for me as gift...originally was for my son, but I reminded her that I am McClaren fan in the house :)...I know it's just about McLaren, but it's a fun read)\n\nAs an aside: if you haven't read it already, I recommend **Total Competition: Lessons in Strategy from Formula One** by Ross Brawn and Adam Parr.  Ironically, I got on Reddit just no to search and see if there was a discussion on this book...it is not about cars of course, but since I come from an organizational design/operations/culture/process background, it is of particular interest to me.  Plus some great insights into what goes on behind the scenes from race, technical, and political perspectives."", 'The ""* to Win"" series by Carroll Smith.

It tells an incredible story of one of racing’s most famous examples of exploiting a rules gap for a one-year knockout blow. The book is a fun read and isn't afraid to get technical when discussing the engine."", 'It might be informative to learn about the history of the sport.  Take a look at the Formula 1 In Camera books.  They are big photo books with good captions.  There is one for the 1950’s, two for the 60’s, two for the 70’s, and one for the 80’s (so far as I know).  They are really great books with lots of shots of drivers and cars from the period before F1 became so private and secure.  Any F1 fan should have these books.  Each decade goes season by season with an overall summary of the drivers, champions, etc.  Even though they aren’t meant to be technically oriented, they will teach you a lot.', ""How to Build a Car: The Autobiography of the World's Greatest Formula 1 Designer by Adrian Newey"", 'How to build a car by Adrian Newey', ""Any of Steve Matchett's books would be good""]",22,16,0.79,22,16,16,4,1,0.040000000000000036,4
