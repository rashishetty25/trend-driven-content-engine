Driving as fast as possible with a fixed amount of energy (or fuel).\n\nFormula 1 is not an old-school racing series, but rather the tip of the iceberg when it comes to technological progress and innovation in motorsport."", ""Translated Text:\n\nThe upcoming engine regulations for 2026 haven't even seen the racetrack yet, and the FIA, Formula 1, and engine manufacturers are already discussing the next powertrain concept. Formula 1 has long debated the return of the V10. But now, a V8 engine is the favorite.\n\nIt will be a 2.4-liter V8 engine, as used from 2006 to 2013. A new feature is the efficiency factor. CO2-neutral fuel will be burned with pre-chamber ignition for fuel-saving performance. The combustion engine will be coupled with a hybrid component producing 220 to 240 kilowatts of power. The electric power would thus be halfway between the current engine formula (120 kW) and next year's solution (350 kW).\n\nAfter the Italian GP, \u200b\u200ball parties involved plan to meet for another engine summit. Two questions will be addressed: Is a return to the V8 with hybrid components the right solution? And: Should it arrive in 2029, 2030, or perhaps only at the end of the future regulatory cycle in 2031? The FIA \u200b\u200bis reportedly pushing for 2029. And it has at least two supporters, RB Powertrains and Cadillac."", ""You know what, I like it. I've always been a fan of the V8's over V10's. And I think the hybrid system provides a good layer of extra strategy to drivers. So imo it's the best of both worlds."", 'Lots of daydreaming in the comments without a hint of some reflection about reality of F1 politics involved in this topic.', ""As much as I'd prefer this, it's a bit silly to go for this ruleset so soon after the new regs come in. 2030 at the earliest.\n\nThat said...This sounds like the perfect formula imo. This is what I always wanted after 2013 - essentially a much more aggressive KERS."", 'F1 could potentially be a HUGE advertisement for fully synthetic renewable biofuels if the sport actually focused on getting closer to carbon neutrality, rather than just having marketing and press revolve around it, and going the ""easy"" hybrid route that\'s super visible. Weighing the cars down with battery packs and slapping ""Hybrid"" on things is a bandaid.\n\nYes, the big footprint is from the logistics, and with DHL as partners they\'re managing to slash the environmental effects of taking the circus around the world, but the more public focus should be on sustainable racing that\'s great to watch and is a huge spectacle.\n\nSince the introduction of hybrids the cars have become fatter, heavier, and while faster, they\'re less able to race, follow eachother and overtake. They\'re also substantially less exciting to watch than cars of older generations.\n\nAs someone who runs an EV as a daily, is hugely conscious of the environment, living in one of the most environmentally conscious countries on the planet that runs on 100% renewable energy, and is a qualified engineer and car mechanic, stop screwing around with all this hybrid stuff for 22-26 cars with emissions outputs that are a drop in the ocean in terms of the sport\'s carbon footprint.\n\nFocus on the tracks, the logistics, the manufacturing, the recycling and the travel, where the biggest savings are to be made, and let the racing be a spectacle that draws people into the sport where you can then punch with a bigger message about environmental awareness. \n\nGive awards, creditations and additional prize money to teams for hitting environmental targets and team efficiency targets. Incentifize teams to look for ways to minmize their footprint or go fully neutral. Give them something to show off as part of their branding.\n\nDo the same with tracks and give them discounts on their hosting fees if they can demonstrate they\'re running sustainably. Cover the paddock roofs and infields with solar panels and turbines - put the tech front and center on TV and show it off to the audience. Let F1 be a platform to make this kind of tech seem normal.\n\nThe racing can still be green, but it can also be loud, exciting, and highly strung. Imagine getting Shell, Total, BP, maybe even some large US players like ExxonMobil and Chevron fully involved, and looking at ways to supply fully sustainable, carbon neutral, synthetic biofuels for racing with tech that could then be applied to the road.\n\nStrip the hybrid systems away from the cars completely, ditch the battery packs and go back to smaller, faster, lighter cars that have a better power to weight ratio and are simpler and cheaper to build. Cut back on the tech and make the racing more fun again, and while yes, they\'ll use about 30% more fuel, mandate the use of 100% renewable fuel and make sure that every mode of logistics is doing the same.\n\nHell, Volvo, Scania, DAF, Iveco, Mercedes and others are all building electric trucks these days, mandate that teams have to use them for the european leg of the season to further slash emissions.\n\nPush the sport back toward naturally aspirated V8, V10, or even V12 power plants that are more simple to build, repair, and recycle than the hybrids, and change the engine allocation numbers per season to a split system - x number of physical power units with x number of permitted full rebuilds with new internals during the year, with teams demonstrating that they\'re sustainably recycling everything. \n\nIt feels like a no brainer to me to completely revolutionize the sport while keeping its core intact. The actual running of the cars and their emissions is such a small part of the issue, yet it\'s the one they\'re probing at the hardest to the detriment of the sport by making it harder to get into and hard to sustain financially when there\'s so much other low-hanging fruit.', ""Sounds like it all depends just how quickly the manufacturers are willing to move to them. Can't see them coming 29 though, just feels too early.\n\nAlso, think this will be one step closer to F1 going towards the entertainment route instead of being a tech showcase. Feels like if you want to see the most advanced tech that aligns with road mobility, thats going to be in FE, whereas F1 will be more of an aero focus championship with less emphasis on the powertrain."", ""V8 doesn't really make much sense when it comes to small displacement engines. With the MGU-H gone, Increasing the displacement of the engines while retaining the V6 arrangement makes more sense.\n\nJust loosening the fuel flow rate restrictions is all we need. Let the V6 engines stretch their legs a bit more.\n\nLets not kid ourselves here, V10s and V8s are dying tech. The manufacturers won't be cool with the idea of pouring resourcing into a project like that."", 'It’s my dream that they’ll think this way. Look at what Mate Rimac did with the Bugatti Tourbillon, it’s also a hybrid, but lighter than its predecessor. Nostalgia and emotion combined with technology.\n\nBut first I’ll see it, and then I’ll believe it.', 'Yes']",165,194,0.87,165,189,189,9,10,0.0,9

All the preseason testing all pointed towards Ferrari being THE team to beat during the season. What we actually got was Mercedes being as dominant as they've ever been. Every race up to Canada has either been an easy Mercedes 1-2, or a race where Ferrari shot themselves in the foot (Bahrain and Canada). Yes new viewers, we were all making fun of Ferrari before 2022.

The Canadian Grand Prix was one that many were enjoying during the race, mainly because as long as Vettel didn't suffer an engine blowout like Leclerc did in Bahrain, he would win the race. Unfortunately during the last ten laps or so, Vettel made an error. He went off the track, onto the grass, and rejoined the track in such a way that Hamilton had to brake in order to avoid a collision.

This resulted in Vettel receiving a five second penalty. A penalty that resulted in Hamilton and Mercedes winning yet another race. At this point in the season, none of the races were won by a different constructor, and Canada was only the second race where P2 wasn't Bottas.

I suspect this played a large hand in the massive backlash over the decision to give Vettel a penalty. Not just online, but the Sky F1 pundits, Channel 4 pundits, TV personalities, it was a wildly despised penalty. This led in turn to the FIA introducing a yellow card like system, where drivers were basically let off with a warning if they committed minor five second penalty offenses. This meant that certain driver on driver duels such as Verstappen v Leclerc at Austria and Hamilton v Leclerc in Italy resulted in the winner forcing a driver off the track and getting away with it, so the FIA quietly reverted back to the old way of doing it.

Personally speaking, I believe the only way Vettel doesn't deserve a penalty is if you don't believe that Hamilton was allowed to take the standard racing line at standard racing speed whilst Vettel sorted himself out, and nowadays the backlash has softened massively. What do you think of the penalty? Are you still mad about it?","[""What's the point of this thread?
