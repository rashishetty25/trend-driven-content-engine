And please take into consideration that I started watching F1 since 2023 mainly. 

However, to me, I feel like Fernando is an over-hyped driver. Of course, he has a sheer brilliance in terms of driving skills, but overall considering him, I feel like he gets more hype than he should be. 

He hasn‚Äôt had a single race win since 2012. Now a lot of people will blame his teams, but we‚Äôve seen drivers improving the whole team & the car. Schumacher did it, Hamilton did it as well. Red Bull developed their car around Max and turned him into a champion. Vettel also did it. However, I cannot see Fernando doing it ever. 

In 2023, he said the car feels a lot better and that car was developed mostly when Seb was in the team, not Alonso. By the end of 2023, the AMR23 couldn‚Äôt keep up with Ferrari & Mercedes. 

In his Ferrari days, the car was decent, however he still couldn‚Äôt overpower the surge of Red Bull and Seb, which is fair to me. In his 2nd time McLaren days, he couldn‚Äôt do much due to the car. In his first McLaren days, he couldn‚Äôt do much due to team preferring Lewis. However, we‚Äôre watching this season, Oscar is still on more points than Lando. 

So yeah, he did have some bad luck, maybe the worst luck as well. But the hype around him seems a little too much. Is he a great driver? Of course. Is he one of the best? In terms of skills, yes. 

However, just blaming on his luck constantly seems a little wrong. I would like to be proved wrong of course, and have a peaceful and constructive discussion. 

TIA","['Overhyped by his own fanbase but only by a tiny bit. Most casuals don‚Äôt appreciate him nearly enough because ‚Äúhe only has two titles‚Äù', 'One of the funniest things I\'ve seen regarding Alonso was Sam Collins from F1TV talking about him, I think in his first year at Aston. Sam comes on and is like (paraphrasing) ""so Alonso claimed the other day that he adds 0.5 second to any car he drives, and I kinda got upset about that cause like cmon, you are just being full of yourself. So to prove him wrong I went back and looked at his performances in his first year in all of his new teams and...he was actually right."" üòÇ pretty funny clip, if you can find it anywhere.\n\nBesides that though, I think his quali streak and overall race record against Stroll right now speaks for itself. I know Stroll is the neighborhood punching bag here, but he still has held his own against other teammates in the past, and is known to have some pretty spectacular drives on a yearly basis. To keep that quali streak in particular alive for that long, in so many different conditions, tracks, etc, is seriously impressive. His race craft is nearly unmatched too, imo. So yes, I think he should still be rated as one of the top drivers on the grid.', 'I think he‚Äôs pretty incredible. He can make a slow car fast for a lap better than almost anyone. I CANNOT wait to see him in next years car.', ""It's not possible to judge a driver accurately by reading through his results on Wikipedia. If you could understand the context of each of his results - understanding the capabilities of all the other drivers and cars he raced against - throughout his 20+ year career, you would understand why he is rated so highly."", ""He's 44 and still a 9/10 in all areas. He deserves the hype."", '>In 2023, he said the car feels a lot better and that car was developed mostly when Seb was in the team, not Alonso. By the end of 2023, the AMR23 couldn‚Äôt keep up with Ferrari & Mercedes.\n\nThis is so painfully ignorant, the 23 Aston was good because Lawrence Stroll poached Fallows and Blandin to copy last years Red Bull. It worked, Fernando got podiums but then Aston ran into similar issues that Red Bull did, but as they just copied the design they did not understand it and the car continued to decline in relative performance. The idea that Vettel was somehow responsible for this is ridiculous.', 'If anything he is underrated by some, lol. He had so many incredible drives just to finish a P8 or something\n\n\n2012 Alonso and 2018 Hamilton would be the only two active drivers who could beat max over a season\xa0', 'Sigh, so basically fuck his 2012 season ig. Which is arguably one of the best runner up season u can get in f1.', 'He is worth whatever the largest number in existence is, multipled by two, then squared.  That‚Äôs the exact amount of hype that is worthy of Alonso', 'Ferrari flair writing this thread is mad']",0,135,0.24,0,1112,1112,0,0,0.0,0
