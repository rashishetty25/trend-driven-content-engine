If you look at 4:19 you can see the whole car from overhead and it\'s the only year where the nose would look like that.\n\nFor some reason BMW published a guide to the steering wheel at the time seen here: [https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/photo/detail/P0016281/williamsf1-bmw-fw26-steering-wheel-07/2004?language=en](https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/photo/detail/P0016281/williamsf1-bmw-fw26-steering-wheel-07/2004?language=en)  / Direct link to hi-res: [https://i.imgur.com/OtwVknA.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/OtwVknA.jpeg)\n\n  \nAs you can see they did have a switch called ""FSC"" but this is simply labelled as ""high speed engine braking"". I suspect the explanation in the video is a misunderstanding, I\'m not certain but I cannot believe auto throttle would have ever been allowed.', 'Maybe they meant traction control', 'That\'s the BMW Group Classic collection in one of the historical factory buildings in Munich, it\'s a pretty awesome collection.\n\nI wonder if they\'re really just describing some sort of drive by wire throttle with an adjustable limit, i.e. the driver can choose to have the throttle pedal really work with 0-95% range, then regardless of whether they are at 95-100% throttle, the throttle is treated as full open. BMW and many manufacturers offer this on their road cars today, with sport modes they adjust the throttle map to make the pedal ""feel"" more sensitive by reducing the actual range.', ""So thinking about it, I could absolutely understand a button that changes throttle map to effectively ignore a driver's foot lifting on the pedal and keep full throttle being useful for bumpy tracks. \n\nIIRC this was around the era (2000s) when F1 electronic driver aids all got a bit crazy. There was even automatic downshifting alongside TC and launch control. Overriding the physical throttle position would not have been unusual to hear."", 'That was correlated to GPS, and only worked @ eau rouge, Spa‚Ä¶', 'From the era of blown diffusers? \n\nIf I remember rightly people would be on the throttle through the corner as the exhaust was routed through the rear diffuser to generate more airflow and therefore grip. Although BMW may have been gone by then.', 'You could try on r/F1technical', ""From what I gather this is to help stop rear wheels locking.  IE, you are hard on the brakes, rears lock up and the engine hits the throttle to get the rears spinning again.  It's probably pre-emptive in a way and you might want this to happen at varying speeds and amounts.  Just like it's got 3 settings for diffs and you can control the TC as well as the yaw induced as well.\n\nIt could work in the opposite way as to how strong the engine braking itself is.  Not really sure and I could find anyone explaining the engine braking of the williams."", 'That engine was so shit that it probably did both at the same time.']",28,18,0.72,28,72,72,3,0,0.020000000000000018,3
1gla42c,"[Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team] Why Did We Pit During the VSC? | 2024 S√£o Paulo GP F1 Akkodis Race Debrief  (Summary in comments: VSC, Brake issues, Setup differences, Tyres pressures and penalty, COTA upgrades, W16) ",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gla42c/mercedesamg_petronas_formula_one_team_why_did_we/,2024-11-06, Video,,"['(I might start doing these summaries weekly, let me know if you\'re interested and if anything can be improved)\n\n\n\xa0- Q: Acknowledging hindsight, would the team manage Russell\'s strategy differently?\xa0\xa0\n\n\nA: Once they announced the VSC was ending, they had a very short window (1 or 2 seconds) to tell George to stay out so as not to suffer a full pit stop time loss. Prior to that stopping made sense as Norris also stopped and George would have still come out on fresh tyres ahead of all the cars behind.\xa0 Shovlin says normally they try not to assume that it\'ll get red flagged because if you stay out and don\'t get a red flag, you\'re in trouble. Sometimes you get it right, sometimes you get it wrong and this time the cars that gambled got what they wanted.\xa0\n\n\n- Q: What were the issues with the brakes that both drivers complained about?\xa0\n\n\nA: George said the brake disc felt like they had ""warped"" but they didn\'t. There can be higher friction in some areas that can create vibrations that the drivers can feel through the pedals. They are still investigating but think it could be due to the very cold temperatures, as the brakes were fine in the dry and other drivers also complained about brake vibrations during the race. George thinks it was costing 2 or 3 tenths a lap.\n\n\n- Q: Lewis was particularly struggling with the car. In general how challenging is it to make sure the setup suits both drivers\' demands?\xa0\n\n\nA: Normally you\'re able to do it, they let the drivers deviate with the setup, evolve their own setup and when one of them appears to be going well you often take some elements or even the whole lot and put it on the other car.\xa0\n\n\n\xa0Lewis was mainly struggling with rear grip, in the sprint for example he had snaps of oversteer, which overheats the tyres and prolongs the issue. The difference between the sprint (hot and dry) and the race (cold and wet) made it difficult to get the car where he wanted.\xa0\n\n\n- Q: What about adjusting the tyres pressure on the grid and the subsequent penalty?\n\n\nA: When they got the message for the restart, there was only 10 minutes to go, and the tyres must be on the car with 5 to go (serious penalty if you break that rule says Shovlin). The pitlane layout in Brazil is unsual and makes more difficult for teams to get the car. The tyres they selected hadn\'t been ""bled down"" to race pressures and the penalty was because there wasn\'t time for the FIA checks.\n\n\n$5,000 fine per car, no rules around tyre pressures were broken and no sporting advantage was gained, mitigating factor of not having enough time to bring the tyres and get the checks done.\n\n\n- Q: Did the COTA upgrades perform as expected?\n\n\nA: In terms of loads measured, they\'re seeing what they expect and where they expect in terms of ride height range. In the wet the car worked well in quali (front row) and in the race, particularly the first stint with George. However in the dry they have issues in slow speed, particularly when one corner follows another and a lot of turning is required.\xa0\n\n\nThe aim of those upgrades wasn\'t to fix that but to lift the base performance of the car, which is what they\'re doing. They know they still have some fundamentals to tackle in order to fix them on the W16, which they\'re very busy with at the moment.\xa0\n\n\n- Q: What learnings for the W16 and how will the team prepare for the rest to the season?\xa0\n\n\nA: The main weakness has been the same, the interconnected slow corners like sector 2 in Brazil. They\'ll keep working on that in the next races. The final three races will be useful to assess performance, determine who is the benchmark between Red Bull, Ferrari and McLaren and establish the gap that needs to be closed down over the winter.\xa0', "">W16\n\nFeels like yesterday the W13 was porpoising down the Bahrain straight, and now we're close to meeting the W16. Time flies..."", 'So Shov seemed to just blame Hamilton\'s performance on a bad setup when Hamilton stated it was the worst car he\'s ever driven in these regs. \n\nAt this point it feels like they must just be told what to say by PR before doing these things, they say a lot of words, yet nothing ever makes a lot of sense. \n\nIt\'s unfortunate, as these used to be very informative videos that were exciting to watch to get a glimpse of what actually goes on behind the scenes. \n\nGuess it got old saying, ""We still don\'t understand how our car works, our upgrade\'s wind tunnel/sim correlations don\'t ever match our on track performance.""', 'I really call BS with merc getting away with a slap on the wrist for the tire pressure thing. Sure it‚Äôs not really that big a deal but it‚Äôs the rules and all the other teams managed it', ""Why is everyone saying George has the old spec even if according to the team he doesn't? Genuine question"", 'If they tried to up the performance base without solving the issue the previous upgrade bring, I am not sure this is the correct path for development this generation of cars‚Ä¶', 'Thank you for the write-up', ""I don't think he blamed Lewis more like gave excuses instead of getting at why exactly was there such a difference in performance and added the weather made it unpredictable.\n\nYea after they got a sponsor these debriefs have become a bit sanitized ngl, they used to be quite upfront a couple of years ago."", 'Shov didn\'t blame him, if anything he\'s being nice to Lewis and blaming primarily the weather conditions and lack of practice due to the sprint week-end format.\xa0\n\n\nBoth drivers are given freedom regarding their setup choices and data is shared between to the two of them. Lewis and his engineers got it badly wrong, it happens. McLaren also got it wrong, putting so much downforce on their car that they were useless on the straights, and seemingly not even better than Max\'s RB in the corners. That change took them from best car on Saturday to barely second best above Merc in the race. Red Bull\'s work did the opposite, going from very good in the sprint to great in the race, that coupled with Max\'s ability and confidence (and a bit of help from the red flag) and there wasn\'t much doubt after that. Clear air was also massive, neither George nor Lando could overtake the other, even an Alpine was pulling away from Max at some point.\xa0\n\n\nLewis is also notorious for chasing the perfect setup and pushing hard even in practice sessions, which makes him nearly untouchable when it works and gives him confidence in the car. But his approach doesn\'t really work with these unpredictable ground-effect cars with narrow performance windows, especially with the Merc cars having even tighter windows than their competition.\xa0\nGeorge seems happier to ""settle"" for a good setup but nothing more, as a tiny change can take the car from good to great but also from good to undrivable. ""Perfect is the enemy of good"" and it\'s surprising that someone with Lewis\' experience and talent hasn\'t understood (or improved on this) after 3 years of stable regulations. The good news for him is that it should get better at Ferrari as their drivers rarely ever complain about setup issues and performance swings from session to session. The bad news is that Leclerc is even better than Russell and will have a 3-year head start on Lewis with the ground-effect Ferraris, while George and Lewis spent the same amount of time in the Mercs.\n\n\nRegarding understanding their cars, it\'s no secret they\'ve struggled more than most but even the better teams have. Red Bull turned their ultra dominant car into the second or third best depending on the track, even as low as fourth in Monza. McLaren looked consistently the best but didn\'t have the best car on Sunday this past triple header (Ferrari quicker in US and Mexico, Russell slightly quicker in the first stint in Brazil and Max much quicker in the second half).\xa0\n\n\nFinally regarding their upgrades, they\'ve been asked each week the past 3 races if they were performing and they keep saying their data showed exactly what was promised in the wind tunnel, so there are no correlation issues at the moment. In Austin interview, Lewis said the upgrades worked (not implied or questioned, said). George said it, the engineers said it and the data shows it, what more do people want? Their upgrades were just aero, they have other issues like their occasional suspension stiffness and constant rear axle overheating. Remember in early 2022 a lot of you thought the Merc PU was weak cause their teams all struggled but we\'ve now seen after 3 years that HPP is still as good as ever. People have to stop blaming one single thing and accept that it\'s a multifaceted problem and drivers can also carry some of the blame (look at Perez or Stroll regularly making their car look much worse than it actually is)', ""Hamilton has been a bit shit in ground effect cars. That's the reality of it. They're physically extremely demanding to drive and he's nearly 40 now. Alonso has similar issues.\n\nYears 1 and 2 they were working the car around his wants. So minimising bouncing and getting the ride height as high as pos. Year 3 he is leaving, so they're focusing on what George wants. Results are obvious.""]",28,23,0.75,28,127,127,3,0,0.020000000000000018,3
