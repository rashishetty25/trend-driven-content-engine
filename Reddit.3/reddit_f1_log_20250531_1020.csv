1kzdi10,[AMuS] The big wing quake doesn't happen,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kzdi10/amus_the_big_wing_quake_doesnt_happen/,2025-05-30, News,,"[""Yeah, it hasn't shuffled the field that much, but long stint pace are not conclusive (as in article), race will give us better picture i think."", 'Translation:\n\n> **The race for the world championship title remains tight between Max Verstappen and the two McLaren drivers. The stricter front wing regulations haven\'t rocked the Formula 1 world. Mercedes and Ferrari have moved somewhat closer.**\n\n> We don\'t need to rewrite the Formula 1 World Championship. The stricter front wing regulations haven\'t upset the balance of power between the teams. McLaren is still ahead, both on a single lap and in the long run. Max Verstappen is close. This has to do with the fact that Barcelona is a Red Bull track. The hope that stiffer front wings would upset the balance of the papaya racers was not fulfilled.\n\n> Mercedes has rediscovered its form from the first six races. But only for one lap. During the long run, the tires overheated. Ferrari delivered a solid performance. The gap to the leaders was half a second, slightly less than last time.\n\n> In the midfield, Aston Martin performed well on a single lap and Alpine on the long run. Toro Rosso showed the most balance. Their speed is good both on a single lap and over the distance.\n\n> Sauber has made a noticeable leap forward with its new aero package. Nico Hülkenberg\'s strong endurance run underscores that the Sauber has become more predictable. Williams, as expected, is struggling. The car doesn\'t thrive in the long corners. Haas had the same problem and plummeted to the bottom of the standings.\n\nSix things you need to know:\n> **1) Has the new front wing rule shuffled the field?**\nNot at all. On one lap, McLaren is ahead of Mercedes, Red Bull, Ferrari, Aston Martin, Alpine, Toro Rosso, Sauber, Williams, and Haas. That\'s almost normal. Aston Martin looks slightly better than recently, Williams slightly worse. That depends on the track. Sauber and Alpine have made a leap with their upgrades. Haas adjusted the setup in the wrong direction after a strong first practice. On one lap, Mercedes is a pole position contender. But the Silver Arrows suffered a setback in the long run.\n\n> **2) Who has the fastest car in the long run?**\nWhen comparing the long runs, much depends on the time in the second practice session they were completed and the distance they covered. George Russell drove the longest stint on soft tires with 16 laps. Piastri was the marathon man on the medium tires with 14 laps. We only count the fast laps without cool-down periods or time lost due to traffic. The length of the race simulation logically puts pressure on the lap times. This is why Russell and Norris are far down in the standings.\n\n> Max Verstappen and Lando Norris are difficult to compare. Both completed a long run on the soft and medium tires, but at different times. Verstappen started on the medium and then switched to the soft. Norris did the opposite. Therefore, the world champion was faster in the soft long run, while Norris was faster in the medium endurance run. The difference was three to four tenths per lap. Taking the weight factor into account, it\'s a close race. The second stint was obviously helped by the fact that there was less fuel in the tank at the end.\n\n> The Ferrari drivers split their time in sync. First medium, then soft. Lewis Hamilton leads the soft long runs. However, he only completed three hot laps on the set. Oscar Piastri took the fastest time of the day, but suffered a setback in the endurance run. In 14 laps on the medium tires, the Australian only managed an average of 1:20.966 minutes. ""Things didn\'t go well in the first practice session. It wasn\'t until the second that we slowly found our way back to form,"" he said.\n\n> **3) Ferrari: Good or Evil?\nAfter the first practice session, Ferrari\'s faces were relaxed. Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc finished third and fourth, surprising even themselves. Barcelona hasn\'t exactly been one of the red cars\' signature tracks in the past. In the afternoon, with temperatures of 31 degrees Celsius in the shade, the corners of their mouths drooped again. Leclerc slipped to fifth place, half a second off Piastri\'s fastest time.\n\n> Hamilton, finishing eleventh, didn\'t even make the top ten. The Englishman complained about the car\'s balance. ""It was a confusing day with good and bad moments. But I think the final setup changes on Saturday should help us."" Leclerc expressed his positive surprise: ""It was a positive day. In the heat, everyone has less grip. That\'s why it\'s difficult to assess the cars\' true potential. But I feel like we still have something up our sleeve with our car.""\n\n(1/2)', 'While I agree the flexi wing clampdown won’t have much impact on the overall running order, I do think it’s a bit premature to say “nothings changed” when we’ve only seen 2 practice sessions. We all know Friday practice sessions can be unrepresentative.', ""Mclaren won by 30-40 seconds in Miami, that advantage isn't just a front wing difference."", 'We’ll see after the race how things play out, too early to draw any conclusions. Although really you’d need multiple race weekends.\xa0', ""I mean Friday isn't exactly a solid representation.  We gotta keep in mind most qualifying Saturdays have generally been decided by a thenth or less.  A front wing could very well be the difference in that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI understand qualifying isn't race trim, but who knows.  I will admit a front wing isn't going to be the sole decider in shaking up the grid, but if teams were using older-spec wings for the first 8 races it should show *some* impact."", 'It was practice. Why do so many people make such declarations after practices? Let’s see how qualifying goes shall we?', ""Hopium isn't always foolproof."", 'Non flexible wings don\'t make cars slower over a couple of laps. \n\nThe cars will be as fast as usual for 1 or 5 laps. \n It will hurt their tyre usages on long stints as they have to choose between beeing fast in the straight or have more downforce in the corners. \n\nResulting in beeing slower on a straight to keep the cornering speed or using up more of your tyres in the corners to go fast on the straight. \n\nWe will find out if anything happened in the pecking order on Sunday during the race at the earliest. \n\nIn FP2 Norris drove 3 laps on the medium at average 1.18s while Verstappen was doing 1.20.0 avarage with the same tyre but more laps and Piastri was doing 1.20.8 avarage with more laps. \n\nPiastri and Verstappen (and others) are also capable of driving 1.18s a lap for 4 or 5 laps and then the tyres might be done and they would have to continue with 1.22 laps. And nobody knows how much fuel they had in the car and what the "" simulation"" setting for the long run where. \n\nIf we tell Piastri to drive 1.20.8 s for 10 laps because we expect during the race to do that for 31 laps and Verstappen was told to do 1.20.0 because they anticipate to use that tire for no more then 25 laps in the race. \n And then they come back in and look at the tyre degradation and see that drivers were going too fast to have the tyres last their anticipated length or they find out they could have gone even quicker. \n\n\nLong story short. It is practice, other then cars looking stable or unstable on track there is nothing serious that spectators can learn from it.']",153,47,0.88,153,446,446,10,1,0.0,10

And with a long term driver in Albon alongside Sainz as the veteran, instead of the revolving door of pay drivers, they’re getting better driver feedback.', ""You can either make your car good at straight lines \nOr good in turns \n\nYou can't make it both due to the laws of physics \n\nAs a result teams adjust their cars differently to try find a good balance \n\nHowever in F1 your only aloud so much testing and RnD time so often you don't know where you're car sits until you're already in the season as result certain cars end up on the straight line of things or on bendy side of the balance which means certain tracks that favourite straight line speed reward the speedy cars and cars that can conour well do better in bendy tracks \n\n(Slightly joke here)\nAnd then you have McLaren who decided to fuck aero and just worked out how to keep the tires cold so there car works everywhere because the tires dont fall apart lol"", 'Im not too sure but I have a feel it has to do with the Williams design philosophy across all regs and they always make a car based to their expertise which they know best even if it makes them vulnerable and certain tracks', 'In Williams’s case they werent exactly great anywhere in this time span, except some low drag tracks\n\nAlso in all their better years, the car progressed due to in season upgrades. 2021, 2023 and 2024 all had upgrades mid season, but later than catalunya\n\nThis statistic exists for Catalunya cause it’s the only “early” season track that’s consistently been on the calendar since then.(besides Monaco, but i think they were generally shit at Monaco too)\n\nAustralia had a big COVID gap and they scored with the hards gamble with Albon in 2023, not because the car had pace\n\nChina had a big COVID gap\n\nSuzuka had a COVID gap and it used to be in autumn anyway\n\nImola wasnt on the calendar precovid\n\nJeddah is only a thing since 2021, and the first gp was in autumn\n\nMiami is also a new track\n\nMonaco and Catalunya are the only tracks that have been consistent early season in this time frame\n\nFor example, i remember the 2021 Williams having upgrades around Austria, the 2023 one in Canada and the 2024 one i’m not sure but still later in the summer.

I didn't see much, now this question in the press conference. \n\nI'd be surprised if Ferrari let go of Fred so soon tbh, he's been doing a good job so far"", 'What happens if there are the same set of times in qualifying?

We don't even know what the teams are testing, we have nothing to even evaluate the results we're seeing against.\n\nAfter quali is the earliest possible time to start making up an opinion, that's the time for hot takes and over reactions.   \nBut even then it usually takes 2-3 races for a pattern to emerge."", 'Yall have any fun spins on Piastri\'s ""Pastry"" nickname?\n\nI like ""Tasty Pastry"" personally', ""What's the difference, in practical terms, between a slipstream (good, makes you faster) and dirty air (bad, makes you slower).

It seems to arbitrarily be described as one of these two things when one car follows another, but I don't know what makes it one vs the other."", 'Why are there no points at all for drivers in the 11-20th places, as there seems to be no difference between a driver who consistently finishes just outside of the points and those who finish last.

As for Horner.. well already last year there were rumours of people unhappy at RB, and Jos Verstappen (apparently) said Max will move to another team if Horner remains TP, later on Max said he has a great relationship with Horner so it all faded away but yes this is pretty much the source of the rumours i think', ""Ferrari's next year™ policies means the team isn't performing to the company's or media expectations.  \n  \nSo as is tradition, shortly after a new TP gets there, who is restructuring the team on how they see it optimal (or worst, restructuring the previous TP structure which finally showed effect under their tenure), is called to question and Horner would be, from their perspective, a good candidate to take over.  \n  \nAll while ignoring their heydays, where the team was encapsulated from the media & company meddling and left to work on their problems, to produce a dominant era with the Todt (kept media & company at bay), Bryne & Brawn for technical leadership & Schumacher as a driver to extract the most the car can deliver."", 'is fred doing a good job though ? \n\nas far as im concerned ferrari are still ferrari', 'I believe the person that sets the time first gets the position.\n\nIn the title decider at Jerez in 1997, three drivers set the exact same time for pole position.']",6,20,0.87,6,19,19,1,6,0.010000000000000009,1
