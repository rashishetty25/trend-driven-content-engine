Verstappen must outscore Norris by any amount of points to remain in contention. If Norris finishes ahead, or neither score points, then Verstappen cannot win the title.

For Piastri things are a little more complex. Norris must outscore him by 4 points or more to wrap up the title. Note that 3 points would leave Piastri 25 points behind, but if Piastri wins the final race then he wins the title on countback of total wins if Norris scores no points.

**All permutations which give Norris the title:**

- Norris wins the race
- Norris finishes anywhere P2-P7, Piastri must finish at least 2 places behind Norris, and Verstappen anywhere behind Norris.
- Norris finishes P8, Piastri must not score points (i.e. P11 or lower) and Verstappen must finish anywhere behind Norris.

P9 or P10 points for Norris would not be enough to get it done
