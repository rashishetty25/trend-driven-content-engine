If someone can tell me a year where 2-4 drivers were not always a lock for Q1 exits id be fascinated. Q1s are really top notch this year and yes a part of that is due to the convergence on car performance but also i believe not having any drivers apart from Stroll that feel like they shouldnt be there has made this sport look great.

the rookies show a lot of promise against their more experienced teammates and most of the gaps arent abusive so far

Even Borteleto in the Kick tractor isnt a lock for P20 to me. Now if only someone inspiring could replace Stroll although he as well has shown stuff this year to be fair

now if Q1 tomorrow and from now on is terrible, i am sorry","['if only we could get some decent tracks', ""I don't even think you can knock Stroll because he's the only Aston with points."", 'Championship standings:\n\n- Lance Stroll: 8 Points\n- Fernando Alonso: 0 Points\n\nYou keep his name out of your mouth', '>Q1s are really top notch this year\n\nThat\'s actually a pretty great point to describe the ""vibe"" of the season so far. \n\nMy pre-season guesses at rookies who may not make it past this year would have been Doohan and Hadjar. Not because of any skill issue concerns, but mainly just for the fact that the other rookies were Bearman, who\'d already shown he was capable in F1, Bortoleto, with his rookie F3 and F2 championships, and Antonelli, who would actually have to actively, maliciously take out Russell while leading the race multiple races in a row to be anywhere in the same room as the idea of being dropped.\n\nWe\'re 4.5 races in, with 5-6 rookies on the grid, and so far the only one looking ""bogged down"" is Liam.
