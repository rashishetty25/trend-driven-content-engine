1mnfrtn,What Formula 1's boss has told us about F1's future,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mnfrtn/what_formula_1s_boss_has_told_us_about_f1s_future/,2025-08-11, Video,,"['As Seb Vettel once said about this same idea: ""I think it\'s complete bullshit to be honest"" I think I\'m old school but reverse grids are absolutely not for me', 'The only way they can make a reverse grid work is if they take out sprint quali and instead have sprints be in reverse championship order with any crazy setup they want, no plank wear etc. Let them build cars for combat! Oh..', 'Reverse grid sprints probably wouldn‚Äôt be as interesting as we‚Äôd think. Might create a more interesting end result for the WCC though. \n\nI just have to wonder how aggressive slower cars would be to defend if they realistically have no legitimate chance to score points reliably any other way?', 'Only way i see reverse grids would be if it was random, one race its normal, one race its reverse... otherwise drivers would just sandbag.', ""Reverse grids are a teaching tool that some junior series believe in. My favorite iteration of them is the British system with points for positions gained. The thing reverse grids do is ensure in a low level series that you don't have a driver that is significantly more skilled (experience, talent, whatever reason. Experience is incredibly important in a low level series) than most of the field, always qualifies well, and never really has to practice overtaking. That can be an issue in some F4 series, though Italian F4 has developed talent well without them, aided by their generally strong strength of field.\n\nFrankly, I don't think reverse grids should be a thing by F2. All of those drivers should be experienced, and if the cars and teams are as equal as possible there should be enough parity that the same driver isn't on pole most weeks anyway. And, if someone's up there consistently, it should mean that they deserve to be up there. (I'd like it to be centrally run with actually equal circumstances rather than better teams having advantage, but that's a different issue).\n\nHaving them in F1 makes far less sense than even F2. Every point in F1 is important. Especially in tracks that are difficult to overtake at, reverse grids really don't award points on merit."", '‚ÄúWe need new fans, so we introduce more cognitive load and bullshit rules‚Äù \n\nI‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs enough fans already.
