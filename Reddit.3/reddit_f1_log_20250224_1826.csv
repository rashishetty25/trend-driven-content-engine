I must\'ve listened to about 5 bring back v10s ""your questions answered"" podcasts, and it\'s clear that they have a very high impression of him.\n\n[Here\'s the most recent example I just finished listening to - go to 24:30](https://youtu.be/D9qvO2Zuqmk?si=J2ve3zYcJLBpz8NI)\n\nMark Hughes: (paraphrasing) ""There\'s only two drivers who were head and shoulders above the others in the 1990s\xa0 and those were Hakkinen and Schumacher. The others were quite evenly matched. Irvine, Frentzen, Coulthard, Barrichello, Villeneuve, Fisichella were all evenly matched""\n\nI find this comment pretty bizarre because (among other things) it implies that Hakkinen was in the same league as Schumacher, but even weirder, a respected formula 1 journalist is saying something that is highly debatable and is just casually passing it off as an accepted fact. I get when people say Schumacher was the best of his generation and pass it off as a fact of conversation - he has the results to back that up, but there\'s zero basis to shoehorning Hakkinen there with him.\n\nWhy is Hakkinen rated so highly? Especially if you agree with Mark Hughes, I\'d like to understand why. I\'ve watched all of Hakkinen\'s races, analyzed all of his results, and I just don\'t understand it.', ""Michael Schumacher was racing the last time I watched F1. My favorite driver was Eddie Irvine. That's where my knowledge of F1 is at. \n\nI'm looking to at the very least follow the race results and pick up some general news (mostly from here) for this season. \n\nAre there any apps, (other) subs, or websites I should be using to help me keep track of things, or am I good just checking in here daily? \n\nMy intention is to absorb quite a bit this year and then make an informed decision on if I wanna watch F1 in a more serious manner again."", ""Now that we're into the launch season proper, am I the only one who finds the car unveilings to be underwhelming? I think that's my issue with the F1 75 Live event -- it kind of took the wind out of the sails for the 2025 cars. This time last year, I was eagerly checking my calendar and refreshing the page, waiting for the next car to be revealed. This year Aston Martin released photos of the AMR25 and I barely even noticed it. It wasn't even headline news on sites like *Autosport*."", 'https://preview.redd.it/6xer2x1z23le1.png?width=278&format=png&auto=webp&s=85cdc75ae59f43e5c4da45ce58e8e180ebaa1017\n\nThoughts....on trademark infringements?

Alex? We'll see about that."", ""When Sainz left they had Verstappen paired with Ricciardo, I think it's fair to say those where two top drivers, probably more so than Verstappen + Sainz would be.\n\nAfter that they promoted from within, with little success.\n\nAfter that, they signed a top mid-field driver, who was at the time comfortably the strongest driver not already locked in with a team. Nobody really forsaw the total collapse he had.\n\nI don't think you can say Red Bull actively avoided having a strong driver next to Verstappen, they've not really had better options. Except maybe Sainz this year, but then is there really much reason to assume he'd do better than Perez? They tried getting a respected experienced driver from the outside and it didn't work out at all, why try the same thing again instead of promoting from within like they used to do?"", 'His statement will look a little bit weird in hindsight if Lawson is closer to Verstappen than Albon was.', 'I mean,  Marko (I know that old wind bag is full of shit) said about driver #2.  \n\n“He should become a consistent points scorer and help Max when he needs to, not try to,” he told”\n\nThat’s why they didn’t sign Carlos.

1iwqacf,"Do we have a record lowest number of current drivers to have taken part in an earnest ""title battle""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1iwqacf/do_we_have_a_record_lowest_number_of_current/,2025-02-24, Discussion,"Obviously, modern F1 fans are well aware of the level of net dominance we've seen in the past 15 years, with only 1 WDC winner since 2010 winning it fewer than 4 times. However, those 15 years have had very different outcomes, of some years seeing a straight cruise to the record books, versus others with a number of different drivers in contention right through the final race. 

Currently, our grid is not only very rookie-heavy, but the dominance over the most recent regulations cycle has dwindled the number of drivers to ever have taken part in an earnest title battle. 

At any point in any season, only Fernando Alonso, Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, and Lando Norris have ever truly been in the running to win the WDC. Considering that 3 of them are champions themselves, that's a pretty surprising statistic. 

Considering that FOM themselves have hyped up long shots like Perez in 2023 or Bottas for a number of years, there are seasons in which a great deal of drivers have had more legitimate title shots than any of the other 15 drivers on this year's grid... but of course, with aspiring competitors in potentially top seats like Piastri, Lawson, Russell, and Antonelli, we may add to this list quickly! ","[""1994 post Senna's death and when Mansell wasn't present, there was zero drivers who had ever battled for a championship prior to 1994 let alone won one."", 'The first ever f1 season had no drivers to have previously been In a battle for an F1 Championship.', 'We just need to not have one car way faster than the rest to start the season.

Only Alonso and Raikkonen had really been in proper title fights before that season. So that's (x2).\n\n\nThis year Leclerc has never really been in the running for a title yet and Norris was barely in the running at all last season because the field got way more competitive in the second half so a bunch of teams and drivers, including his own teammate, took wins and points away from him when a dominant car like Verstappen had early season would have given him a much better chance of catching up Verstappen's gigantic lead. I'd honestly say only Alonso, Hamilton and Verstappen have been in proper title fights on the current grid. Including Norris is incorrect IMO. So (x3).\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Just had a look back from 1994-2006. Looks about right give or take depending on what you call a credible title contender. I don't really class Villeneuve as a credible challenge to Hill in their dominant 1996 Williams for example. Some might think it's harsh but to me he was no challenge to Hill in the championship the whole season.\xa0\n\n\n1994 Senna, Mansell (x2).\n\n\n1995 Mansell, Schumacher (x2).\n\n\n1996-1997 Schumacher, Hill (x2).\n\n\n1998 Schumacher, Hill, Villeneuve (x3).\n\n\n1999 Schumacher, Hill, Villeneuve, Hakkinen (x4).\n\n\n2000-2001 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Hakkinen, Irvine (x4).\n\n\n2002 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Irvine (x3).\n\n\n2003 Schumacher, Villeneuve (x2).\n\n\n2004-2005 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Raikkonen (x3).\n\n\n2006 Schumacher, Villeneuve, Raikkonen, Alonso (x4)\n\n\nSo quite a few seasons during this time have had 2 previous title contenders on the grid."", ""will this year be pog to watch as someone who's never watched before?"", ""If the field was closer it would not have been that different, maybe Sainz/Russel , other than that who's good enough to be in the mix?"", ""Alboreto was on the grid during that time wasn't he?
