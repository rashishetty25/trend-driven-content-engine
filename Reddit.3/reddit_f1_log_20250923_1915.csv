He'll need to reset his mindset and self acknowledge that the mistakes he made were because of the pressure he put on himself.\n\nIt's a bit of a clich√©, but I do believe you learn more from your mistakes than your success.\n\nMcLaren talk highly of his analytical skills and his work ethic when it comes to focusing on his weak spots.\n\nRegardless, the next race is going to tell us so much about Piastri and whether he can perform under significant pressure, because the next race will have the biggest spotlight on him in his short career so far, even surpassing his debut imo."", ""It just looked he was distracted all the time. First the jump start which was not even milliseconds close but as close as a second. Then the crash it seemed as if he was again distracted & carried too much speed into the turn thinking he'll make some overtakes in the process.

1no0vla,I think the 10 second penalty for Albon shows a deeper problem of the current stewarding,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1no0vla/i_think_the_10_second_penalty_for_albon_shows_a/,2025-09-22, Discussion,"I think this incident highlights the problems of the recent limit on penalties. Only handing out 5 or 10-second penalties for the vast majority of incidents means that incidents like this, which cost Colapinto 25+ seconds, kind of make it worth it (obviously not really, as it also costs Albon and penalty points). Introducing 15-second penalties, and actually using drive-throughs and stop-and-go's. 

The current stewarding process needs fixing in general. I think a selection of professional stewards is needed, but even stuff like this shows they need to go back over a lot of the guidance and really have another look.

They have pretty much sorted the extending track limits, which was a massive talking point a few years ago, by just using the B&W black, which is what it was there for, but wasn't used for ages. It shows that a lot of these stewarding problems do come from the guidance issued to them.","[""Penalties are not meant to repair the damage done, just to disuade drivers from doing certain things. I don't think it was worth it for Albon, even if it was way worse for Colapinto."", 'Bad take. Penalties aren‚Äôt there to vindicate the driver that got crashed into, but to punish the driver that caused the crash. Sucks to be the guy that got crashed into, but giving Albon a 25 second penalty because he cost Colabinto 25 seconds doesn‚Äôt do shit.', ""I kind of agree. Penalty should punish, if it doesn't really have a meanigful effect on your result then it is pointless.\n\nIt is the same thing as monetary fines for road traffic violations, it doesn't punish weathy people the same as poor people. That is why some countries have income based fines."", ""Stewarding has many more serious problems, I don't think this is a major problem.   \nConsistency and timeliness mostly.\n  \n\nIf you are found to gamble on penalties being worth it penalties do increase and have in the past (ie don't be dumb on radio). Penalties are also already handed out based on result often, so smaller penalties suffice.   \n  \nThe current drivers are also keeping it rather clean, so there is no need to penalize missteps as harshly"", ""Yeah, I totally understand that penalties are not meant to repair the damage done, but looking back it was a very good trade for Albon, I don't think he was penalized at all tbh."", 'Penalties should penalise the action and not the outcome. Which has been heavily discussed before with the Ham/Ver incident in Silverstone. \n\nPeople said a race ban would be appropriate, because Verstappen crashed with 50G and Hamilton was able to continue and score points.', 'I agree with you - Fornaroli on Dunne in the F2 race is another example.\n\nOn Russell at Monaco - it‚Äôs not good race direction IMO if the guidance allows drivers to profit from purposefully taking a penalty, which is entirely why the standard one moved up to ten seconds from five in the first place.', ""What is this take\n\nThis is how it works literally everywhere in any Motorsport  \nIf you think this is a problem, it's a problem with the entirety of Motorsport\n\nThe REAL problems F1 stewarding has are an entirely different conversation, this is not one of them"", '>\xa0Only handing out 5 or 10-second penalties for the vast majority of incidents means that incidents like this, which cost Colapinto 25+ seconds,\xa0\n\n\nThe alternative is to give out penalties based on the outcome which is so much worse.', ""been saying it for a while. Driving standards have tanked a few years after the 5/10 second penalties. They were introduced to have less severe options for minor shit but they very very quickly became a replacement for almost all penalties. So many insane things done on track and rarely a drive through, stop go or black flag. Max shoulda got the black flag in mexico for sure. IN brazil again max should have gotten a drive through probably for how egregious that shove off was, but instead no penalty at all but that's because over hte years worse and worse behaviour went from a drive through, to a 10 second penalty, to a 5 second penalty to often being ignored.\n\nF2 is a heavy result of this. Kids coming through having never really watched/remembered f1 before the 5 second penalties were introduced. dive bombing being rewarded, cutting corners being rewarded is just the f1 they would have gone from like 5-15 yrs old watching and now those kids are in f3/f2 driving like maniacs.""]",0,28,0.34,0,249,249,0,1,0.010000000000000009,0
