In GTD Pro, the class where GT3 road based cars are piloted by top rated professional Platinum and Gold drivers, we see 15 entries (cars) featuring 9 different road based chassis from nine different familiar manufacturers - sure to be an exciting and competitive class. [Breakdown of GTD Pro](https://www.dailysportscar.com/2025/01/22/2025-daytona-24-hours-preview-gtd-pro.html).\n\nThat\'s 27 cars with all professional driver squads - the primary focus of the broadcast. A field bigger than F1. It\'s the biggest professional GT3 field seen around the globe. And the only other championship, aside from WEC, where the GTP/Hypercar prototypes compete.\n\n24 hour races are mentally punishing. Strategy plays a huge part in racing here - stay on the lead lap and in the lead group, and after a late race safety car with 2h-1h to go, it\'s anybodies guess as to who crosses the line first to win the Rolex. Recovering from mistakes is possible, but don\'t push it too far or you\'ll be in the pits for a lengthy repair, or even out of the race altogether.\n\nIf you\'re in one of the [red highlighted countries here](https://i.imgur.com/seDLNZV.jpeg), you will need a VPN to watch on YouTube.

Similar to how Suzuka 2011 is probably the better 'drive' than Canada 2011 for Button, even if it was less wild.\n\nI only started in 1999 so I didn't see them all. My friend has watched since 1990 and says Schumacher was never exactly as good as 1994/5/6/just about 7.\n\nIt's funny to me that Schumacher was always quite lowkey on his famous wins. Spain 1994 that he won stuck in gear: he said it took a couple of laps but it was a) the perfect gear to be stuck in and b) once he figured it out it was fine and c) it had amazing torque anyway. Like Ricciardo Monaco 2017/8/whenever he got stuck in gear: once you've figured it out, it's fine. \n\nSpain 1996, he just didn't know what other's problem was. I can't think of any *he* was emphatic about."", 'Who do you think had the second best car in 2013: Lotus, Ferrari or Mercedes? Who was third best?', 'Turkey 2020–brand new track surface, rain, and Stroll P1.  LFG.', 'Any tips on where to get f1 merch besides the team stores? \n\nLooking for a Ferrari x Lewis jacket', ""Can't make a post it keeps getting auto deleted"", 'If F1 had a Rookie of the Year award like in Super Formula, who would win in each year and why?', 'Spa 1995 is absolutely a candidate for Schumacher’s best drive. You can dispute the tactics he used to keep Damon behind, but the fact is he had absolutely no right to stay ahead for a whole lap in those conditions. When the rain stopped a few laps later, it basically guaranteed he would win before the SC intervened. You could maybe argue that we don’t know what Alesi and Coulthard would’ve gone onto achieve that day without their mechanical failures. For all we know, Schumi may only have finished third and that might change the way we view that drive.\n\nSpain 94 is a viable contender too. What he did that day is totally unprecedented as far as I’m aware of, there’s just no basis for comparison. Any  other time I’ve heard of a driver being stuck in gear it has not worked out well at all, but there’s so many variables involved in having a problem like that and for all we know, Schumi could be correct in his humble assessment of that day. Just FYI, Ricciardo was not stuck in gear at Monaco at all, from what I understand he had an MGU-H failure and Monaco is by a million miles the best circuit at which to have that problem, because a loss of power really makes little difference. At the overwhelming majority of other circuits he wouldn’t have had a prayer of holding onto the lead.\n\nI would throw Aida 95 into the mix. It shocks me that people never talk about that drive, as it was very similar to Hungary 98 in the sense he had to come from behind on what would generally be considered the inferior strategy. On the day, Schumi and Hill were stuck behind Berger for the first stint, allowing Coulthard to disappear. Schumi was three-stopping, DC two-stopping, yet Schumi turned an approx 15 second deficit into a ~20 second victory in what was arguably an inferior car. Maybe DC was seen to have thrown away that race more than Schumi won it (Brundle - in one of his first commentaries - implied as much) but it absolutely stands out as one of the great ‘How did he pull that off?!?’ moments of his career.\n\nIn general, it’s so hard to say what Schumacher’s #1 drive is because in most of the drives considered to be his best, the circumstances were so vastly different. Comparing Spain 94, Spa 95, Spain 96 and Hungary 98 like comparing apples, oranges, bananas and grapes. What I will say is that Schumacher’s ability to wow everyone in such vastly difficult yet hugely challenging circumstances highlights just how amazingly complete a driver he was - to me, it’s the sole reason he’s the GOAT.', ""Not quite the same but I remember F1 Racing when he celebrated his 20th anniversary asking him what were his favourite drives of his career. He said Suzuka 2000 was number 1 because after all the years of hard work and struggle, he reached the goal of winning a title for Ferrari and ending the drought. However his favourite after that was actually Brazil 1994 - he came out first race and surprised everyone with his pace, raced Senna hard and was beating him before he forced him into a spin and ended up winning by a lap - basically said it's the drive he felt most proud of"", 'It’s difficult to say what Schumacher’s best drive was, there’s so many to choose from. You’ve got all the famous wet weather wins (Spa 1992, Spa 1995, Nurburgring 1995, Spain 1996, Monaco 1997, Spa 1997, Britain 1998, Nurburgring 2000, 2003 USA, 2006 China). There are races he didn’t win like Spain 1994, Spa 1998, Malaysia 1999. Hungary 1998, France 2004 are the famous ‘qualifying lap’ races. I think Schumacher himself said Japan 2000 was his favourite though.', 'Lotus > Ferrari > Mercedes for me\n\nThere’s an argument for the Merc being second fastest on pure pace alone but there were many instances where they struggled for race pace, usually because of tyre management.\n\nLotus were second quickest. For much of the season Kimi was pretty closely matched with Alonso, and while I do think that version of Kimi would’ve fared much better in equal cars than he did relative to Alonso the following year, I don’t think he was ever good enough to make up the entirety of that 2014 deficit. \n\nAfter Lotus changed to long wheelbase - which Kimi largely struggled with - they were by far the quicker car. Grosjean beat Alonso at five successive races. There’s no way that would’ve happened in anything other than a clearly superior car.']",5,21,0.69,5,18,18,0,5,-0.040000000000000036,0
