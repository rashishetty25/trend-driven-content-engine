1hkvmr3,[Mercedes AMG F1] 23/12/2009: The day Michael Schumacher announced his return to F1 with Mercedes,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hkvmr3/mercedes_amg_f1_23122009_the_day_michael/,2024-12-23, Social Media,,"['Damn, right after the Russell skiing post', '""Oh yeah 7 more titles incoming"" - some random fan in 2009', ""I wasn't watching back then, but it must have been such a crazy announcement to hear. Were there rumors for a while before it was announced?"", 'Michael’s comeback success was different that what everyone expected. But this announcement was insane at the time. For people who had followed him in his first career knew he left too early, still capable of amazing drives. \n\nThe motorcycle accident definitely changed what he could do on a race track, there were some serious injuries, and one to the skull which generally results in a fatality. \n\nYet  the 40 year old improved every year till he retired again. In his final year he was faster than Rosberg in race pace and they were 10-10 in Quali. Rosberg in his prime against a 43 year old, who also got pole in Monaco.\n\nMichael in my opinion is in the top 3 of Grand Prix racing. Wish he could be in the paddock and part of the current formula 1 culture. #KeepFightingMichael', ""I had pretty much stopped watching F1 regularly once he retired in 2006. By 2009, my cable tv package no longer had the sports channel that broadcast F1. I remember being so excited hearing Schumi's come back, i switched to a more expensive cable package. His first test was in a GP2 car, he came within 4/10ths of the lap record sitting in a race car for the first time in over 3 yrs and in a machinery completely different to what he was used to. You could see he still had the pace between 2010 to 2012, but reliability issues, mid-grid positions prone to crashes and few unforced errors pretty much brought an end to his comeback. Ross Brawn would later credit Schumacher's feedback and work with the engineers are being the foundation for Mercedes championship success in 2014.\n\nWe now know both Williams and Mclaren tried signing Schumacher multiple times in the 90s and 2000s. It is anyones guess how many more titles he could have won had he jumped from one competitive team to another instead of toiling much of the 90s without titles at Ferrari. One of the greatest, if not the greatest driver ever to compete in the sport."", ""What people don't know is that Schumacher  had a life threatening motorcycle crash in early 2009.\n\nHis PR-team tried to down play it, but if you saw the leaked pictures with comments by his doctor at the time.\nThat crash was more than serious.\n\nThe fact he survived that one should have been a sign for him to stop. Mark Hughes some years ago  wrote in an article that a crash like this is 90%  fatal. \nMichael was insanely lucky. \n\nHe already had  permanent brain damage thanks to a shattered attery, he also had a broken neck and a fracture at the base of his skull."", 'Imagine if he stayed with Ferrari one more year, could’ve made 2007 very epic.', 'Myself as a youthful 18 year old was so excited to be able to play as Schumacher in the new F1 game that year. God I miss him, I know he isn’t dead, but sometimes I still think about what he could be doing on the paddock in 2024. Of course, as a fan my plight pales in comparison to that of his family and close friends. Reading that interview with Mick where he all but openly admits that he yearns to have his dad back at this stage of his racing career and life is heartbreaking.', 'This was such an exciting announcement. I never expected Michael to win straight away considering the gap in racing but just wanted him to win 1 race.

The fact that Mekies still has a job there is the ultimate insult because he consistently fucks the drivers in the race every single time.\n\nIf they hadn't fucked them over every single time they went out things would have looked a lot different for Daniel."", ""At this point I'm convinced any mention of Daniel in a news article is an attempt by the publisher for clicks. It's time for the F1 media to let it go (and I'm a fan of his!)."", ""Despite everything having played out as it has, deep down, my gut tells me that had daniel gotten the RB main seat, he would've done really well. And no, this is not me and my wishful thinking, I genuinely believe so.\n\nWhen that vcarb was semi-decent early in the season, daniel hit some peaks in his performance, putting it among the top 5, where it just does not belong, definitely not in Q3 quali in the top 5 with 4 top teams hogging the top 8 spots. Given a good car, one that speaks to his strengths, his peaks could genuinely be hit more often. His problem, and VCARBs problem was that the car was generally a shitbox, and often the team self-sabotaged with strategy.\n\nI think the RB main team's car is exactly that - A more refined formula 1 car that suits his strengths well, ones that he shares with Max, on the extremes of balance. There is a reason RB have struggled to find someone capable of filling that seat since daniel left, because genuinely no one else can likely keep up with the car's design direction the way max does. But daniel already had done so, before he left. He was the last direct rival to max in that seat, driving the same car, with the same development directions.\n\nNot to mention, Vcarb TP mekies and ceo bayer repeatedly praised daniel on his technical inputs that helped in developing their car, something they don't really do/did in Yuki's case. That should not come as a surprise given what daniel achieved at Renault with that shitbox of a car and team. RB could've benefitted more from having Daneil in the 2nd seat giving his inputs that were on the same track as max, rather than put up with checo's nonsense for so long, that caused them to waste so much development time and even rollback the chassis on his car just to please him and clear the air on 'its the car' discourse. So much valuable time and development lost that could've been avoided if Daniel was in that seat, working in tandem with Max.\n\nAnyways, that's just my 2 cents. Sorry for the pseudo-rant.\n\nTL;DR:  Daniel's peaks in a shitty vcarb that he helped develop & improve with his feedback would've translated very well to the main RB team where he would work with Max on the same development direction (their driving styles are similar), instead of wasting valuable time and money on checo and the opposite development direction for the 2nd car.  They never replaced Daniel, the only driver apart from Max that did excellently in that main team with the same development direction that Max prefers."", 'For me, it will always be a “what if” with Ricciardo and his last injury. He came out blazing in the VCARB and built some overnight hype around himself. I can’t help but wonder if he had another amazing result or two and they gave him a shot at RBR again. \n\nThat being said, post-injury, his form didn’t seem to impress and I don’t disagree with the decisions made for him to lose his seat.']",1557,178,0.93,1557,5039,5039,41,3,0.0,41
1hkqm89,Women liking F1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hkqm89/women_liking_f1/,2024-12-23, Discussion,"so I'm a teen (f) and I've been watching F1 since I can remember. I literally grew up watching every race, my father being a hard-core fan. Hell I saw some of these ""big"" races, like I remember watching anxiously as Romain Grosjean spun off, the car catching fire and I even remember then the feed being cut off cause they did not want to show anymore incase he didn't make it out alive. 

Anyway, I've been a core ferrari fan all my life. It's not because of any one thing in particular and I don't support all of the teams decisions, but because it was a team my father once supported. I fell in love with RED and the emotions attached with the teams previous driver like Räikkönen and Vettel. 

But now, it's become so insanely mainstream. Drive to survive has made it into this insanely big thing where there are so many people who now all of a sudden care about motorsport only cause the drivers look good. There's no issue with being a new fan, however my issue is that so many people talking only about the drivers looks invalidates the skill and people who care about the racing aspect, especially as a woman.
The moment you talk about F1 with men who don't know you, the first assumption is that we only watch the sport cause of the men. I had to mention the ferrari thing earlier now because it happens a lot more when you saw you're a ferrari fan.

Now, obviously certain men are the issue but it's genuinely becoming increasingly common to have a view point as such and I wanted to know of other women who watch F1 have experienced a similar outlook.

Disclaimer, I'm not talking about all men or only men but it's simply an observation.","[""For every gate there's a crappy keeper that wants to deem people not worthy. Never feel the need to prove your f1ness to some asshat.

You don't have to be able to name the top 3 of every single Monaco race since the dawn of time to be a fan. You don't have to justify yourself to some insecure bozo. \n\nMy personal opinion is that people are free to enjoy a sport however they please. If they go for a driver for looks, that's their choice. It doesn't hinder my enjoyment of the sport in any way, so why should it bother me? I'm sure drivers don't mind: more money for them from merch and buzz.\n\n I'll save my annoyance for developments such as INSANE ticket pricing, or what races they put in (\\*cough\\* Qatar \\*cough\\*) or take out (German GP!), or Helmut Marko LOL"", 'There is a type of man who is always going to be dismissive toward a woman liking anything that is perceived as being male-oriented.

However they still kept it together enough for a 4th title for Max which is all you can ask for strategy and pit wise when your lead evaporated and you are 2nd-3rd fastest car most races.\n\nFerrari is who I chose because honestly they didn’t have expectations, they didn’t really fumble anything. They slow burned the entire season with it ending in a borderline constructors challenge on McLaren and Charles having a chance to snipe 2nd. They didn’t really MAKE a blunder like RB or McLaren did.\n\nMerc honestly went to the same bucket as RB and McLaren because the gap between them + Ferrari was night and day to the rest of the grid and they did mostly okay with a car that wound up being Red Bull pre max titles during Merc dominance where it just won on the very small window of tracks it excelled at. Far fall from grace of the Merc era, but such a huge step up in development during the season compared to y1/y2 of the ground effect cars', 'I think even Ferrari messed up an upgrade early in the season. I remember several races where Charles and Carlos were fighting at the back of the midfield.', ""Ferrari did fumble their Spain upgrade pretty hard which set them back to 4th fastest till Netherlands, but even they bounced back from that setback.\n\nI agree with you on Ferrari. Expectations were not high (as per usual), but they delivered pretty well on all accounts. The car is finally not a tyre guzzler and has really good race pace. Strategy actually improved to the point they weren't as memeable (though the good ol Ferrari still pops up sometimes). Their drivers were on top of their form, consistently delivering and maximising their opportunities all the way till the end I honestly considered it a miracle how they kept the WCC fight till the end. And this is with McLaren having the superior car for most of 2024.""]",63,9,0.81,63,8,8,3,1,0.0,3

Please [direct these to the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/formula1) instead.","[""I'd like to get people's thoughts on Kimi Raikkonen. There's no doubt he was a fantastic driver, but how fantastic, exactly? \n\nI recently watched Beat Zehnder's beyond the grid, where he rated Raikkonen as the fastest driver he worked with. Additionally, Marc Priestley said that Raikkonen was the fastest driver he ever worked with, even quicker than Alonso and Hamilton. Furthermore, Vettel mentioned in his beyond the grid that Raikkonen was the most naturally gifted team mate he ever worked with.\n\nHe's an interesting case for me, and the reason why he's an interesting case is because you can hear all these things about how good a driver Raikkonen was, with some extremely high (and over the top) praise of his skill level. But the problem is........that praise isn't really translated to his results on the track.\xa0 As good as he was, he doesn't really live up to the hype.\n\nI really struggle to believe that Raikkonen was this amazing top driver on Michelin tyres exclusively, and never recovered once Michelin quit F1. That doesn't logically follow for me, and seems like a convenient way to paint Raikkonen as better than he really was (of which, don't get me wrong, he was amazing, but what people say about him seems over the top). \n\nYet I can't deny that what insiders say about him tend to see it differently , that Raikkonen was actually **that** good.\n\nTl,Dr - simple question \nDo you think that Raikkonen was a driver, who early in his career,\xa0 was on par with Alonso & Schumacher?"", 'Isack Hadjar gave an interview to Canal+ a few days ago and when he was asked about things he must improve on, he replied ""basically everything outside of speed, as the speed is innate"".\n\nIs it impossible to ""teach"" speed ? Do F1 drivers already reach their maximum speed in their 1st season ?', 'Why do commentators keep pronouncing his name as ""Shaw LeClaire""?', 'Anybody have any info on a possible track in Rwanda/Africa?', ""Just having a think about the 2025 rookie FP sessions since the requirement is now four sessions over the season, two per car. My predictions:\n\n* McLaren - Alex Dunne will be in F2, but given that they didn't bother to hand Bortoleto an FP session this year, I imagine they'll stick with running Pato O'Ward and Ryo Hirakawa. Dunne might get one.\n\n* Ferrari - I'm hoping they run Dino Beganovic rather than Arthur Leclerc, since Beganovic might actually have a chance of getting to F1.\n\n* Red Bull/Racing Bulls - Hadjar will count for two sessions at Racing Bulls but that still leaves six to fill over both teams. They're clearly grooming Arvid Lindblad for a seat, possibly as soon as next year, so I expect him to get some sessions. Maybe they give Ayumu Iwasa one in Japan as well. I think it's unlikely that the other juniors (Marti, Goethe, Tramnitz) get any. They also still have Jake Dennis as a development driver and he did an FP session for RBR last year.\n\n* Mercedes - Antonelli's first two races will count. For the two sessions in Russell's car, they will probably go back to calling on Frederik Vesti since their other juniors are all 11 years old.\n\n* Aston Martin - Likely to be Felipe Drugovich and Jak Crawford sharing the sessions.\n\n* Alpine - Doohan counts for two, and they've just signed Paul Aron as a reserve so I assume he will get the others, although I hope they save one for Victor Martins.\n\n* Haas - Tough to call, since Bearman doesn't count anymore. They might run Beganovic if Ferrari don't, or they could run Hirakawa if McLaren don't; he tested with Haas in Abu Dhabi because of the new Toyota partnership. If neither are available, I guess they could dust off Pietro Fittipaldi who is still officially their reserve.\n\n* Williams - Likely to be Luke Browning for all four since Colapinto doesn't count anymore.\n\n* Sauber - Bortoleto will count for two, but as for the other two... I have absolutely no idea. They have basically nobody left in the academy after Pourchaire and Maloney left. Maybe they just give them to whichever unaffiliated F2 driver pays the most."", 'Who is the biggest midwit in F1 media? Granted I don\'t follow any other podcasts besided the races anymore. As the rest are trying too hard to be ""just a couple of lads having a chat"" even when they are great names like Autosport.\n\nThose who are not eligible are media people or ex racing people who happen to report on F1 like the ladies on the sky and F1tv broadcast. I\'m talking journalists.\n\nI don\'t want to mention his name as he might come across this but for me, it\'s Edd Straws closest confidant (not Glenn Freeman)\n\nHe just drones on and on when explaining simple concepts making them harder to understand. Until Straw comes in and says what needs to be said in a sentence or two.\n\nOr talks like some great authority and then back tracks and puts caveats when he realises that he\'s in deep waters. It really drags out the podcasts. I\'m always looking more forward to listening to the episodes when it\'s Edd, Mark and Glenn.', 'At his best years (2003-2007), Raikkonen was very good (dominating Coulthard and Montoya in 2004-2005 was especially good), but even in these seasons I don’t think he was at the level of Alonso and Schumacher, more the level of Button. He obviously had a stellar year in 2005, the best of his career, but in a weird sort of way, I think the 2005 McLaren’s unreliability helped the perception of him. If he won he was brilliant, and if it broke down he was so unlucky (but not lucky to be driving such a fast car!). \n\nHis career outside of the 2003-2007 period is pretty underwhelming. The only full time teammates he beat outside of that era were Grosjean in his first two years (who was starting to get on terms with him towards the end of 2013) and Giovinazzi. He was beaten by Massa in 2008-09 (during his prime) and was easily beaten by Alonso and Vettel across 2014-2018. I find it impossible to reconcile the general perception of him with his results on track, when you have to ignore 80% of a drivers career in order to rate them so high, there’s a problem. There are three possible explanations for his performances without Michelins. Either he declined abnormally early, he was horribly unadaptable, or was just never that good in the first place, none of which are particularly flattering for him. It’s probably a combination of all three. I remember Alan Permane said on Beyond the Grid he would sort of do the bare minimum, so maybe early in his career he could get by on pure talent, but later in his career being lazy caught up with him.\n\nIn conclusion, I think while Raikkonen was great at his best, even in these years he wasn’t as good as Schumacher or Alonso, and he certainly wasn’t as good as them across his whole career. He probably declined a bit after his title, (lack of motivation?) was very particular about car setup (which made him look really lost when the car didn’t suit him like in 2008, 2014, 2015, 2017), and was probably a bit overrated to begin with. Still the most recent Ferrari champion though.', ""Kimi knew instinctively the fastest way a car could go, unstable rear for extra rotation, just like Schumi and Verstappen also prefers. And if the car couldn't be set up like that, he didn't care.\n\nThere's also some other stuff about tires but that is too deep to get in to. He was the naturally fastest driver I ever saw in the sport."", 'I think a lot of Raikkonen\'s reputation and following came from his oftentimes blunt assessments like the ""leave me alone; I know what I\'m doing"" comment in Abu Dhabi. He never really cared for media commitments, but there were also times when his heart clearly wasn\'t in it anymore. I think he really only returned to Ferrari because Ferrari were very reluctant to promote Bianchi; not because Bianchi didn\'t deserve it, but because Ferrari were too conservative with their young driver program. When Raikkonen returned in 2012, he was very obviously doing it for the money, and when he moved to Alfa Romeo in 2019, it was clear that his best days were behind him. It was only a question of how long he was willing to trundle around in the minor points positions before he retired.\n\nSo in the end, he was a quick driver whose career is very much divided into two halves. In the first half he was highly rated and probably deserved more championships than he actually won, probably because of some mis-timed career moves. But in the second half he was struggling for motivation and his reputation was more down to his blunt interactions than his outright speed. He wasn\'t the same Raikkonen who had impressed in the first half of his career. He\'s in a bit of a funny spot for me -- both highly-rated and over-rated at the same time.', ""> But the problem is........that praise isn't really translated to his results on the track.\xa0 As good as he was, he doesn't really live up to the hype.  \n  \nI think it's something that we've seen with many drivers - if all goes well and they get a chance for the perfect lap many drivers can be unbelievably fast.  \n  \nBut what's the difference between various drivers considered as goats, is that they can do it on demand and when necessary as long as they can.  \nI think for Schumacher the 98 Hungarian GP is the usual example:  \n  \n> “Michael, you have 19 laps to pull out 25 seconds. We need 19 qualifying laps from you.”  \n  \nAnd him being able to comply with the team's request. The same can be said about Max or Lewis, where they had to be commanded to drive to a delta, instead of going at their natural pace""]",6,28,0.75,6,24,24,1,4,0.06000000000000005,1
