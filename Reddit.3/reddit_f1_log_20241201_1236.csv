But the Qatar track has no character whatsoever, I've never been able to discern the layout as it all looks exactly the same. It is a sea of flat tarmac, floodlights, and high-speed corners going into medium-speed corners. No identifiable corners, no landmarks for reference. 

Miami, a fairly universally disliked track, has distinct parts and buildings like the stadium and intersection for reference, so you can tell where in the track the rivers are. Bahrain, a similarly situated track with a barrage of floodlights in the middle of a desert, has the large tower by the first corner and goes up & down a hill for some kind of reference point. China has the gigantic pit building great first corner complex and a thrilling final few corners. Abu Dhabi, known for it's lack of character, is fairly nicely split into thirds with the high speed first sector, double-straight, and 90¬∞ corners galore.

Is this just me? Are there any other tracks that have a distinct lack of character that I am missing?
