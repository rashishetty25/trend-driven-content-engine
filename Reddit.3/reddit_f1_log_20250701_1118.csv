It immediately reminded me of his engineer ordering him to pit on lap 49 or 50, despite Hamilton's protests:

At that point in the race, he had switched to hard tires on lap 27 (so they were 23 laps old) and was ahead of Leclerc, who had pitted shortly before. After his own stop, Lewis came out 7 or 8 seconds behind Charles.

My technical knowledge is limited, but I understand that hard tires don’t last as long, and in Austria, the track temperature was over 50°C. That said, if Hamilton hadn’t lost the roughly 23 seconds in the pits for the tire change, could he have finished ahead of Leclerc?

In the future, apparently, only under one condition: The team must reposition itself strategically. This is said to include the demand that team boss Christian Horner either be replaced or have his powers curtailed.\n\nMarko might yet win after all.\n\nMark Hughes wrote this a year+ ago that fundamentally the question posed to RBR\'s owners was: take short-term pain and lose Verstappen but keep Horner, or lose Horner, the fundamental architect of RBR as we know it. Verstappen could be gone from F1 in 5 years, or another generational talent comes along, whereas Horner could still be in F1 in 10 years, and without him RBR are truly...who? What? \n\nI think Wolff\'s slightly backed into a corner that okay Russell is doing absolutely sufficiently to be kept, but even the possibility of *not having Verstappen as a rival* is critical.\n\nI genuinely believe various rumours have been true in the past but changed with time, e.g. Jon Noble said a while ago the AM/Verstappen rumours *were* true, but they\'re just so down in the dumps that all of that cooled off. Similarly a month or two ago the story seemed to be that Verstappen was going to see how things looked mid 2026 and decide then - fine, sensible - but the Merc being ahead stories are *so* prevalent that he might as well get on with it. The engines are in the 3rd trimester at this point. \n\nVerstappen to Merc 2026 would be only halfway down the wild driver transfer stories, over the years.\n\nI liked the point someone made ages ago, like: if you subtract the Dutch/Verstappen, who here is a *Red Bull* fan per se?\n\n> Horner believes that Mercedes has long since reached an agreement with its drivers, but is holding back on an official announcement to lull Red Bull into uncertainty.

Even George Russell recently said that the Dutchman would be at the top of every team's list if he were available and there were still cockpits available. However, Verstappen is not actually available. He is still under contract with Red Bull for three years.\n\n***However, there is still a small window of opportunity to leave the team. To do so, Verstappen must be ranked lower than third in the drivers' standings by the end of July.*** That is not the case at the moment. But Russell is only nine championship points behind and the McLaren drivers are out of reach. This is stirring the imagination in the paddock. For weeks, there has been speculation about whether Verstappen might still end up at Mercedes.\n\nMax Verstappen is tired of hearing the Mercedes question. ‘I don't think we need to talk about that anymore. Shall I repeat what I said last year? It's the same answer. I'm concentrating on driving. Then at some point, the time will come to think about next year.’\n\nHe is just as unwilling to make a clear commitment to Red Bull as he is to confirm whether he is in talks with Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff. Toto Wolff also has no desire to add fuel to the fire. ‘Everything is going according to plan. Contract negotiations are not held as public town hall meetings.’\n\n***According to Toto Wolff, negotiations with George Russell are still on schedule.***\n\n**Who would have to make way at Mercedes?**\n\nThe Austrian does not want to comment specifically on talks with Verstappen. Of course they are taking place. Wolff would be a poor team boss if he did not explore all options. But he also knows that he currently lacks the arguments to show George Russell the door.\n\nThe Englishman is driving in the form of his life. Verstappen and Russell in one team would be the best possible driver pairing and a strong counterweight to McLaren and Ferrari.

1lo4vqd,Esteban Ocon – The Hidden Midfield Maestro of 2025?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lo4vqd/esteban_ocon_the_hidden_midfield_maestro_of_2025/,2025-06-30, Statistics,"If you’ve been casually checking the race results this season, you might think Esteban Ocon’s performances have been a bit erratic. Haas hasn’t been grabbing headlines, and Ocon’s final race positions often put him mid-pack at best.

But if you dig into the numbers – like his +7 gain at the Austrian GP yesterday – a very different story begins to unfold.

Ocon’s race day consistency has actually been one of the most impressive in the midfield this year – it’s just masked by Haas’s weaker qualifying pace. Across all races so far in 2025, Ocon has gained an average of +3 positions per race, with a median gain of +5. That means more often than not, he’s making solid progress through the field regardless of where he starts.

He’s only lost positions in two races this season (Miami and Emilia Romagna), and in all others, he’s finished higher than he qualified. That kind of consistency shows real race craft – smart decisions, clean overtakes, and the ability to manage tyre and pace well during the race. It also suggests Haas might be making the most of race-day strategies, capitalising on clean air, undercuts or well-timed stops to help their drivers gain ground.

It suggests that qualifying is where Haas – and Ocon – are struggling most. But come Sunday, he’s one of the sharpest tools on the grid in terms of navigating through traffic and maximising opportunities.

He's not in the spotlight much, but maybe he should be. There’s something quietly impressive about drivers who maximise what they’ve got, and Ocon is quietly becoming one of the most dependable racers this season.

Would love to hear what others think – has he been under the radar, or are the midfield margins just too tight to stand out?","['absolutely wild way to orient a chart.', 'SO happy he left Alpine. He seems much happier', 'You can\'t really assess his ""race finish"" position in Emilia-Romagna, mostly because he didn\'t finish.\n\nOcon seems to be struggling in qualifying, but that\'s possibly due to three major factors:\n\n* Midfield is really tight, last week in Q1 there was only 0.312s between 3rd Lawson and 16th Stroll (first driver dropping out in Q1), with P17 Ocon (+0.347) and P18 Tsunoda (+0.352) also being really close. For comparison, 3rd Lawson was +0.345 slower than fastest Norris. Sure, on longer tracks gap seems to be relatively bigger, but even on ""longer"" track like Jeddah, between 5th Sainz and 16th Stroll, there also was only 0.4s gap.\n* Haas doesn\'t look like a good qualifying car in general. During *Steiner Era*, they often shone in qualifying, but later struggled with tyre wear in the race. That started to change with last year\'s car, focusing more on keeping tyres within operating temperature range. That cost them with qualifying performance, as it makes more difficult firing up the tyres. \n* Ocon struggles to keep up his quali pace compared to Bearman. Ollie often looks great in qualifying, especially with performances like Japan. This could be related to their driving styles, because...\n\nOcon looks like better tyre preserver of two Haas drivers. After the race, he was pretty convinced that they could\'ve gone for 1 stopper, but they would have to make 1st stint longer. Ollie seems to be struggling in that area a bit more, which is understandable, as he still is a relatively unexperienced driver, at least compared to a driver that\'s hanging around for like 9 years, having completed 150+ races.\n\nAnd one more thing - obviously, you\'re more likely to gain positions when you\'re starting P18 rather than when you\'re starting P7, but that\'s not changing one simple fact. He\'s sitting P9, ahead of faster cars in inexperienced hands (Hadjar), or experienced hands having even more inconsistent car (Alonso). Question remains how long will he be able to stay on that P9, as Sauber\'s form is significantly improving (Hulkenberg scored in last 3 races, including a cracking race in Spain), and Sainz at one moment will definitely get more luck and start scoring bigger points.', 'He has been very impressive in races but not seen much by the camera. A bit of a more subdued version of what Sainz used to be in 2019.\xa0\n\nThe fact that Bearman often outqualifies him and sometimes by a lot of places is worrying for Esteban, but he’s usually better in races. \xa0Haas as a team seem much much better in races than qualifyings.\xa0\n\nOcon’s performances in both China and Monaco are two of the best of the season. In China he got P5 after the Ferraris were disqualified and he made one of the best overtakes of the season on Antonelli.\xa0\n\nAnd in Monaco I do not think the car was as good as he made it look. Ocon’s always been really REALLY good around Monte Carlo and he’s a specialist around those streets.\xa0\n\nOverall he’s for sure in the conversation for a top ten driver this year. For me he falls somewhere in the 6-12 region, probably towards the bottom half of that.\xa0\n\nI feel as though Gasly and Ocon are a bit like the Perez and Hulkeburg of the 2010’s.', 'He’s been great. He gets a lot of hate, i think because he’s uncompromising but as really the only driver not born into/backed by a giant fortune, he’s had to scrap and fight just to get to F1 and stick around so long', 'This data visualization is absolutely diabolical 💀', '“Maestro” feels like a bit of an overstatement', 'The chart just seems like his results vary up and down each race.

That doesn\'t make sense though. His situation wasn\'t a dire one that necessitated an immediate pit. Furthermore, the mechanics were already in place with Lando\'s tires. Pitting Oscar first would increase chances of a mix-up.\n\nNow, Oscar doesn\'t respond until he gets to the end of the lap. As Tom reiterates that he wants best pace until target lap, Oscar tells him about the flat spot. Tom tells him to see how he does in clear air. \n\nIn the second sector, Tom tells him that the flatspot doesn\'t seem bad on the data and tells Oscar to ""let him know."" In the third sector, Oscar says that it\'s not pleasant but okay. They then do not pit at the end of Lap 21. \n\nThis is supported by the data that shows Oscar go faster than the previous laps and also faster than Lando\'s inlap. \n\nI assume that if Oscar had said or performed otherwise, they would have pitted on Lap 23. Remember that McLaren was also not ready to double-stack since they were presumably already in front of the box with Lando\'s tires when Oscar made his move. Thus, Lap 23 would have been the earliest (safest) time for them to pit.\n\nOn Lap 22, Oscar gets asked the 4 with delta vs. 1.5 behind question. He answers it at the end of Lap 22: 4 with delta.\n\nFor me, McLaren\'s actions seem very reasonable.', ""something is seriously wrong with the Alpine car. Last 2-3 races I think an argument could be made it's legitimatley the slowest car on the grid."", ""On a positive note, Racing Bulls are finding their footing in several places. It is fantastic to see Lawson get those points, and it bodes well for the sister team, knowing that not only Lawson does have his star moments for solid drives, but he and Hadjar can respectfully work on those collectively, whilst building up confidence and experience on their own as an individual driver. \n\nI don't normally agree with terms branded by the viewers of the sport, but in this instance, there is very little wonder why people are labelling a move to Red Bull from the sister team as a *demotion*. \n\nMore of this from VCARB, please! Sauber and VCARB picking up the pace is fun for the midfield battle in the standings, and I am excited to see them hop into the mix"", 'McLaren are handling it all ok so far, but if Oscar and Lando remain this close up to the last races, it will be all out war.', 'I know there have been some complaints about the message to Oscar about the move in turn 4 being too marginal, but I genuinely think/wonder if this is something they\'ve talked and agreed about as a team (either at the start of the season, or at the very least after Canada) that they will receive that kind of feedback in race if the situation warrants it. Andrea Stella has said in interviews that they have ""written our racing principles together with our drivers"", so it seems to me Lando and Oscar feel a strong sense of responsibility to be able to have such freedom to race and they take that responsibility seriously. I think Oscar and Lando know exactly how unique the situation they\'ve found themselves in with such freedom to race (without the need for the team to be too worried about other teams/drivers) and they don\'t take that lightly.', ""On a different topic I haven't really seen discussed too much, Williams had an absolutely terrible weekend. To multiple problems with Carlos's car starting in quali (I think he damaged it in a trip through the gravel), his car blowing up before the race, and Alex having a mechanical failure while he was P6, forcing him to retire. Hoping they rebound and have a good home race for Silverstone."", ""I may be mistaken, but at one point toward the end of the race, I thought there was a situation where Lando was lapping a group of three cars, and when he got by the final one, that car then looked to be trying to overtake Lando again and the commentary said that driver does have the right to try to unlap himself.\n\nAm I misremembering and/or misunderstanding something? It seems nonsensical that a car overtaken under a blue flag would be allowed to (immediately) pass the lead car again, since then you're right back into the blue flag where he has to let the leader by."", 'Very interested to see Bortoleto’s career. He might be the next great driver to come out of South America. I underestimated his quali pace, which is already quite decent compared to Hulk who is one of the top 1 lap guy. In junior career his race management was what stood out somewhat like Piastri. He very well might go to a top team in 3-4 years. Great rookie crop. Hadjar has been really impressive too.', 'Great to see Lawson build his confidence and also see social media get in behind him a bit. \n\nIt was very much make or break for the kid and I don’t think any of us can fully comprehend how bad getting booted from rbr after 2 races must have been.']",37,127,0.9,37,904,904,2,2,0.010000000000000009,2

Poached from Aston Martin on February 17, 2022, he will have only experienced 38 Grands Prix with the Enstone team . Brunon Famin, his replacement, had a one-year interim, logically shorter, but still longer than Oliver Oakes\' ten months on the pit wall.\n\n>The ejection seat of the Alpine principal position never left enough time for a single decision-maker. Between July 2023 and May 2025, the team had more different team principals than regular drivers. This lack of stability has seriously hampered the team\'s development in its quest for results in Formula 1 .\n\n>The 60-year-old Romanian-American was not helped by Luca de Meo, then head of the Renault group , and his demands for short-term results. ""I only spoke to him three times , "" he confided in an interview with The Race. ""  At one point he was very enthusiastic about poaching me from Aston Martin. He told me he needed someone with F1 experience. He seemed keen to do things right.""\n\n\n>Szafnauer joined Force India in 2009, when the team was sitting second to last in the standings with no points scored at the end of the previous season. He contributed to the team\'s gradual comeback, climbing the standings each year: 7th in 2010, 6th in 2011, 2012 and 2013, 5th in 2015 and 4th in 2016 and 2017.\n\n>Bought by Lawrence Stroll and renamed Racing Point in 2018, the team even achieved its first victory with Sergio Pérez\'s comeback at the Sakhir Grand Prix in 2020. This performance was confirmed once the team moved to Aston Martin with a podium finish for Sebastian Vettel in 2021 in Baku (then a second in Hungary) and nine for Fernando Alonso in 2023.\n\n>Szafnauer will not have had the same opportunity at Alpine, in particular because of Luca de Meo\'s expectations. ""The last time I spoke to him was in Montreal in 2023 [four rounds before his ousting in Belgium, Editor\'s note]. I explained to him that it would take time to implement a paradigm shift within the team. I told him how long it would take, to which he replied, \'I don\'t have that time. It has to happen faster.\'""\n\n\n>“Bad decisions by management always cause bad results on the track.”\nOf all the recruits Szafnauer made at Alpine, a large majority only stayed with the team for a few months before moving on. ""There\'s a great aerodynamicist from Red Bull , I think he\'s the only one still there , "" he recalls . ""My other recruits ultimately didn\'t come or left after only a few weeks. One of them was leading Apple\'s simulation program in Cupertino, among the best simulation engineers in the world.""\n\n>A resentment relieved by the difficulties encountered by Alpine since his departure, which Szafnauer almost welcomes. ""I\'m not pointing out anything that people can\'t see for themselves ,"" the Romanian-American exonerates himself. "" You only have to look at the constructors\' standings: they\'re last this year. It just shows that bad decisions by management always cause bad results on the track.""\n\n>The Italian\'s recent surprise resignation from his post as Renault Group CEO came as a surprise to Otmar Szafnauer. The manufacturer\'s sales were ""doing well,"" and the CEO reportedly negotiated a ""four-year contract extension"" with the diamond brand. Renault and Alpine\'s future in F1, he said, remains ""in the hands of the new guy. When Carlos Ghosn was there, he made the decisions for F1. Maybe [Flavio] Briatore is right and it won\'t change anything at all, I don\'t know.""\n\n\n>Amid rumors of Alpine\'s sale, given its recent performance, the Romanian-American can only point to the brand\'s philosophy and the team\'s financial results: ""I think Alpine will only sell electric cars in the near future. So there\'s not a big correlation between track and production vehicles,"" he comments. "" Maybe they\'ll say, \'We bought this team for next to nothing and it\'s now worth a billion and a half. Why not sell?\'""\n\n>Coming from a former team manager claiming to be supported by a manufacturer for a new team project, the message seems almost inciting.', ""When asked about this Mr. de Meo had this to say: \n\nHe wasn't corrupt enough."", 'After watching some of his interviews, Omar has become one of my favorite characters in the F1 universe.

1lo8ky9,The fixture order & the opportunities that could come from changing it,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lo8ky9/the_fixture_order_the_opportunities_that_could/,2025-06-30, Discussion,"The season has been chopped about chasing US and Arab money, but going to/from America 3 times and to/from West Asia twice seems rather silly. 

Baku, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi, Abu Dhabi (5 races)

China, Japan, Singapore, Australia (4 races)

Canada, Mexico, Brazil, US x3 (6 races)

[Rightly] lots of Europe (9 races)

These now look like 4 logical race series that make up the world championship. A European series, an American series, a Pacific Series, and a West Asian series. If the fixtures were shuffled so that these blocks were run consecutively, the logistics would get cheaper and the environmental impact would be lower - but I think it has more potential to generate interest in ""continental"" points/trophies. Winning all 4 series in a year would be a ""Grand Slam"" season for a driver/team - a more challenging thing to achieve than ""just"" taking the world title, especially for drivers in leading teams with a fairly evenly matched driver in the other car. 

There would be 4 end-of-series races that are much more likely to be a down-to-the-wire points shootout than the final race of the season is. Teams not in title contention could split their 2nd seat between drivers to hire a local and boost interest / sponsorship. There's another set of sponsorship opportunities for the series themselves too.

Could anyone see this happening? ","['There are other factors\nWet/rain season - Japan, Miami. China \nHolidays - Vegas \nExtreme heat - Middle East, Texas,', 'As with all of these discussions, travel and regionalisation is one of a massive number of considerations that go into making a calendar.\n\nIf you were planning a season based purely on those things, then this maybe makes sense. \n\nWhen you factor in climate, other sporting events and holidays nearby, pre-existing contracts, races that have paid huge amounts of money to have the ""prestige races"" (first and last for example) etc. then calendars like this will never happen.\n\nA few examples:\n\n- Bahrain has paid a higher hosting fee to have a contract to be the first race most seasons, and Australia has a contract to be first in years that Bahrain is not first.\n\n- Abu Dhabi has paid to have a contract for be the final race.\n\n- Miami cannot be hosted after August because of the NFL season, and after May there\'s much higher risk of tropical storms affecting the weekend.\n\n- Most of the venues for races in the Middle East are too hot to be host between April and October.', 'Everytime I see a ""this should be the calendar order to cut down on travel and carbon emissions""\n\nI have to remind myself that everyone flys home/to base. Including equipment and cars at the end of every weekend. \n\nIt\'s important for European races to all be grouped because you can haul by truck. But let\'s be real. They flew out to Bahrain for testing. Back to England. Australia. Back to England, China, England, Japan, England, Bahrain, England etc etc etc.', 'So you are proposing that everyone stays on the road for 3/4 of the season.', ""I don't know if it's still true but they used to have two sets of equipment which is why they alternate often between continents. One set is shipping as the other set is in use."", 'Grouping races together is not more sustainable since it means the freight has to be flown instead of shipped to meet the timescales of races being next to each other in the calendar.\nThere are multiple sets of freight and the calendar is currently organised to try and minimise freight flights.', 'No. It is too different than the current F1 format. \n\nThe logistic of F1 are well documented. I doubt the logistic saving are something the teams care about. It is pocket change for them. \n\nThe format seems nice on paper. Europe is much well connected than the rest. America is really large. Probably a travel from Europe to US is cheaper than from Brazil to Mexico. Similarly Eastern Asia, Australia Singapore.\n\nThere are several F4 series around the world. Local sponsors would put some money, but not a lot. Participants drop some series because they are too far and too expensive to cover costs.', 'Here\'s the positives. I like the idea about hyping up different things in a Grand Slam type way. But, like with golf and tennis, a grand slam doesn\'t mean they\'re together in the calendar, it generally means throughout the calendar, so I don\'t think it would need to be for this either. There could be regional leaderboards for driver and constructor. Note that Africa might be added, so that would have to be given a region. South Africa doesn\'t exactly fit geographically with anything else, but that doesn\'t mean it shouldn\'t be added to the calendar. If something was going to by hyped up with separate leaderboards, I think rather than location, street circuit vs road course could be it. There\'s a lot of middle ground honestly in F1, and some ""street"" circuits are actually more like traditional circuits, because some are purpose built, but they could assign them.\n\nScheduling alone is a difficult mathematic problem. Venues have other events. There\'s weather patterns to consider.\n\nThen there\'s the thing people here never talk about. Monza and Imola have been very far apart in the calendar for good reason. Because I\'m sure it\'s one of the more likely races for people to go to both of. If you had them on back to back weeks, don\'t you think more people would go to both? Spa and Zandvoort are on opposite sides of summer break as well.\n\nYou might say, yeah, that make sense, we can jump around Europe because everything in Europe is close enough together, so we can avoid putting races near each other next to each other to improve fan experience. But then, when you do that, you\'re admitting that you don\'t mind making it better for Europe, but not for the rest of the world.\n\nIf someone in Australia is going to go to two races, the second is probably Singapore, third is Japan. If you have them back to back weeks, people are much less likely to go to more than one.\n\nIf someone in North America goes to multiple races, it\'s probably two in North America for most of them. If all of them are back to back to back, that makes it much less likely. They are trying Miami and Canada together next year, so we\'ll see how that goes. Except, as always when there\'s a week or more between races, all the drivers and most of the staff will go back to Europe between races. People just don\'t want to be away from home that long when there are two weekends off.', ""Tell me you don't understand climate without telling me you don't understand climate""]",0,22,0.33,0,92,92,0,0,0.0,0
