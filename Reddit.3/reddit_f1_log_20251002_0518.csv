They are manually operated, but are they restricted to zones/speeds or not? Can you activate them regardless of gaps ahead or do you need a trigger to ""unlock"" them? 


Then the overtake mode:

Again manually operated, and everybody agrees it's kinda like DRS where you need to hit a certain gap to unlock it

But is it the sane as DRS zones? Or you can reach that gap anywhere on the track? 

Then about using it, can drivers activate it anywhere? Or is it again zone/speed limited? If so that would take away 90% of the cool as it would be basically DRS again, except worse because then you get passed right away by having no battery left, no? 
","['>First the The X/Y mode:\n\n>They are manually operated, but are they restricted to zones/speeds or not? Can you activate them regardless of gaps ahead or do you need a trigger to ""unlock"" them?\n\nIt works like DRS now (manually and with zones), but it will be enabled at all times, so it no longer requires a 1s gap to the car ahead.\n\n>Then the overtake mode:\n\n>Again manually operated, and everybody agrees it\'s kinda like DRS where you need to hit a certain gap to unlock it\n\n>But is it the sane as DRS zones? Or you can reach that gap anywhere on the track?\n\nThere will be one detection line and one activation line. It is then available until the driver crosses the activation line again whilst being outside the detection gap. It is, of course, effectively limited by the way it works as it can only provide a boost at high speeds.', ""For [overtaking mode](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/explained-2026-power-unit-regulations-fia.68izKQ2tn1voQPWvgLVMXN):\n> \n> How does it work?

1nvdvg7,What are your predictions for next years silly season?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nvdvg7/what_are_your_predictions_for_next_years_silly/,2025-10-01, Discussion,"It doesn‚Äôt look like much is going to change for 2026 bar some Red Bull shenanigans but 2027 could be a crazy one for a multitude of reasons,

The three drivers that fans think are the best (Verstappen, Leclerc and Russell) are all uncertainties. Verstappen is probably wanted by every team that isn‚Äôt papaya and has an uncertain year ahead at Red Bull. This week reports came out Leclerc‚Äôs management is exploring options for 2027 while Toto seems to be unwilling to give Russell a contract beyond 2026.

We also have champions on the verge of retirement (Alonso, Hamilton), while many other veterans are likely in the final stages of their careers (Hulkenberg, Bottas, Perez).

The current rookies may all enter the earliest phase of their primes in 2027 (Antonelli, Bearman, Bortoleto, Hadjar) and may well be sought by top teams.

And many many young prospects are ready to do battle in F2 and F3 for a place at the pinnacle of motorsport (Dunne, Lindblad, Fornorolli, Camara, Tsolov, Ugochukwu, Slater, Nakamura Berta, McLoughlin).

This is all under the backdrop of one of if not the biggest ever regulation change that will likely trigger mass movement as the top teams may no longer be de facto top teams and some midfield teams look well placed to step up to the big game.

And of the 11 teams, nearly all of them seem to have aspirations of becoming works teams in the future so 2027 may well set a picture of the future of the sport as drivers decide what projects look the best for them.
