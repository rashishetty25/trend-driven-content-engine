1o4aorn,Engine Supplier Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o4aorn/engine_supplier_question/,2025-10-11, Technical,"I've been watching F1 for 5 seasons now and I've always wondered something about how being an engine supplier or customer team works. Let's say you're Mercedes, and you've built the best engine. Now you have a competitive edge on Honda or Ferrari. But if you then sell your engine to Aston or McLaren, how do you maintain a competitive advantage? Do you tell them nothing about how it works? Do you detune it in some way and they have to figure out how to squeeze performance out of it? Or do you then just give up that advantage and totally rely on the chassis and aero being better than Aston/McLaren? Hopefully my question makes sense.","['By the regs the PU supplied to all Works or Customer teams must be the same.\xa0\n\nThe slight performance differences come way earlier in the design stage, where a Works competitor like Mercedes or Aston next season can fully design their chassis to be perfectly compatible with the PU (or the other way around).\n\nEverything down to the location of a coolant hose, how electrical harnesses are routed can be collaborated on with a works PU. A Customer team will have to work around what’s provided to them.', 'In the past customer engines would not have the same performance but that is now illegal. Customers would also have very little say in the engine packaging which would also cause issues for their development but that has changed as well. McLaren gets all the information about next years engine at the same time as Mercedes and also has a say in packaging and other configuration options. Which means any performance difference between McLaren and Mercedes will not be caused by the engine. Not sure if Williams has the same deal as McLaren is paying extra to have that information and input.', ""There's specific rules against all of these things.  Engine manufacturers can't sell competitors detuned engines or keep proprietary secrets anymore.  They have to master their own engine just like anyone else.  the only advantage they have is that they have the minds that designed the engine on staff to give them some pointers."", ""Well, the cars need more than an engine to go fast around a track. Ask yourself why McClaren is faster than Mercedes the last two years when they're using the same engine, but Williams is slower than both. Everything outside of the engine is important too."", ""The whole idea is that generally, if the engine and the rest of the car are made within the same company, the engineers who developed the engine get to directly share the minute details that can end up making all the difference in F1. But if a customer team's aero department does an outstanding job, they can overturn that potential advantage, as McLaren have done the last 2 seasons."", "">But if you then sell your engine to Aston or McLaren, how do you maintain a competitive advantage?\xa0\n\nConsidering where Mclaren is at, clearly they don't keep the advantage. but generally controlling the car and the engine design is beneficial."", 'I also read that the engine supplier creates their engine to be optimised for their associated oils and lubricants sponsor. So Mercedes engines out of the box are optimised for Petronas. When they’re sold, the customer has to adapt them to their own oil supplier. Not sure how much truth there is to that but it sounds pretty feasible.', ""To add on to what everyone has said here, \n\nOil and fuel suppliers also have a factor in general performance, not just in HP but in reliability, thermals and fuel efficiency. \n\nIn addition to this, there will also be slight variation between each engine produced. \n\nSay engine A has 1000 hp, Engine B has 1001, Engine C has Engine 997hp. The works team will take Engine A and Engine B while Engine C will be allocated to customer teams. Ofc there won't be cases such as McLaren getting 950hp engines while Mercedes having 1050hp as there are already rules inplaced as everybody else has mentioned."", ""I think the engines need to be mechanically all the same, they cannot sell de-tuned engines anymore (I don't know when it stopped). But the software can still be different, engine mapping can be different and custom oil and fuel can also make a difference.\n\nOne example is Mercedes and their party mode (banned for a while now) that was not given to the customer teams.\n\nThey likely also have better diagnostic data about the engine and can run it more aggresively. The customer teams probably need to be more conservative to protect the engine."", ""The main thing between customer and manufacturer is data and design. McLaren get the engine and design their car around that. Mercedes can design the engine and car at the same time.\n\n\nIt gets complicated when a manufacturer also has a team (Ferrari mercedes) and customers as in theory the customer will always be second best. However a car is not just an engine. It's also a gearbox, suspension, aero and driver.\xa0\n\n\nHowever the engine is the one of the biggest things when it comes to the cars historically and so being the main or only engine runner is a big deal, you have your teams reputation and the engine makers too (honda for example, fuck it Renault too deciding not to make engines anymore)\xa0""]",92,66,0.88,92,61,61,26,11,0.0,26
