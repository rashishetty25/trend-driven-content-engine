So at the peak of the winter break, I ask your predictions on how the 2025 season will end in terms of rivalry of Williams pair Sainz and Albon. 

You can predict any statistics you want, from race&quali H2H to WDC points if you feel lucky.

I'll start:
Race Head to Head: 14-9 in favor of Sainz (I reckon there will be 1 race they'll both DNF'd)

Qualifying Head to Head: 13-11 in favor of Sainz

My hope is that the pace Albon showed in his first races at RB (and started to recover towards the end of 2020) is more of who he is up against the best, rather than the pace he had in most of 2020. Not sure if that makes sense, but I think about those races where he got punted from a probable win and a probable 2nd place and am always wondering what if? He’s talked a lot about how everything that happened at RB really messed with his head over time and he seems like he’s in a much stronger place mentally now.\n\nIf he gets his clock cleaned then he’s probably done in F1 after his current contract (and I suppose before if it’s really bad, but I think that would take a lot), which would be sad as I really like him as a person, but I don’t think he has enough stock to survive that when Williams has Colapinto (who I think is overhyped, but is promising) in the wings.', 'Sainz is going to have him for a light supper', 'I disagree with basically every prediction.

If they don't, I expect Albon to lead the way and Sainz to come back towards the end of the season, with Albon ending up leading driver because of a fast start.\n\nTo be honest, as to who scores the most points, that will probably be down to luck and retirements.\n\nAs a pairing, it's very, very strong, and probably more than Williams' performances deserve""]",77,147,0.81,77,1448,1448,6,2,0.010000000000000009,6

Let’s me know your Top 3.

My predictions:

1. WDC Champion: Charles Leclerc
2. WDC Vice-Champion: Lewis Hamilton
3. Third Place: Lando Norris

I do believe that if Ferrari provides a Championship level car (or even close), Charles & Lewis are both the favorites (I believe they will provide a very good car hence my top 2 but they are interchangeable). 

I think McLaren will have a very very good car but Lando isn’t ready yet to challenge and same goes for Oscar, he is to inconsistent.

Regarding Redbull and verstappen, unfortunately I don’t see them delivering a good car for max to be able to challenge for the title next year.

Finally, concerning Mercedes It’s been 3 years and they still don’t seem to understand the current regulations and haven’t show the capacity to build a championship level car. So Goerge won’t be anywhere near the top, tho he might win 1 or 2 gps.","['1. Max Verstappen\n2. Lando Norris\n3. Charles Leclerc\n4. Oscar Piastri\n5. Lewis Hamilton', ""1. Charles Leclerc\n\n2.
