1kfh86y,Oscars Racecraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfh86y/oscars_racecraft/,2025-05-05, Discussion,"Am surprised it isn't talked about more. I think Oscar is the only driver to cleanly pass Max multiple times now, and he makes it look easy. This last race clearly showed the difference between him and Norris, and well everyone else. 


When Oscar made the move it looked like of course, why doesn't everyone just undercut Max when he tries to go deep and push off the track. Of course this is easier said then done. 


Yet, I am constantly impressed at how clean Oscar is. It stands out as Max's overtakes are quite aggressive and messy as he basically challenges contact. I think Raikkonen would be the last guy that I can remember being that good/clean. Yet Oscar just makes it look so easy, hearing Max not having anything to complain about on the team radio except his own car when passed is so different. Than the usual ""he pushed me off track"" etc...","['Oscar is a very confident and cool driver, he doesn‚Äôt doubt his decision.

He can take it to max the way I've seen only Lewis and Charles do, when they had a car under them.\nI hope he can keep this momentum up through the whole season."", ""Oscar seems very confident in his ability, he makes very quick decisions and continues to impress me.\n\nHe's 24, and only in his third season. While the McLaren is very good, he is definitely taking advantage of having the best car and is being bold when opportunities come up.\n\nIt's genuinely impressive to watch, him and Kimi are definitely making me excited about the future of the sport on the driver side.\n\nSome of Oscar's passes seem to come out of nowhere, he pulled one on Leclerc last year at Baku, and did one more recently on Hamilton that was just beautiful.\n\nI think he'll only continue to get better and unless the new TD changes things radically, I have to imagine Oscar wins this championship."", 'One thing to note is this year is the first with the new overtaking rules. Overtaking is very much who can make it to the Apex first without locking up. Before, you were obliged to leave the other car racing room', ""It certainly doesn't look easy to pass Max, and the car helps a lot. But for sure he is really good"", 'I feel like People actually doesn‚Äôt talk about race craft much except it is dirty.

1kffk71,Piastri reminds me of Alain Prost and Fernando Alonso,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kffk71/piastri_reminds_me_of_alain_prost_and_fernando/,2025-05-05, Discussion,"He is one of these drivers that is ruthless when he needs to be but also calm and methodical when it is called for. The way he handled getting past Max this race was a perfect example. He's also one of these drivers that I feel uses his racecraft to maximise results especially on Sunday. Both Alonso and Prost are great qualifiers but where they really stood out against their competitors was their racecraft and race vision, as well aa their competotive mentality. 

Piastri has some amazing overtakes just like the ones Fernando pulls off, like his move on Leclerc in Baku, Norris in Monza, Hamilton in Australia and now the move on Max, amongst others (Austria and Spa) He is also very consistent which are the two strengths of Prost and Alonso. Even when they didn't nail the setup that weekend or didn't have the fastest car, they would maximise the result or atleast finish P2 behind their main rival, (e.g Prost vs Senna or Alonso vs Schumacher) Piastri has done this by always qualifying within a tenth of Pole up until this week and always making the best of the situation despite setbacks (recovering in Australia) 

This season he is especially benefiting from this as his rival - Norris, has similar pace (arguably perhaps slightly better at times) but doesn't have the consistency nor the racecraft to benefit. I am looking forward to seeing Piastri develop and he may well become a driver who is similar in approach and hopefully results as either Alonso or Prost, although the bar is still very high as these two drivers are two of the GOATs imo.","['Great points of comparison; from what I have read about him, his work ethic also stands out. The way he has honed his qualifying skills to extract the last 2/10ths consistently is a testament to his dedication. His success is well deserved and I hope to see him improve even more! \n\nHe has the making of a legend in future imo', 'I agree. Piastri is what Prost always have been during his career, a man of raceday. It reminds me a lot how Prost conducted his McLaren and then Williams both against Lauda and Senna. Exploiting opportunities and results. Chilling blood, clinical. While Max reminds me of 1992 and 1993 Senna, racing with his ass and soul against a much better team with his teammate nowhere near in sight. Norris is... Idk, a better Damon Hill maybe right now. He is good, he can be great, but he definitely NEEDS to be better at his own mind. Maybe he needs the 2-3 years Hill needed too.', 'I was thinking the same to be honest but felt like I might get crucified for even making the comparison. Not always the fastest, but fast enough and gets the job done consistently this year.', ""Oscar definitely reminds me of Fernando a lot but I do see hints of Schumacher especially in how he can simultaneously be very quick while still thinking of strategy.\n\nI'm definitely on the Piastri hype train."", ""I love Oscar. His racecraft, overtakes, how calm and collected he is. We haven't seen him defending a lot, but when he did (Baku 2024), he was as aggressive as when he's attacking.\nThe two overtakes on Lewis this year (Australia and Jeddah)... Chef's kiss.\xa0"", 'The comparison the Norris is in my opinion accurate, it‚Äôs mostly racecraft that separates them. Being 1/10th faster consistently isn‚Äôt enough this year for Lando, but making fewer crucial mistakes is plenty for Piastri', ""In my mind he's what Kimi Raikkonen would have been if Kimi was just a little bit nerdy."", ""Oscar is about as fast as Lando (it varies from track to track), but he seems to be able to win even when he isn't the fastest. His cool head and measured racecraft mean he will always be there to pick up those wins"", '100% agree, Prost and Alonso are the best analogs. One of the most impressive things for me is how he‚Äôs handled Max. It actually started last season at Abu Dhabi where he showed Max he‚Äôs willing to crash and won‚Äôt back down. This season he‚Äôs used this and Max‚Äôs determination to never be out braked to force a mistake at Australia, Saudi and now Miami. He‚Äôs so methodical about how he does things and the results were there for all to see yesterday when he beat his slightly quicker teammate. With the caveat that he only has 2 and a bit seasons in F1 Lando still has a tiny advantage over long stints because of his experience with these tires. Oscar is better to much better at nearly everything else. He makes fewer mistakes, drives far more intelligently and takes what‚Äôs on the table nearly every time. Lando can beat him in any given race but Oscar will win the season every time because of this. He‚Äôs a killer and I expect him to school Lando when they inevitably go wheel to wheel the same way Max does because Lando has made his self doubt so public for all to see.\xa0']",126,94,0.71,126,580,580,4,0,0.010000000000000009,4

[...] At worst, Colapinto may be a crash risk, and may not be a superstar in the making - the sample set of a part-season at Williams is too small to know for sure on both counts - but he is a proven point scorer already and is a driver with ability.\n\nThis is something that I really agree with. Yea, Doohan was dealt an unfair and terrible hand, but it's not as if Colapinto was out of reach to Albon as a rookie with little preparation last year. I think everyone can agree, especially with his performance so far this season, that Albon is a fantastic driver.\n\nColapinto crashed a lot, but most importantly he had the pace. I believe that people just don't like the idea of him on the grid because he brings with him *very* annoying people.\n\nUltimately, this is another self-inflicted gunshot in the driver management side of things for Alpine. There was no need to announce Doohan that early last season, and they wasted 6 races on a driver that they gave one of the worst possible conditions to debut on."", 'Probably a bad take but drivers like Bearman, Colapinto and Hadjar kind of sealed Doohans fate. They came in an immediately showed something even if it wasn‚Äôt really expected of them. \nF1 is so competitive and tight these days that teams can‚Äôt really afford to keep a driver who may or may not become good over time. Sure Doohan may become really good (he arguably should be decent considering his testing programme) but really in 6/7 races can it be said he‚Äôs been anything other than underwhelming? (even factoring in the fact the cars a tractor). I don‚Äôt expect Colapinto to set the world alight but he compared well to Albon (who is having a season right now).

Comparing Doohan to other drivers of his age is interesting. Colapinto finished 4th in his second F3 season with just two 2 sprint wins, whereas Doohan finished 2nd in his second season with 3 feature race wins and 1 sprint win. Their first F2 seasons are hard to compare with Colapinto getting called up to Williams before it  finished.\n\nDoohan's second season of F2 would probably have been a championship winning season if not for the setup/chassis issues (depending on who you believe) Doohan experienced in the first half of the season. He outscored the entire grid in the second half of the season to finish runner up to a highly rated Th√©o Pourchaire, who at that point was into his 4th F2 season.\n\nDoohan conclusively (imo) had a better F3/F2 junior career compared to Liam Lawson. Doohan only finished 21 points behind Lawson in F2 despite it being Lawson's second season compared to Doohan's first.\n\nF2 and F3 is littered with drivers who should have had F1 careers, so Doohan can count himself somewhat lucky regardless, but I think a lot of people have passed judgement on his speed without actually watching any of his junior career.

1kfjgbg,Are the 2025 racing rules killing side-by-side battles?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfjgbg/are_the_2025_racing_rules_killing_sidebyside/,2025-05-05, Discussion,"The 2025 changes to racing rules are making proper wheel-to-wheel racing, especially over multiple corners, nearly impossible.

[Video - How F1's secret racing rules have changed for 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gbTAHyzkrY)[Article - The new F1 racing rules that sealed Verstappen penalty](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/revealed-new-f1-2025-racing-rules-verstappen-jeddah-penalty/)  
The above video and article by THE RACE explains these changes well but I will give a summary below:

Under the new rules, if a driver is overtaking on the¬†*inside*¬†(and they are in control and within track limits),¬†**they no longer have to leave space for the car on the**¬†***outside***¬†**at corner exit**. That‚Äôs a major shift from 2024, where both drivers were expected to leave each other room if they were side-by-side at the apex.

Because of this rule change, if a driver overtaking on the inside manages to get alongside the wing mirror of the car on the outside, the car on the outside effectively has to give up the corner. The inside driver can now legally run them out of space on exit, so there‚Äôs little incentive to stay side-by-side. As a result, we‚Äôre unlikely to see drivers hanging it around the outside anymore, which basically kills the chance of multi-corner battles.

https://preview.redd.it/jl0tjjo6d0ze1.png?width=1612&format=png&auto=webp&s=e093fee9a8b09a072921ff232e44bd2ab3b7e79f

This rule change is why¬†**Piastri's Lap 1 Turn 1 incident** in Jeddah¬†was deemed legal. Under the 2024 rules, this move would likely have resulted in a penalty.

**TLDR: Inside car just divebombs, outside car either backs out or gets run off. Not much of a battle.**

Another key 2025 rule change concerns overtaking around the outside. Under the new guidelines, a driver attempting a move on the outside must now be¬†**ahead at the apex**¬†to be entitled to space on corner exit. Simply being¬†**alongside**, as was sufficient under the 2024 rules, no longer guarantees that right. This makes outside overtakes significantly harder and discourages side-by-side racing, as drivers will be less likely to attempt moves around the outside.

This rule likely explains why Verstappen wasn‚Äôt penalized for forcing Norris off in¬†**Miami Lap 1 Turn 2**¬†‚Äî Norris was only alongside, not ahead, so Verstappen wasn‚Äôt required to leave room.","[""So once the car on the inside is ahead, they have the right to the whole track? That's beyond stupid."", 'The interesting thing is that these changes resulted from a meeting with all drivers in Qatar last year, after criticism that drivers overtaking on the inside were being penalised too often.\n\nRussell spoke in an [interview](https://www.skysports.com/f1/news/12433/13262139/qatar-gp-f1-drivers-fia-stewards-hold-productive-meeting-to-discuss-racing-rules-after-max-verstappen-and-lando-norris-controversy) about it:\n\n>""If you are able to stay on the circuit [when overtaking on the inside] you are in your right to run the driver wide, as it has been for all of us since go-karts,"" he said.\n\nThis is exactly what the drivers wanted (to be able to run the defending car off the road) and is more consistent with lower category motorsport compared to previous versions, according to Russell.', 'Absolutely yes', ""Yes. Take a look at the Ocon and Hamilton battle. Absolutely unreal battling by both and it was 100% fair. And Ocon didn't actually have to leave Lewis space according to the new rules (albeit that space was largely the run off, but such is the track layout), he didn't because he can actually race wheel to wheel. Historically he just chooses not to when it's a teammate lol.\n\nWheel to wheel racing has never been as low quality as it is now. And it's not because the drivers are incapable, it's because they're choosing not to because the rulebook is dumb as fuck and seemingly written in a way solely to cause debate. You couple that with stewards making inconsistent decisions every single weekend and you end up in a scenario where nobody actually knows where the baseline is because it changes every week."", 'Yeah pretty much.\n\nWhat we have today isn\'t good racing by any stretch. The amount of actual good racing we had over the last years is very little. And no, i wouldnt call 1 random overtake during a DRS zone as ""good racing"". \n\nI\'m reffering to actual battles on track, like Norris vs Verstappen in COTA last year, or Charles vs Max in 2022 or their other countless battles they had.\n\nOther sports have much better racing than F1 and it\'s super sad that it got to this point in my opinion.', 'Yes', ""The rules were bad before, people heard they are going to change some things for 2025 and thought maybe it will get better.

Thanks!","[""The RB21 performance varies so much from track to track it's insane... Max was on par and maybe even faster than Piastri in Saudi and here he was 8 tenths slower."", ""I am as disheartened as everybody else to see Ferrari going back into the disorganised, lost figures of themselves in the team, but in my opinion, demanding for Fred Vasseur's exit from the team is simply absurd\n\nDating back to when Luca Di Montezemolo destabilized the Holy Trinity of Ferrari itself, it seems that the team is unable to find middle ground with their values and the prospects to win on certain aspects in a cultural sense. Whether it is the unwillingness to break out of traditional norms to take risks in exchange for chances of winning or the organisation of the fold crumbling under pressure, changing team principals on a constant basis will not solve the problem at hand, especially since Vasseur was the man who narrowly led Ferrari to the top, had it not been for the middle stretch of the races. There is a case to be made with Binotto, but constantly being in the cycle of  shifting, blaming and replacing would only send the organisation back to square one, and fumbling over themselves\n\nThat being said, I also believe Vasseur needs to iron these issues out if Ferrari wants to salvage the rest of their season. Miscommunication between drivers and engineers are not the most unheard of, but for it to be a recurring theme is insane. Neither Leclerc nor Hamilton had adequate pace to catch Antonelli, and they barely kept Sainz at bay in a car believed to be much weaker than theirs. The issue that the drivers are figuring out the car's strengths and weaknesses, and trying to salvage what they can with its characteristics is concerning at this stage of the season. By changing the car's philosophy *(which I get the reasoning but I wouldn't have particularly been on board with)*, the gamble did not pay off well\n\nWith the race where they can bring upgrades coming in, I hope they find something. If that doesn't work, then I can only hope Vasseur would use the time and his efforts to fix the team. It will not be easy, if my understanding of Ferrari's rigid rules are factual, but if the team wants to win, then the bigwigs really need to consider these aspects first before anything. A lot of Ferrari's future is on them"", 'Pretty good race,more tyre wear and a second stop or a full safety car would have made it better obviously .\n\nBut the Mclaren pace is downright insane.Multiple VSC and losing time to Max for 10 laps each...and still ending the race 30 seconds ahead of third place is pure dominance.', 'From my second time attending this race (or any F1 event) in person:\n\n1) Turn 18 is a better spot to sit than turn 12. Glad I tried something different this time but I‚Äôd do another spot before sitting at the ‚Äòbeach‚Äô in Miami again. \n2) But, my vantage point made the gap in the field even more outstanding in the last third of the race where Lando and Oscar would come around 11, 12 and 13 and disappear and their sound would disappear. Like‚Ä¶ quiet on the track except for piped in commentary. Then came George and his sound would lessen and then Max and his engine noise dissipated and then‚Ä¶ everyone else. The McLarens were just in a different universe. \n3) I recognize Max as an incredible talent and I‚Äôm a big Lewis fan but I also like having many winners and contenders so I think this year has been fun. I‚Äôll be just as bored if McLaren walks away with all the wins  this year (could be likely!) than I would be if Max did it again or if we were in the Lewis/Merc dominant era . So, I like the dominance shifting and the fun that brings to us, the fans. \n4) Last for me was seeing Albon punching in the top third and every time I saw him go by I was impressed with his chasing of Max and then Ferrari.

It also made a great viewing experience to watch how the end of the long straight goes to see how far the leading car has to defend offline, and builds your anticipation for Turn 1.\n\nThe race settled down quite a bit after the VSC as the cars were mostly sorted in order of performance, but the Lando/Piastri/Verstappen battles was probably my favourite part of this season so far.', ""30+ sec down the road when not even leading from T1 is really a painful gap for everyone not named McLaren.

Lando kept trying the switchback instead of going outside so Max didn‚Äôt have to brake so hard and was able to carry more speed through the corner and keep the position.\n\nLando really needs to try something new when battling Max because it‚Äôs just so predictable and Max is completely in his head.', ""Pretty clear dominance by the MacLaren team and driver. \n\nMax in RBR and Mercs are fighting for 2nd/3rd teams.

1kfnfh0,Stefano Domenicali and Liberty Media deserve a lot more criticism for their handling of the calendar,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfnfh0/stefano_domenicali_and_liberty_media_deserve_a/,2025-05-05, Discussion,"I'll preface this by saying that I totally get the need for the sport to expand and for certain races to be included on the calendar. Commercial considerations do have to come into play if F1 is going to be profitable, so I'm not naive enough to think that all of the races that are currently on the calendar for money reasons shouldn't be there.

However, it beggars belief that Domenicali and others at Liberty Media are running roughshod over the calendar in a way that's beginning to threaten the sport's DNA and apart from the odd grumble, there is nobody within the sport questioning any of it, or anybody in the media willing to hold them to account for it.

In the last few years we've seen France and Germany disappear from the calendar. Imola is set to go at the end of this year. Zandvoort is going at the end of 2026 and Spa is set to go onto a rotational deal. Barcelona is out of contract after next season and its future you'd think must be under some threat as well. We're entering a situation where it's entirely feasible that the 2028 season could feature just six core European races, if you don't include Baku, out of a 24-race calendar. 

Even those fans who aren't as bothered with the traditions of the sport must realise that it's going way too far now. It's important for F1 to be a global sport, but it's also important if it is to thrive long-term that it stays true to its roots and builds a calendar around the historic races that for decades have been at the heart of its foundations.

And then that brings me onto the decision to give Miami a contract extension to 2041, and regardless of the popularity or success of the event, to commit to extending a partnership that has run for just four years for another SIXTEEN is an utterly insane business decision. Extensions of that nature should be reserved only for events that have a track record of delivering races over many decades and where absolutely zero doubts exist about the promoter's ability to deliver it. To give that to such a new event, and one that has ranked among the least popular with fans since it was first introduced, carries enormous risk and really should raise serious questions about the leadership of Formula One. 

Not only that, but it's a total lack of respect for where the sport has come from, and yet there is nobody holding Domenicali and co for account for it. If World Tennis was threatening to remove Wimbledon and the French Open as Grand Slams or World Golf doing the same with the Masters or the Open while simultaneously signing 15-year agreements for unproven events they would be getting pelters. Like them or not, Monaco, Silverstone, Spa, Monza, France, Germany and other core European events are what has made Formula One what it is. That we're in a situation where several of those races have disappeared or are in the process of becoming rotational while other, far less valuable races consistently get 10-15 year contract extensions is not just sad, but it's indicative of the reckless leadership that Domenicali is overseeing. It's doubly disappointing when you consider he's from a proper motorsport background and should therefore understand the importance of upholding traditions.

Liberty's policy with the calendar may well work short-term and help bolster revenues, but if in a few years' time the DTS-inspired boom has died off and the Netflix generation of fans have died off, it faces being left in a very precarious position if you have a calendar full of dull, uninspired circuits in countries with little or no motorsport tradition. NASCAR acts as a cautionary tale here. 

Meanwhile, nobody within the sport seems interested in questioning what is happening, and that's a very, very sad thing indeed. 

","['It‚Äôs a matter of commercial viability, and has been for a while. Many cut events are cut because event hosts decided it wasn‚Äôt worth the money (or loss of).\n\nIf an event host believes they can fill seats, you can guarantee they‚Äôll be at the table as it is always TBC who stays on the calendar.

1kfxzsk,Forcing a penalty for overtaking off track,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfxzsk/forcing_a_penalty_for_overtaking_off_track/,2025-05-06, Discussion,"So I just had an interesting thought

This part weekend we saw Lando overtake Max off track and give the position back. 


Under the current rule set it is up to the team to do this preemptively or face a possible penalty from the stewards.

Now question has nothing to do with whether Lando was right or Max was right. 

Instead, in a hypothetical situation, let's say car A overtakes car B off track and car B immediately pits (immediately not necessity being the next corner but let's say within a lap). 

Now car A CAN'T possibly give the position back (especially if car A just made a stop... It can be maybe argued that if car A needed to pit anyways it just forces them to do it right away and to give up track position after both cars have pitted) 

Either way though, by boxing car B, the team FORCES car A top do ""something"" or to simply eat the penalty. Now in most cases I imagine car A to just pit +1 lap after B and IF they remain ahead to give the position up and continue fighting but there's going to be some scenarios where that +1 pit timing REALLY screws that team's strategy up. 


I do wonder what stewards would do in that situation as they're not ""supposed"" to take these other factors into account and ONLY look at the move itself to determine the legality. 

Or the flip side of this argument would be what if it was this scenario

Car A overtakes car B offtrack in a VERY blatant manner but Car A immediately pits at the next possible opportunity. If car B does not put, did car A constitute ""giving the position back""? One might ask what the advantage gained would have been but track position matters and would confer an advantage. This would be further complicated if car B also immediately pits and car B's garage was further down the pit lane because car B would have temporarily regained it's position. 

With the style that some drivers have (honestly it's 90% max) this certainly seems like something that should be on strategist minds even though on the face of it this seems like a pretty rare scenario. 

An overtake off track comes with a 5 or 10 seconds penalty (it should be 10 but sometimes the lower it on a discretionary basis) so that's like half a pitstop and isn't something to be ignored even if it is something you're going to see only a few times a season. ","['The whole giving position back thing only works if you actually lose the advantage gained. For example, you can‚Äôt just give the position back in a manner that allows you to immediately challenge again, it‚Äôs deemed improper. \n\nThey‚Äôd just get the penalty for gaining an advantage because they haven‚Äôt done anything to give it away again. There might be some merit to the idea of a driver who was overtaken illegally pitting so that they can‚Äôt be given the place back and therefore inciting a penalty, but I doubt there‚Äôd be many if any occasions where pit strategy would be dictated by that.', '> Instead, in a hypothetical situation, let\'s say car A overtakes car B off track and car B immediately pits (immediately not necessity being the next corner but let\'s say within a lap).\n\nThat\'s a penalty for car A then.\n\nThe ""giving up the advantage"" part isn\'t the default, but a concession to not get a penalty in such cases. Depending on the track layout (think of the first chicane in e.g. Saudi Arabia), you might not have many other options than coming out in front of another car.\n\nI don\'t know if it would be enough for race direction if car A slows down considerably as to give up an advantage gained. But if not, it\'s tough luck for car A, that\'s it.', 'It was up to car A to give the position back. They didn‚Äôt do it in time so they just take the penalty and carry on. Doesnt really matter what car B did, there‚Äôs a window to give it back and it closes. Same if a safety car comes out before the position has been given back, now they aren‚Äôt allowed to anyway. Or if another competitor gets in between them because car B made a mistake behind. Car A missed the opportunity to avoid the penalty so they just eat it.', 'I saw an online race where Jimmy Broadbent has a ""let them through"" penalty. He tried pitting to let them through, but the games programming told him no chance. It\'s absolutely worth trying if its untested.', 'To clarify: the car that gained the advantage off-track has to ""give back"" said advantage. If the other car does not want it, that doesn\'t mean that there will be a penalty.\n\nThe perfect example (without starting a flamewar hopefully by just mentioning it), is Abu Dhabi 2021. I\'m referring to the first lap in this case. Verstappen had pole and led into the corner. Hamilton goes off track and ends up ahead. RBR have discussed with the steward that they feel Hamilton should let Max past, but they said he had already given the time that he won back.\n\nWhat happened here is that RBR tried to get Checo directly behind Max so that when Hamilton gave the spot back, Checo would have a chance of also overtaking Hamilton. Max therefore slowed down a little bit. Hamilton meanwhile had also slowed down and given back the advantage in time. That Max is not taking the position back is ultimately not his fault.', ""I'm not sure what exactly you are asking, but a driver just has to serve his penalty if he can't give the position back anymore."", ""What if the car abruptly slows down (due to accident in front) and you are at full racing speed and the brake couldn't make it, you get a penalty too? Heck even if the brakes could make it it's more dangerous to just stop"", '1. Car A overtakes car B illegally. \n\n2. Car B makes a pitstop soon after.\n\n3. Car A gives a position back (therefore the advantage gained) by letting car C through.', ""Which scenario are you referring to\n\nIn my original scenario the car that was overtaken immediately pits and eliminates the other team's ability to give the position back\n\nUnless the offending car immediately pits at the next possible opportunity and then gives up the position (assuming they come out ahead)\n\nBut even if the offending car pits immediately, it could well be the case that they come out way behind because pit stops are really random.\n\nSo a strong defensive measure of the car that was overtaken off track is to immediately pit (especially if they were in the put window anyways). Putting the offending team in a scenario where they only have downsides but no upsides (because offending car coming out WAY ahead post pitstop would either have to give up the massive advantage OR take a 10s penalty... And if they came out way behind then they came out way behind)""]",0,24,0.28,0,23,23,0,0,-0.019999999999999962,0

Lando was just the bigger talent, more experience and more likely that he was ging to be a McLaren world champion.

The more and more I am seeing of Piastri I feel like, even though it‚Äôs still close, he might actually have surpassed Norris. He is just the more complete driver, more stable mentally and is able to deal with Max too. Maybe he is less ‚Äúmarkatble‚Äù than Norris but I feel that is decling too.

But still people underestimate Piastri. I mean another small example is that on Dutch tv guido banter garde had to predict a top 3. He placed Piastri outside of it. Sure he started outside of the top 3, but he has shown he can clearly win a race.

To me, he‚Äôs the greatest ever 7 titles, most wins, and probably the fastest driver of the modern era in terms of pure pace (Singapore 2018 is probably the best qualifying lap ever). 

He has 104 poles, and the only driver with over 100+ wins yet his talent seems brought into question when comparing him to the other greats

I often see people discredit his accolades because he always had the best car which is hypocritical because lando constantly got made fun of for saying the same thing, and for parts of the 2018 season Ferrari had a rocketship but still Vettel cracked under pressure. He went toe to toe with Max (who's also a great) and lost a tightly contested championship on the last lap","['I think a big part of it is that he‚Äôs still racing.

1kfi3v2,A bone to pick with this race director and his unwillingness to use red flags,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kfi3v2/a_bone_to_pick_with_this_race_director_and_his/,2025-05-05, Discussion,"I know red flags have a bit of a negative stigma, as there seems to be a common opinion that it's better to keep the race moving under yellow flags, a VSC or a safety car than to red flag it and bring everyone back to the pits. 

But...why? 

Red flags have become much more common in recent years, presumably for safety reasons. But I've noticed a reversal from this under new race director Rui Marques, who in Saturday's Miami sprint didn't red flag the race after an accident between Liam Lawson and Fernando Alonso that I'm almost sure would have caused a red flag between 2020 and 2024. 

It quickly became obvious that we'd finish the race behind the safety car, losing four potentially thrilling laps of action. 

But again...why? 

We also lost 4 laps to a safety car in Bahrain, and a ridiculous 20 total laps in Australia. That's nearly half the race!

I totally understand the use of the safety car or VSC if there's some debris on track or it appears the incident in question can be dealt with quickly, but I fail to see who benefits from a safety car period of more than a couple of laps. The fans lose out on a bunch of racing laps, and cheap pit stops often give certain drivers lucky advantages at random.

**Benefits of a red flag over a safety car:**  

* Fewer racing laps lost 
* The option for a far more entertaining standing start (but can still do a rolling start which is identical to safety car restart, if desired)
* Oftentimes more fair (no cheap pit stops, and let's not get started on Abu Dhabi 2021)

**Benefits of a safety car over a red flag:**

* Often less of a delay in the action 

But even that last point is flimsy, as I'm as entertained by what's going on during a red flag period as I am watching the cars crawl around the track behind the safety car. 

**53 races/sprints before Marques took over:** 

Safety cars for 4+ laps: 15  
Red flags: 9 

**12 races under Marques:**

Safety cars for 4+ laps: 7  
Red flags: 0

I don't know if this is the result of an edict or what, but I don't think it's a good trend for the sport.
