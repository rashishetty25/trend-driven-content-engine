I listened to the podcast too and was surprised by their assessment. Anyone who thinks Hakkinen was significantly better is placing way too much emphasis on the second half of the season.\n\nWith Hakkinen there was obviously the Nurburgring. Austria is tough to give to Mika as you rightly point out, but given the circumstances of that day with the Stewarts holding up those behind for a good number of laps - unless he was two-stopping (which is highly doubtful) he would’ve been in a very strong position indeed. People forget Hungary where he was ahead of both Williamses early on, again we don’t know the fuel loads but he certainly lost some points there. Monza is another forgotten race where he had a puncture. Before that, he made his stop two laps later than Coulthard but he was in his box for 1.4 seconds longer. Given he had also hit traffic before the stop, it’s possible Mika would’ve been right in the fight for the win.\n\nObviously, Coulthard makes some of that back up with the Canadian GP win being taken away from him. He was also an innocent victim at the first corner in Argentina having qualified well ahead. There were just a good number of early races where Coulthard was better - Melbourne, Imola, Spain, Canada, was ahead in France when Mika retired. Mika improved exponentially from approx Silverstone onwards. His fanbase attributes this to him still recovering from his accident, which seems plausible to me.\n\nEdit: Should’ve also added Coulthard’s lost points at the Nurburgring and possibly Jerez given that win may have been his if Mika had already gotten one. I had already factored these into my conclusion, just forgot to mention them.', 'If I had to do a luck correction for mechanical issues that is biased in favour of Hakkinen (but not so much it’s completely unreasonable), here’s what I would end up with:\n\nHakkinen had failures while leading races in Britain and Austria, lost at least a 3rd place in Hungary, a 3rd in Belgium (lost to a DSQ), and a 4th (instead of 9th) in Italy due to a tyre failure. Hakkinen and Coulthard together also lost a 1-2 in Luxembourg with engine failures. Coulthard lost a probable race win in Canada with a clutch failure while leading. I also reversed the team orders in Jerez, giving the win to Coulthard.\n\nUndoing all the mechanical failures and returning the legitimate race order in Europe, Hakkinen would gain a net 37 points while Coulthard would gain a net 19 points. The revised championship standings would be 55 for Coulthard and 64 for Hakkinen. That’s of course just assuming the best case scenario for Häkkinen in every race (for example it’s a huge extrapolation to say he would’ve definitely won Austria). \n\nAt best you could say Hakkinen had a slight edge, definitely not a clear one. I would tend to agree with you, and say Coulthard had a slight edge.']",7,46,0.82,7,72,72,1,0,0.09999999999999998,1
