1jzint0,The new “Radio Rewind” series on F1’s Youtube channel,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jzint0/the_new_radio_rewind_series_on_f1s_youtube_channel/,2025-04-15, Discussion,"There’s been a noticeable change in F1’s video format on YouTube. In the past couple of years, F1 consistently uploaded “Best Team Radio” and “Top 10 Onboards” for every race weekend. It was a very good format and fans for the most part are enjoying it. However, this year they’ve completely dropped these two series in favor of “Radio Rewind.”

Now, “Radio Rewind” isn’t exactly new — it was typically used for classic races like Malaysia 2012, Canada 2011, Australia 2010, and Hungary 2006. But it seems like they now plan to make one for every race weekend.

Normally, I wouldn’t complain about it. I mean, it’s basically a combination of “Best Team Radio” and “Top 10 (or even more) Onboards” in a single video. However, after the first few races, I have to say I’m not a fan of this new format.

First of all, it only focuses on the race (or the sprint, if there is one), completely leaving out practice sessions and qualifying. That’s a huge shame, because there are often a lot of interesting or funny team radios — or even crashes — that get missed.

Secondly, there’s the issue many fans have pointed out: the lack of subtitles for the team radio. Personally, I find this absurd. Formula 1 team radio has never been known for its clarity, so without subtitles, it’s really hard to understand what’s being said — especially when it comes to technical terms.

I’m not sure why they’ve chosen this direction. Maybe it’s to push out more videos per race weekend, but so far, it seems fans and viewers aren’t happy with it. The comment section under the latest Bahrain GP “Radio Rewind” video was filled with people asking F1 to bring back the old format — separating the onboards and team radio into two separate videos, just like last year.

So what do you think of this new format? Do you like it, or do you also want to go back to the old one?","[""Yeah it's bad. Seems like a cost cutting measure to me.\n\nBut 90% of the comments on those videos are people complaining, so I'm sure they know."", '""maybe it\'s to push out more videos per race weekend"" \n\nbut theyre doing the opposite? 2023 we used to get radio rewind, top 10 onboards and post-race radio of every driver. now it\'s condensed in one video.', 'And the captions were not just for better understanding, they would add fun little effects to it like shaking when driver was shouting, or text bouncing when the car was porpoising', 'I do miss the post-race radio of every driver.', ""I watched one - I don't think I even watched it to the end.

1jzontw,Why Australians should be upset with ‘biased’ F1 broadcast,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jzontw/why_australians_should_be_upset_with_biased_f1/,2025-04-15, News,,"['When Max/Lewis/Seb were dominating, the vocal majoirty was complaining that they cut away from battles to show the winning car. Now they tried to come up with a solution and stills not good. What do people want', 'When you’re too lazy to come up with a ragebait headline so you just outright tell people they should be upset', 'Every F1 fan should be upset at the coverage.', 'Even when Verstappen was winning every race, they always showed him crossing the line (as they should) even if it\'s only for 5 seconds. Don\'t think it has anything to do with bias, but there are some very weird decisions happening with the tv-direction. \n\n\\- They finale are using a mini-box, but aren\'t utilizing it nearly enough or correctly. (And did they stop showing the ""live minibox"" during replays? Why?)  \n\\- They should stop switching to onboards during overtakes, it\'s incredibly annoying. (Use onboards for replays)   \n\\- The timing of replays is so bad, that with races like last weekend we are seeing more actions happening on replays than live.   \n\\- They switch away during an overtake/action, this has happened multiple times every weekend now, with the last examples being Hamilton overtaking Norris, Sainz/Antonelli, etc.   \n\\- Qualifying is incredible close and exciting, but they keep missing A LOT of drivers finishing their lap. If there\'s many drivers that are competitive, we really should not focus on 1 entire lap of a driver. \n\nI know it\'s an incredible hard job, and they also have some very good direction sometimes, but these are some very consistent annoyances that I think a lot of people share. Okay that was my rant, thanks.', ""I'm glad they've stopped cutting away to show an uncontested winner crossing the line. No need to see it when things are happening elsewhere."", 'Oscar was never in doubt of winning that race and tbh I’m fed up of them cutting away from the action to watch someone cross the finishing line.', 'Good luck with that.

That was not my intention.', ""They can't win really. So many times they've cut away from an active battle to show the winner crossing the finish line and people have complained about it."", ""It's been a problem for years that theyve not shown on track action, this time they actually showed on track action rather than a car with no one around him.\n\nThis should be the norm, it absolutely isn't scandalous.
