This is not an exhaustive list and focusses on some races from a bit further back than the last decade. So if your favourite driver isn't represented or I missed something you think is important feel free to add it down below.

# 1956 Italian Grand Prix

Final race of the season.

Title was between three Ferraris', Fangio, Behra and Collins.

Fangio lead the Championship on 30 points, Collins and Behra tied on 22.

Complicating the matter, each driver only counted their best 5 results.

So Fangio could only increase his points tally if he won (giving an extra 2 points), as he didn't compete in the Indy 500 and already discarded a 4th place finish, his next worst result was a 2nd.

Behra could improve his total by finishing better than 3rd, giving him 2 or 4 points meaning he could not beat Fangio to the title.

Collins could improve his points if he finished the race as he already had discarded 2 DNFs, meaning a win would give him the 8 points that would win the title as Fnagio therefore couldn't win.

Fangio's steering broke, so they asked Collins to give his car up... and he did.

Collins gave up his only hope of winning the title so that Fangio would be guaranteed it, no threat from any other team or driver, a straight battle between the 2 of them.

# 1982 San Marino Grand Prix

Ferrari were having a pretty shocking start to the season but arrived at a hime race at Imola with a quick car.

They were running 1-2 with a decent gap as cars behind retired. Villeneuve ahead of Pironi.

Ferrari issued an order to both cars to slow down to protect the cars and the result.

Villeneuve believed this meant for the drivers also to hold station... Pironi did not.

Pironi passed on the last lap and Villeneuve vowed to never talk to him again in his life, he died 2 weeks later making that statement most likely true.

# 1989 San Marino Grand Prix

Second race of the season where McLaren were clearly the fastest car but hadn't won the first race.

Senna qualified on pole with Prost second.

Pre -race agreement between the drivers (not the team apparently), Whoever lead into turn 1 would stay there and be unchallenged for the race.

From the start Senna got away in the lead comfortably, but a major lap 4 crash bought out the red flags meaning a restart was required and the race would be run to aggregate time.

From the second start Prost got ahead comfortably, but into Tosa on Lap 1 senna overtook to lead the race.

Senna claimed the agreement only applied to the first start, Prost was furious.

# 1998 Australian Grand Prix

Season opener and McLaren were looking very quick and the car to beat, qualifying 1-2.

Pre race agreement was whoever lead into turn 1 would win the race to stop the drivers fighting it out.

Hakkinen lead into turn 1 and lead the race as planned.

However a phantom pit call from the team lead Hakkinen to make an extra unnecesary stop, handing the lead to Coulthard and an easy win.

He slowed down on the last lap letting Hakkinen take the victory. Hakkinen went on to become the team leader and win the championship that season.

# 1998 Belgian Grand Prix

Chaotic wet race, through retirements and decent pace the Jordan team find themselves in a 1-2 with Damon Hill ahead of Ralf Schumacher going for the team's first ever win.

Damon Hill (an experienced Grand Prix winner and World Champion) gets on the radio and suggests the team should protect the result and stop the team mates from fighting.

The Team agreed and ordered the drivers to hold station, denying Ralf Schumacher an opportunity at a maiden victory.

Ralf's brother Michael was furious with the decision and was very outspoken against it.

# 2002 Austrian Grand Prix

A dominant Ferrari team with a dominant Schumacher far ahead in the championship having won 4 of the first 5 races (and a third place) and coming off the back of 2 world titles in the previous 2 seasons.

Ferrari find themselves 1-2 with Barrichello ahead of Schumacher.

Ferrari order Barrichello to let Schumacher through for multiple laps approaching the end of the race, but Barrichello appears to be ignoring them and taking a second ever grand prix win.

Out of the last corner he dramatically slows allowing Schumacher to cross the line ahead, Schumacher clearly embarassed amid the boos on the podium ushers Barrichello to take the top step and collect the trophy (which earned the team a fine for breaking podium protocol).

# 2008 Singapore Grand Prix

Possibly the most infamous team orders controversy.

Renault and Alonso found themselves with an uncompetitive car with season best results of 4th place.

In Singapore Alonso qualified 15th and was expecting another tough race.

Alonso took an unusually early pit stop on lap 12 of the race.

The on lap 14 his team mate crashed heavily bringing out the safety car, which due to rules for that season where drivers couldn't pit, promoted Alonso to the front of the field (once penalties for pitting under Sc were sorted out) which he held for the rest of the race.

A year later Piquet claimed he was ordered by the team to crash in a way that gave them a chance at victory, team boss and engineering director were found guilty and given life time bans from F1 (which were later reduced).

# 2010 German Grand Prix

Coming into the race Alonso in Ferrari is a semi-distant 5th palce in the standings 47 points off the lead.

In the race Ferrari team mates Massa and Alonso found themselves at the front with Massa leading.

Through a couple of pit stop phases the gap yoyo'd with Alonso generally looking slightly quicker but unable to pass Massa who looked to have enough to win.

They had effectively seen off the threat of the cars behind and with Team orders being banned in F1 it loooked as though Massa would take a popular and deserved win.

On lap 48 of the race Massa received a message from his engineer Rob Smedley ""OK, so, Fernando is faster than you. Can you confirm you understood that message?"", on lap 49 Massa was 'mysteriously' slow off the exit of the hairpin losing the lead.

His engineer then apologised over the radio and Massa went on to finish 4 seconds behind his team mate.

# 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix

Second race of the season with the Red Bull cars looking quick but not having great success in the opening round of the season.

In a mixed condition race Webber ended up ahead of Vettel on a dry track, after spending much of the race in close quarters and things getting increasingly frought Red Bull issued the command ""Multi Map 21"" to both drivers which was a coded message for car 2 (Webber) to stay in front of car 1 (Vettel).

Ignoring this message and trying to avenge issues from a title deciding race at the end of the previous season Vettel launched risky attacks on his team mate which were rebuffed with equal venom and the multi corner fight by the team mates was intense, Vettel came out ahead.

Team Boss Christian Horner came on the radio saying ""This is silly, Seb. Come on."" on lap 46.

On lap 47 Webber tried to repass Vettel, but was forced wide and blocked from overtaking.

Vettel went on to win the race and faced fierce criticism from Webber in the media after the race but Vettel was unapologetic and supported by the team.","[""Good read! We can't talk team orders and not mention the 1982 French GP. Arnoux and Prost got a 1-2 but Arnoux (starting on pole) ignored a pre-race agreement that if he was running ahead of Prost, he'd let him pass to help Prost's championship challenge. I guess the appeal of winning his home race was too strong to resist. Arnoux also left Renault at the end of the season.\xa0\n\nAlso a fun fact about this race, it was a French 1-2-3-4 (Arnoux and Prost 1-2 for Renault followed by Pironi and Tambay 3-4 for Ferrari)\xa0"", '>Fangio\'s steering broke, so they asked Collins to give his car up... and he did.\n\n>Collins gave up his only hope of winning the title so that Fangio would be guaranteed it, no threat from any other team or driver, a straight battle between the 2 of them.\n\nThat\'s not exactly how it went.\n\nFerrari asked Musso to give Fangio his car, he disobeyed, Collins came in for a scheduled pit and when he saw Fangio standing there he gave up his car for the maestro, effectively handing over the championship to Fangio, because ""he was young and would have more opportunities"" (Collins died two years later during the German GP).\n\n\nSo there was a team order, but what happened was one of the most gentlemanlike acts in the history of Formula 1.\n\nFangio later said he was moved by the chivalry of his colleague.', 'Some interesting context about Austria 2002 and Ferrari team orders in general from Ross Brawn \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/UVrlK', ""I'll never forget how Schumacher made it as obvious as possible that Rubens won that and earned that win."", 'The incident that’s most comparable to yesterday is Melbourne 1998. The problem isn’t so much these things being righted on track later on, but then it becomes a case of where the line is and what has to go wrong for a driver before he starts calling for his teammate to let him past again.\n\nI think given the specific sequence of events that led to Norris falling behind in the first place, there was enough to justify the order, but the practice of team orders to swap places anytime a driver suffers a bad pit stop and drops behind his teammate isn’t something that should become a precedent. There was a context to this incident that made it justifiable, but you don’t want teams to start taking it to the extreme and start “fixing” the race order if for example a safety car swaps two drivers around, or giving a teammate back a place he’s lost because of a penalty the team thinks is unfair.\n\nIf there hadn’t been the discussion around letting Oscar have dibs on the pit stop before hand, I’d be a lot less in favour of it.', ""Something which I think always gets missed when discussing Austria 2002 is that Ferrari had team-ordered Rubens out of the way at the previous year's Austrian GP in order to allow Schumacher to take second. That one didn't go down brilliantly, but it was at least somewhat understood since Schumacher's main rival that year (Coulthard) won the race, and would have closed to just two points behind Schumacher if not for the swap. The fact it wasn't for the win also helped soften the blow somewhat.\n\nThe 2001 race was fresh in everyone's minds the following year though, so the fact Ferrari did it again in a season which they were utterly dominating was always going to cause anger.

Scenario 2) Lando pits first, Oscar pits second, Oscar gets the slow stop. Was it an operator issue, or was it a gun issue. If a gun issue then stop 2 would've been slower i.e. Oscar's stop.  
Probable result: Lando P2, Oscar P4 behind Leclerc and Lando after the stops or \~8 seconds behind Lando (would've been close).

Scenario 3) Oscar pits first, Lando pits second, both pit stops go as expected.  
Probable Result: Lando P2, Oscar P3. Lando does an extra lap, Oscar gets a 1 lap undercut on Lando. Oscar \~3 seconds behind Lando after the stops.

Secnario 4) Oscar pits first, Lando pits second, Lando gets the slow stop.

Oscar is < 1 second behind Lando after letting him by.

Lando and Oscar did the right thing by the team. Which consists of hundreds of people at the fatcory not just themselves. Including the poor wheel gunner who either had bad equipment or a bad day at the office, we don't know.

Oscar ended up closer to Lando in this scenario than any other. And it is possible that Oscar would've finished behind Leclerc if the stops were the other way around.
