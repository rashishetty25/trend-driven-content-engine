This is designed to show when the drivers have had good runs of form and also dips in there results. The first 4 races are just an average of all the races up until that point as a 5 race average is not possible. e.g. the ""average"" for Australia is just the race results for that race as there was no previous races. This graph also does not take sprint races into account and only the drivers' Grand Prix finishing position.

Lando in the dark orange had a very good start to the season winning the opening round. His average tailed off slightly losing the lead for the champion to Oscar after the Saudi Arabian GP. His results then stayed around the same until Spain where they dropped off heavily after a DNF in Canada. His average was then down after that race as even though he was getting podiums, the DNF skewed his average. This is then compounded by the DNF in the Dutch GP after which he hasn't got a win since.

Oscar didn't have a great start to the season finishing P9 in Australia but his performances picked up and as he won the next race in China, After which he only finished off the podium once up until Azerbaijan where he DNFed and has not got on the podium since which as brought down his average significantly.

Max had a good start to the season but his average finish was slowly declining until is dramatically dropped off after he was taken out by Kimi Antonelli on the first lap in Austria.

McLaren | 678

I haven't seen this discussed anywhere, as I think most people are focused on the WDC fight, but the fight for 2nd in WCC will likely affect the results of the WDC.

Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull have been constantly improving the car as they fight for second, while McLaren have not had any upgrades since Monza. This could result in McLaren falling back even further as their performance is caught up by the other 3. It's possible that by Abu Dhabi that the McLaren are the 3rd or 4th fastest car, meaning the challenge by Verstappen could be a lot easier as Ferrari and Mercedes start getting podiums.","['That‚Äôs an interesting perspective.

Let‚Äôs assume we have VER 1st, NOR 2nd and PIA 3rd in the next 4 races. Also, in the sprints we assume that Oscar goes 2nd and 4th, Lando 1st and 3rd, and Max 2nd and 4th.
