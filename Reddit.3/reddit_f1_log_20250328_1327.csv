Someone else has already taken the fall so even if Tsunoda comes in and generates the worst outcomes like crashing the car every outing, we won’t put it on him as we know:

a) the car is problematic. 
b) He has had a good season start in another car. 
c) another driver has failed in it. 
d) It’ll be awful PR for Redbull to shop for another driver, they’ll have to give him time. 
e.) even if they wanted to shop for a new driver, they’re out of options as far as car development experience goes unless they want to extend an invitation to Daniel Riccardio (very unlikely i think he is done with F1) 

In summary, there’s no performance level that he can exhibit from here on out that threatens his seat till the end of this season at least.

2.	⁠He has nothing to lose, his contract with Racing Bulls runs out this year with no clear potential to join any other team on the current grid.

I wanted Yuki for the Redbull job from the onset instead of Lawson, but i think i prefer how it has played out. I think it provides a stable future for Yuki.

Charles should have listened to those words of wisdom.', '(By Par Alexandre)\n\nScuderia Ferrari, struggling at the start of the season, suffered a particularly dramatic setback at the Chinese Grand Prix. After finishing in 5th place, Charles Leclerc was disqualified from the final standings due to a weight problem, a costly penalty for Ferrari in the championship race. But while the official reason was linked to a lack of weight under the regulation 800 kg, a new revelation from Fred Vasseur, Ferrari\'s main team, brings to light an additional and rather unusual cause for this disqualification.\n\nLeclerc had done everything right during the race, but once on the scales, Ferrari\'s SF-25 turned out to be slightly under the minimum required weight of 799.4 kg, after removing the two liters of fuel needed for post-race analysis. This missing kilo was enough to disqualify the Monegasque driver. At first glance, this might appear to be a purely mechanical infringement, but it seems there was more to it than that.\n\nRemember the exchange between Leclerc and his race engineer at the Australian Grand Prix? It should already have aroused suspicion: ""Is there a leakage? ... I have a full seat of water, like, full of water!"" What appeared to be an amusing exchange at the time of the race turned out to be the same reason why the single-seater lost weight at the Chinese Grand Prix. Indeed, according to Fred Vasseur, it wasn\'t just tire wear that contributed to the disqualification, but also the loss of a liter of water due to a failure in Charles Leclerc\'s drink supply.\n\n**In an interview with L\'Équipe newspaper, Fred Vasseur revealed that the situation was far more complex than a simple question of worn tires: ""Charles Leclerc\'s downgrading on Sunday is similar to what happened to Russell last year in Belgium,"" he explained. ""The tires are only part of the explanation... We also lost a liter of water when Charles\' drink supply leaked. Downgrading for weight is always an addition of small factors.""**\n\nFerrari being the limit of all parameters at the Chinese Grand Prix, it was this missing liter of water that played a key role in Leclerc\'s disqualification. A cause which might seem anecdotal, but which, combined with tire wear, cost Ferrari dearly. Frédéric Vasseur adds: ""The aim of the game in F1 is to get to the limit of all parameters, everywhere. To get to the last gram of weight, to get to the last tenth of a millimetre of skid, to get to the last millimetre of aileron deformation"". Let\'s hope that this water leak will be definitively repaired for the Japanese Grand Prix.', 'TL;DR: Must be the water.', 'Gotta say, lads\n\nI called it: https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/s/r2hB5SK7Ha', 'Must be the water.', ""Leclerc really is Raikkonen's successor.

In terms of pure numbers, the 18-year-old hadn\'t really delivered a particularly outstanding performance. The Italian started in eighth place, and he crossed the finish line in eighth place as well. He was 53.7 seconds behind winner Piastri and 42.6 seconds behind George Russell in the sister car.\n\n> The disqualification of the two Ferraris subsequently pushed the youngster up to sixth place. After the race, the youngster revealed that he had sustained damage to the underbody somewhere, which was affecting his pace. Given this, the Silver Arrows driver\'s performance naturally had to be reassessed. The only question that remained was how and where the underbody was damaged.\n\n> After a detailed analysis of the TV images and an examination of the car, chief engineer Andrew Shovlin provided the solution a few days late: ""Leclerc had hit Lewis\'s right rear wheel. The end plate of his front wing broke off. Kimi saw this, but unfortunately he couldn\'t avoid it because other cars were next to him. He drove over the debris, which flew under the car and damaged the deflectors at the entrance to the underbody.""\n\n> Damage costs two to three tenths.\nThis sensitive area of \u200b\u200bthe car has a significant impact on aerodynamics and, consequently, performance. However, the loss of downforce was difficult to quantify, Shovlin regrets: ""It definitely cost a lot of performance. It would be easier to calculate how much it affected the lap time if we had already completed a few laps. But here it happened on the very first lap, so we can only estimate it. Based on the aerodynamic data, we estimate that the loss of downforce cost two to three tenths per lap.""\n\n> Another problem was that the damage affected only one side of the car. The loss of downforce was particularly noticeable on the rear axle. ""Kimi quickly got on the radio and complained that he had no grip at the rear. As a result, the tires started to slide, they overheated, and lost grip. He struggled with this problem for most of the race. During the pit stop, we were only able to alleviate it slightly with the front wing,"" said Shovlin.\n\n> There\'s more to come from Kimi. \nIn the end, the driver had to somehow deal with it himself: ""When you have that kind of damage to your car, it can result in inconsistent handling. Depending on the corner or wind direction, it\'s sometimes better or worse. The balance shifts in different directions. He really did a good job there. But of course, it was a bit frustrating when you saw his strong pace at the beginning of the weekend. He was battling with the two Ferraris and with Max.""\n\n> Overall, Shovlin gives his young protégé a glowing review for his start with the factory team: ""He\'s a brilliant fit for our team. It was quite difficult to succeed a driver as successful as Lewis. Everyone here in the team enjoys working with Kimi. And he\'s just having fun. Melbourne was particularly difficult with the rain in the first race. But he adapted well. I think there\'s a lot more to come from Kimi.""', 'So glad to let him play with puzzles.

Yuki might’ve got handed a better hand now than if he had been the original choice for the seat.', 'Next article: 13 reasons Tsunoda will not fail at Red Bull', 'Checo set such low standards at RB, only getting last place in almost every race/qualy could have been worse, which is what Liam did.  So if Yuki can probably do something at least between what Checo and Liam was doing, then he at least would buy himself some time to further improve.', 'If Red Bull has any brain left they will be happy with Tsunoda finishing close to the points or sometimes in the points. If he beats that, fine. Awesome. But I think that they are in a problematic spot with their car philosophy for a long time now. Where only the Alien Verstappen can drive around a lot of those problems. Maybe also a couple of other top tier drivers in the sport. And even with that in mind it was the right choice to demote Lawson to a car that seems good to drive. I think Lawson will be disappointed for the moment but if Red Bull sticks to their words of developing him there, he will have a good time at Toro Rosso.

1jltjjr,Yuki isn’t being promoted for being faster but to develop the car,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jltjjr/yuki_isnt_being_promoted_for_being_faster_but_to/,2025-03-28, Discussion,"Discussion about his promotion keeps being about him being faster than Liam in the RB21, but reading between the lines of statements made I believe that isn’t the main reason. Liam has only had 13 races, and driven 3 different cars. Yuki has done around 50 races, driven all VCARBs of this regulation era and last years RB. 

If RB want any chance of fighting for the WDC with Max, they need 2 drivers capable of steering the development, and we know Max’ feedback is a dangerous path to follow.","[""Yuki is closer to 100 I think, he's very experienced now so hopefully can help develop it. Why they ever thought Liam would be a viable option after 11 races will never be understood."", ""I mean they didn't follow on any of Perez' feedback, so the certainly aren't going to follow Tsunoda's. Pretty sure that was just PR to try and give reasons for justifying the swap anyway."", ""if they wanted the faster driver, they would've promoted yuki in the first place. like he said himself, it's politics."", 'Whatever, All I want is for yuki to get a shot at saving his F1 career. Chances maybe low, but they are never zero.', ""New reg next year, right? Not much time left to develop anything. Minor improvements here and there from now on and they are going to make upgrades to suit Max, not Yuki. \n\nYuki's promotion is about managing damage from now on. They are betting that Yuki won't finish in bottom 3 like Lawson and score few points here and there. It's not about developing the car imo"", ""Max has been complaining about the car/reporting issues and feedback since mid 2023 and they didn't take it seriously because Max kept winning. Checo has also been complaining but they didn't take it seriously because Max kept winning. Liam got promoted and suddenly after two races Red Bull seem to realise they have problems with the car. Too little too late imo. I truly think something is happening behind the scenes. Maybe Max has hinted at leaving the team if they continue like this and Red Bull is in panic mode because they've been relying on Max too much and now know that his loyalty isn't endless."", 'That was a nonsense statement to be fair. It has nothing to do with development. If that was the case they would have chose him over Liam initially. Theres new regs coming in next year with virtually no time to develop anything and if Max giving all his feedback isn’t enough, I highly doubt Yuki is going to add much more. \n\nThey got offered a fat paycheck by Honda to have Yuki in the car for the Japanese race, simple. No solid information on how much but it’s in the tens of millions.', 'Thanks for letting us know.', 'It’s obvious that’s what they’re after. Horner said as much about Yuki’s experience being vital to helping them develop the car. They can’t listen to Max on his own anymore.
