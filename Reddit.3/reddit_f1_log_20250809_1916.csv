Can I draw it and explain it to you in a computer? Because here just speaking about it obviously I’m not going to go into detail but it’s completely different,” he told media including Motorsport Week.\n\n“The way you use the gears, the downshift and how it goes into engine braking, the transition from the brake migration to the engine braking is different. You have to change your driving style for sure.”\n\n# Sainz optimistic results will reflect pace soon\n\nThis season has been one of many ups and downs for Sainz so far, the four-time Grand Prix winner being undermined by various problems on his side of the garage.\n\nYet he added that despite the adaptation period, he feels that he has made good progress.\n\n“For me, it’s important that even if I’m taking my time to adapt to the team and the car… I don’t think I took my time to adapt to the car, I think I was quite quick straight away – it’s just getting results and putting things together that has been a struggle since the beginning of the year,” the 30-year-old said.\n\n“Still in Race 12, it doesn’t seem like we’re getting any better at putting things together, but it will come at some point.\n\n“In the meantime, I’ll just keep my head down and I’m pretty sure the result is about to come.”\n\nWilliams Team Principal James Vowles has described the situation as a “shared frustration” over missed opportunities and inconsistent results in Sainz’s debut season with the team.\n\nHe added: “He’s incredibly quick, as you can see, when everything runs smoothly. We’re just not able to get it smooth.”\n\nSainz’s best results this season have been two eighth-place finishes, in Jeddah and Imola, but he still trails team-mate Alex Albon by 38 points in the standings.', ""If the Ferrari needs lots of engine braking to turn the car, I wonder if that means it doesn't pivot that well without the rears unloading during braking.

1mlnh3q,"Now it’s summer break, how do you think Helmut Marko’s rookie report card panned out?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1mlnh3q/now_its_summer_break_how_do_you_think_helmut/,2025-08-09, Discussion,"Ahead of Australia, Helmut Marko offered his assessment of the 5 rookies who begun the season to Servus TV.

As a reminder, he rated them as follows:

Kimi Antonelli: “He is clearly an elite driver, although he is under enormous pressure. His performance is impressive: he has already driven around 10,000 test kilometres, but he has also had two serious accidents. You can feel the pressure on him. And, of course, Toto Wolff wants to repeat the Verstappen story at Mercedes. However, going straight to an elite team will be a challenge for him. But in terms of potential, he is certainly a top driver.”

Oliver Bearman: “He is a very fast driver, although he had a lot of accidents in Formula 2 and Formula 3 because he takes big risks. He goes to the limit. Maybe he won’t get to the top as fast as Antonelli, but he’s definitely a standout.”

Isack Hadjar: “Hadjar lost the championship by only four or five points [sic]. Our data analysts calculated that he lost about 80 points due to technical failures and other problems. So he is very fast. I would say that if he continues to develop well and learn to control his emotions, he has A-level potential as well.”

Gabriel Bortoleto: “I would classify him as a ‘B’ driver. He’s a very intelligent driver: he won the Formula 3 championship, but with only one win and he usually stays out of trouble. In Formula 2 he only managed two victories. He is a driver who brings the car home safely, has a good command of strategy and tyre management, but I don’t see that pure speed in him.”

Jack Doohan: “He is a ‘C’. I don’t think he will complete the season.”

Obviously he was right about Doohan not completing the season, but what do you think of his assessments of the other rookies? They’re fairly detailed, which is why I think they warrant a bit of discussion now we’ve seen races from them all.

If they paved it, they had to remove the asphalt after every Grand Prix to make it useable for the horses again.

He's not the same as 20 years ago, but he's still better than midfield drivers. I'd say he's similar to Lewis now, they are at the end of their career, a bit slower than the top guys, but they are consistent and still better than 80% of the grid. Put Alonso or Lewis to any midfield team and I'm 100% sure they will score more points than their teammate"", ""It'll be interesting to see where they'll be next year, with Neweys designs and all."", 'Of all the teams to do this with Aston is not one imo. Alonso is still a top ten on the grid at least.\xa0\n\nSauber and particularly Racing Bulls are much bigger cases of this.\xa0', ""Stroll's not as bad as people make him out to be."", ""Alonso has out qualified stroll 26 times in a row. In that time the record for different drivers against stroll are\n\n0-26 Alonso\n\n1-25 Norris, Piastri, Russell\n\n2-24 Leclerc, Verstappen\n\n5-21 Albon\n\n6-20 Sainz, Hamilton\n\nYou could argue most of these drivers have had a way better car than alonso in the past 26 races. So what were you saying again? Looks like no one else would've done better than alonso""]",0,107,0.3,0,97,97,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
