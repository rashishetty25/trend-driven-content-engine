If you saw someone go to kick a dog but miss, they still intended to kick the dog.. the intention was still there. I like Max a hell of a lot more than I used to because his racecraft has completely won me over, he is just absolutely fascinating to watch.\n\nBut these things just can't be allowed, and people making excuses for it out of being a fan or out of whatever reason you have for making excuses are just idiotic and hypocritical.\n\nCan you imagine the reaction if Stroll did that? Just once, let alone multiple times in his professional career. People would be calling for his head. This whole 'its max what do you expect', 'he's hot headed', 'gamer moment', shit is funny to say sure.. but in reality of the sporting regulations, its not what anyone that is a fan of 'racing', wants to see.\n\nAnd minimal contact should never be used as an excuse in a day and age where the cars are so fragile that many times we've seen minimal contact put an end to someone's race or lead to a flagging intervention that's changed the outcome of several positions in a race."", 'People also keep saying ""He\'s matured as a driver"" over the past few years.\n\nNo, he hasn\'t.

1l330lk,Why haven't we heard a peep out of the media regarding Franko Colapinto vs Jack Doohan,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l330lk/why_havent_we_heard_a_peep_out_of_the_media/,2025-06-04, Discussion,"Edit for name spelling can't change title on phone sorry* Just as the title says, Franco was bought in on a 5 race deal and theu made it sound like he was going to out race Jack, it is now clear the Alpine is a tractor with Jack having managed to get closer to points than Franco. What irritates me is when Jack was struggling all we heard about was how he is going to lose his seat the poor fella must of had pressure from everywhere, but now Franco is struggling and there doesn't seem to be anywhere near the pressure. Why is that? The media doesn't seem to even want to talk about him or even interview him. I saw at least 10 interviews with Jack before he stood down asking him the worst questions, and some of them were very rude. Why the different treatment?","['as an aussie it was pretty rough watching the treament of doohan. everything with him was a comparison to his dad (way more than they ever have with sainz/sainz)and then basic ""how did pace feel today?""\n\nthe narrative the whole time was essentially he wasnt good enough and waiting him out til he was replaced, which seemed to be a plan regardless of how he did', ""Same reason we don't hear about Lawson vs Tsunoda. The swap changed nothing really so media lost interest"", 'Because it was 90% Franco’s batshit fan base that raved about Doohan 24/7, and now ofc he’s not performing like they expected they’re all quiet', 'Because it doesn\'t really matter, in all honesty. Briatore has a personality so abrasive he could sand furniture so you wouldn\'t get a decent answer out of him, Oakes isn\'t there anymore and it\'s daft to ask Franco ""do you think you\'re doing a better job than Jack?""\n\nIt\'s done, Alpine is a mess, the move didn\'t make sense, we move on.', 'Because the ""5 race contract"" isn\'t an actual thing and was most probably invented by the Alpine PR department. The Doohan Drama was all about if and when he is getting replaced by Colapinto. Now Colapinto is there and even though his initial performances weren\'t that good, there is also no immediate threat for him. Nobody is waiting in line right now, so there is not much drama to report on.', 'I’d argue that the Alpine isn’t a tractor, it has shown some really good pace especially in Bahrain so the pace is there. The issue is that Gasly has been the only one to come even close to extracting it. Colapinto seems to be pretty similar to Doohan in terms of pace which makes it looks like the millions Alpine spent to buy him out of the contract was pointless given they could have just kept Doohan in. \n\nHaving said that, Alpine are last in the constructors and the only way they improve on that is by giving Colapinto or Doohan some bloody stability. Time in the car is scarce and precious and you need to become an expert in how it handles to be able to extract the lap time and be able to give solid feedback regarding the set up. Just look at how Sainz and Hamilton aren’t fully up to speed yet despite how good they are. \n\nAs for the media, there are far more interesting stories on the grid and this one is just a B Tech version of the Tsunoda at Red Bull story.', 'Similar situation to Liam vs Yuki I guess - everyone’s realised the car is garbage and have lowered their expectations accordingly.', ""Probably just that the media is likely going to report on rumours that are backed up by reliable sources and there's no rumours that I'm aware of surrounding Colapinto at the moment. I'm sure if rumours start the reporting on them will start."", 'The assumption was that Doohan would get replaced by Colapinto because he shows more potential and he has more advertising backing him. There’s less risk of him getting replaced because of that. FWIW, these questions are being asked. Briatore was just asked in Spain if Schumacher would replace Colapinto this season.

Rough start but that's how it goes in a shuffle. Great end pace and was going to pass Charles with how quickly he was approaching. That Merc is a weird car.
