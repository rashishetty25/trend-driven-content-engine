---

In the past days we received a lot of requests for special flairs celebrating Hulkenberg's podium.

So in order to properly commemorate this historic event we decided to create a limited edition flair, featuring a limited edition emoji made by u/Blanchimont.

This flair can only be claimed in the next 27 hours. So if you want to have proof so that you can brag to all the future members of the community that you were here when history was made, this is your chance. If you change your flair back after the 27 hours you will not be able to recover the limited edition flair.

To claim this flair all you have to do is to send a comment under this post including the words ""Hulkenpodium"" or ""Hulkengoat"" (and pray that AutoModerator doesn't crash and burn)

Edit: It can take a bit of time for Automod to get to you, so please don't spam if it doesn't update immediately. Right now there seems to be a processing delay of \~4 minutes

Questions about how long he wants to stay in the sport, questions about how close retirement might be.\n\nSo this is what’s confusing me. Given the complete collapse in performance and loss of key players like Newey, as well as the clear rising tensions around and expressed through Horner, him leaving is not a huge shock. Particularly with the allegations of last year, in addition to the drama between the Thai contingency and the Austrian contingency of ownership.\n\nBut why the sudden midyear firing? \n\nIf Max’s camp made Horner’s firing a requirement for Max to stay, that seems like a big gamble considering Max is likely out in a couple of years. Just because he doesn’t want to do this anymore. Whereas Horner isn’t just the team principal, he’s the CEO. Or was rather. He built that team from the ground up, although I can understand there are reasonable arguments here that he also then drove it right back into the ground. But still, it seems like an odd move to keep Max, when Horner had a contract through 2030 and Max is definitely not a lifer like Alonso or Hamilton.\n\nAnd if Max is leaving Definitely for Mercedes, and that’s the reason why Horner was fired… again, I could understand it, but why do it midseason?\n\nOf course, logic doesn’t usually govern corporate politics, so maybe this is a matter of certain parties using potential Max departures as a reason to finally push him out.\n\nBut still, that would be more understandable if this wasn’t happening in the middle of a season.\n\nThat’s what I’m trying to understand here.\n\nI know with the new car regulations looming, the sooner you get the right people in the right seats the better. But this is just a wild change with legacy leadership.\n\nAnd if it does have to do with Max, that is a fascinating move to make for someone who likely would’ve retired before the conclusion of Horner’s contract.\n\nMaybe I’m looking at this wrong, and I’m happy for someone to correct me. But I just cannot get my brain around this. If it were at the end of the season, or close to the end of the season, all of these theories would make sense.\n\nWould be curious what others think.']",3877,259,0.99,3877,247,247,658,25,0.0,658

(Twelve because that's what the newest rookies have done so far.)

**Sprints are not included.**

**Race Head-to-Head:** Only includes races where both drivers finished. If a driver completed enough of the race to be classified but retired due to a crash or mechanical issue, that is treated as a DNF.

**Qualifying Head-to-Head:** Only includes qualifying sessions in which both drivers set a valid qualifying time. If a driver didn’t participate in qualifying at all, didn’t set a time, or their time was dropped for a violation of the technical regulations, that weekend wasn’t included and is listed as a DNQ in the table.

**Qualifying Time Differential:** Uses the time from the last qualifying session in which both drivers participated. For example, if one driver made it to Q2 and the other was knocked out in Q1, the Q1 time is used for both.

**Use of Average (Mean) for Qualifying Gap to Teammate:** Because the chart for qualifying gaps uses an average, some drivers were helped or hurt by a single bad qualifying session. The two most extreme examples in each direction are:

* Oscar Piastri crashed during Q3 of the 2023 Canadian GP due to weather, which meant that his lap for that session was 3.303 seconds slower than Lando Norris. If that qualifying session was dropped, he would only be 0.174 slower than Norris instead of 0.434.
*  Pierre Gasly’s teammate Brendon Hartley set a time that was 12.858 seconds slower during Q1 of the 2018 Azerbaijan GP. Without that qualifying session, Gasly would actually be 0.114 seconds slower than his teammates instead of 1.183 faster.","['Going a bit unnoticed, but Gabi is doing a great job, especially on qualis', '10 DNFs in Alonso’s first 12 race weekends lol\n\nI know it’s DNF by either drivers but that was just funny to see.', 'The key caveat is their teammates are not all equal, which makes comparisons hard.\n\nGeorge Russell’s rookie season 12-0 quali and 10-2 race H2H looks amazing, but his teammate was Robert Kubica returning after 8 years, and the Williams car that season was terrible.

1lvbg6m,Safety Car Restart Procedure,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lvbg6m/safety_car_restart_procedure/,2025-07-09, Discussion,"The SC restart procedure has always been a bugbear of mine. I feel there are so many better ways to do it that don't involve slowing down significantly to allow the SC to 'escape' - possibly losing tyre temps and just causing general havoc.

Surely there are better ways to restart?

Option 1 - Send the SC into the pit a lap early - at which point, all vehicles are under a Virtual Safety Car. Paint a new line towards the end of the lap, at which point the VSC ends - and the front driver is now the SC and can restart at any point as they do now, with no overtaking until the SC line. They no longer need to completely slow down to allow the SC to 'escape' to a safe distance. Problem with this approach is that at times it may add an extra lap. (Maybe not VSC - maybe speed limited is the better wording)

Option 2 - Move the SC line further into the track rather than at the pit lane exit - meaning the SC exits the track, and there is sufficient distance for the Pole sitter to restart without again having to slow down so much and create an artifical gap.

Probably many other ways to do it.","[""I think better communication would be enough. The problem at Silverstone was:\n\n* The call for the SC to come in was made late.\n* The teams didn't have any advanced knowledge the SC was going to be in that lap - the first the drivers knew was the lights going off.\n* Because they choose to bring the SC late they turned the lights off at a high speed part of the circuit, only Oscar could see the lights had gone out. Max didn't expect Oscar to slow to restart speeds (because he was unaware the SC was coming in).\n\nHad race control put the SC in notice out in the complex or - at worst- maggots and Becketts there would have been no issues. The SC would have had more time to escape, Oscar wouldn't have had to slow down to such a low speed to build a gap."", ""Option 1. The point of the VSC is that cars are to maintain the time gaps. This is obviously impossible at the end of the SC period when everyone is bunched together. The problem is track layout dependent. Any track with a substantial front straight tends to benefit the cars following the leader if the front car doesn't game the situation somewhat. You'd end up with the situation that many race leaders going into a SC lose their lead when SC ends and this is what the SC shouldn't really do.\n\nOption 2 is just confusing."", ""> Problem with this approach is that at times it may add an extra lap.\n\nIt may? Mate, SC gets called in once it's safe to bring it in. Once that's happened, it'll almost always be safe to restart as well. You'd be delaying things by a lap in almost all cases of this.\n\n> meaning the SC exits the track, and there is sufficient distance for the Pole sitter to restart without again having to slow down so much and create an artifical gap. \n\nAlso, this frankly hasn't been a valid concern since they disallowed overtaking before the start finish line. Before that, you need to create a gap to ensure cars wouldn't be racing past a safety car that's still out on track. Nowadays, creating gaps and whatnot is purely done for gamesmanship.\n\nIf that bites someone in the ass, it's genuinely their own fault."", 'I like your options but I disagree that it solves the fundamental issue.\n\nThe problem is not that the SC has to “escape” because they really don’t have to. Under the current rules, once the SC light goes out the leader becomes the SC, so he can theoretically be chasing down the SC, so long he doesn’t overtake SC. \n\nThe problem is that the leader “feels the need” to get as much advantage as they can at restart, which means gaming the car(s) behind. I believe this is the thing to solve. At the moment, the way to do this (consistently) is to slow down and start at your own pace.\n\nThe problem this race is a combination of 2 things: safety car coming in message late (meaning leader cannot anticipate the SC light going out), plus Oscar continue accelerating and then slow down so abruptly AFTER SC lights go out. He could have coasted or follow SC closely, but that will diminish the advantage he could gain at restart.\n\nTLDR: there is no rule demanding the leader to “slow to restart speed” or let the SC escape. They do that to game the cars behind. That’s the real problem to solve.', ""I don't get all the fuss about the safety car procedure just because Piastri did some dumb shit.\n\nThe safety car turned off the lights at the start of sector 3 as it is normal.\n\nPiastri doesn't have to restart into the first corner of sector 3. He doesn't need such a big gap. Usually at Silverstone restarts were done into vale or even as late as the exit onto the straight, not before stow.\n\nBut an easy solution would be: don't allow high speeds before safety car line 1.\n\nPS: safety car lines have multiple purposes. You can't just move them."", 'The SC doesn’t need to escape.

So I decided to go through each track this morning and who I thought would be most likely to win each race.

This is what I came up with,

Australia - Verstappen - tight with Norris. Albon and Alonso.

China - Russell - Prime Hamilton might win here, but Russell is quite underrated in China imo.

Japan - Verstappen - And it's not even close. 

Bahrain - Leclerc - He is spectacular in Bahrain. Shoutout to Gasly too.

Saudi Arabia - Piastri - This was a really hard one. Verstappen, Piastri, Leclerc and even Russell are all very good here. Piastri just beats Leclerc for me.

Miami - Verstappen - Very hard one to pick. Nobody seems to have always been clean in Miami. 

Imola - Verstappen - Verstappen has basically dropped a 10/10 performance every race he's driven in Imola. 

Monaco - Leclerc has been unlucky in the past  but is rapid around his streets. Shoutout to Ocon.

Spain - Verstappen did have a mad moment this year but it's not for a lack of pace. Prime Lewis might beat him but he was underwhelming this year so Max takes it.

Canada - Verstappen - Russell is good in Montreal, but this is a battle between he three world champions on the grid. Verstappen, Hamilton and Alonso. I'll give Max the edge because he's in his prime and he does not beat his team mates here, he destroys them.

Austria - Verstappen - I really wanted to give this one to Lando but Max's record here is incredible.

Britain - Hamilton - Verstappen and Norris are really good in Silverstone, but I have to pick Hamilton. 

Belgium - Verstappen - He seems to be driving on easy mode every time we come to Spa. Hamilton and Piastri are both very good here too.

Hungary - Hamilton - Lewis has been great here every race since 2017. Verstappen is very good too.

Netherlands - Verstappen - He's won here in 2021-2023 and then got a strong 2nd in 2024. Gasly is also very very good around Zandvoort. Lando and Fernando too.

Italy - Leclerc - Hamilton, Sainz, Leclerc, Russell. A good few very good drivers around Monza. I narrowed it down to Leclerc vs Hamilton. I guess we'll find out who's better this year. I'll go Leclerc (Shoutout to Ricciardo when he was in F1)

Azerbaijan - Leclerc - Perez not being on the grid makes this an easier choice. Leclerc is fabulous around Baku, especially in qualifying.

Singapore - Norris - Lando is fantastic around Singapore and every year he has raced in Singapore he's maximised his performance. 

USA - Verstappen has been incredible here ever since his rookie season. Norris and Hamilton (bar last year) are very good too.

Mexico - Verstappen - Another one of Max's great tracks. In fact Max has won by 12-20 seconds 5 seperate times in Mexico. (Shoutout to Ricciardo again when he was in F1, he was great around here)

Brazil - Verstappen - This is an interesting one. Hamilton used to be great here but he hasn't had a good race in Brazil since 2021. Verstappen is great in Interlagos, Russell is very good too, as are Norris and Sainz. 

Las Vegas - Leclerc - We've only had two races in Vegas so it's hard to choose. Gasly is great in Quali but had terrible race pace in 2023. I'll go with Leclerc as the best overall. His performance in 2023 was fabulous and he was still alright in 2024. 

Qatar - Verstappen - Verstappen and Russell are great around this circuit . Shoutout to Gasly again. Max just pips George for me courtesy of his race here last season.

Abu Dhabi - Verstappen - Leclerc, Hamilton, Verstappen, Sainz, Norris and even Tsunoda Quite a few drivers tend to impress in the final race of the year. Peak Hamilton might win here but as for right now it's between Verstappen and Norris. Max had an incident last year but it wasn't for lack of pace. He also won 4 races in a row from 2020-2023.
