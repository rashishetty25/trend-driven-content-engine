1n5trk2,My Experience with Disabilities at the Dutch Grand Prix ‚Äì Accessibility in F1 Needs Serious Attention,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1n5trk2/my_experience_with_disabilities_at_the_dutch/,2025-09-01, Discussion,"Hi all,
I wanted to share my experience attending the 2025 Dutch Grand Prix as someone living with Crohn‚Äôs disease and rheumatoid arthritis, in the hope it raises awareness around how inaccessible F1 events can be for fans with disabilities.
This was my first Grand Prix, and I was so excited to finally go. I‚Äôd booked the F1 Experiences Live Pit Straight package (not exactly a budget ticket) and reached out months in advance to explain my needs ‚Äì mainly urgent toilet access and limited mobility when walking fast or through crowds. I made it really clear that I carry a ""Can‚Äôt Wait"" card due to my Crohn‚Äôs and need bathroom access urgently at times.
Here‚Äôs how it went:
Thursday ‚Äì Track Experience Day:
No seating in the main areas during waiting times for the pit walk or guest appearances. I had to stand for hours, which caused joint pain.
No visible bathrooms near the food trucks, so I avoided eating altogether in case I needed the toilet quickly.
The pit lane walk was late in the day, and most garages were closing down due to curfew ‚Äì it felt like others who went earlier got a more engaging experience.
Friday‚ÄìSunday ‚Äì Race Days:
My grandstand seat (Row 2, Seat 134 on the Pit Straight Grandstand) was not near the extra care court, despite requests. I had to walk through heavy crowds to reach it ‚Äì not ideal when you physically can‚Äôt move fast or stand comfortably.
On Saturday, I had an arthritis flare-up and couldn‚Äôt make it back to my seat. I spent most of the day in the care court instead.
The extra care court staff were amazing ‚Äì they offered me a chair and even helped with ice for my knee. But I missed out on watching most of the race from my actual seat because it was just too far from the bathroom.
The bigger issue:
It honestly feels like basic accessibility at F1 events is tied to VIP ticket levels. If you want decent toilet access, seating support, or less walking, you have to spend thousands. That‚Äôs not right.
Accessible event planning shouldn‚Äôt be treated as a luxury add-on. I paid over ¬£1,400 for my ticket and still ended up spending half the weekend worrying about whether I could reach a toilet in time.
As a fan, a content creator, and someone living with chronic illness, I want to enjoy the sport I love without feeling like I don‚Äôt belong at the track. And I know I‚Äôm not the only one.
Final thoughts:
F1 needs to do better. Accessibility shouldn't depend on how much you can afford. I‚Äôd love to see:
Clearly marked accessible toilets and seating near all grandstands.
Disability support staff onsite for guidance.
More flexibility in seating assignments for those who request help in advance.
Actual disability liaison contacts for fans planning to attend.
I‚Äôll be sharing more content about my experience to raise awareness, but I wanted to start here. If you‚Äôve had a similar experience or know of other venues doing accessibility well, I‚Äôd love to hear about it.
Thanks for reading ‚Äì feel free to share or comment if you think this is a conversation F1 needs to keep having.
Zara","['Did you consider buying tickets for the extra care platform?\n\nMy experience there on Sunday was very good. True the seating was on ground level so not the best view. But near accessible toilets and with personel for care.\n\nAgree that accessible toilets should be available for every ticket option.\n\nAddition: The Netherlands is behind general accessibility. But F1 is regarded as one of the most accessible event of the country. They let an external party Handicap.nl organize it for them. Their only focus on people with disabilities makes it good / great.', 'Sorry that you had such a bad experience. Hope you comments reach the right people and they take it seriously.', 'I sympathize with you because I was at the Dutch GP and it was very difficult to navigate the crowds and the foot traffic at times. \n\nHonestly though I can‚Äôt imagine trying to attend an event like this with Crohns. I grew up attending large sporting events (major league baseball, football, hockey, and basketball) and this is my second F1 GP. I‚Äôve also been to Wacken Open Air festival in Germany with 90k people. Bathrooms are always a problem at any event of this kind. I personally felt that bathroom access at the Dutch GP was decent and better than at Suzuka. The problem wasn‚Äôt accessibility per se (we sat in the pit grand stands, row 1, pretty close to you actually) as we were able to reach them quickly. The problem is simply the sheer volume of people. Foot traffic was insane. It took forever to get anywhere and going from our section (126/127) to where the extra care court was located would have taken a bit outside of going when F1 was on track. \n\nHow could they have done this better? The only thing I can think of would have been simply having more bathrooms and perhaps keep some maintained strictly for folks with urgent needs. But I don‚Äôt think they did a poor job, it‚Äôs just the reality of events this size.\n\nI think the biggest thing they could and should do would be to manage foot traffic. There‚Äôs no gates, lanes, or anything to direct people either in the circuit or outside on the way to the train stations. Just a giant clusterfuck of people jostling their way through. Completely the opposite experience to Japan and it made the whole experience much less pleasant, especially since I get anxiety in large crowds.', ""Can you go through this with us?\n\nhttps://dutchgp.com/app/uploads/2025/08/2025_F1-Netherlands-Wayfinding-Map_Negative_VISUAL.pdf\n\nhttps://oversteer48.com/ben-pon-grandstand-zandvoort/#:~:text=As%20the%20video%20shows%2C%20sitting,your%20view%20of%20Turn%201.\n\nThe pit grandstand (27) where you bought your ticket for (you didn't buy a main grandstand ticket which is nearer to the extra care court) seat 134, from what I can see, has toilets directly underneath it at that location, and there is a stairway access point directly down to it at the back, so you move to the back of the stand of where you are and make your way down to the toilets. Is that not urgent toilet access?\n\nOn the map, wherever there is a food icon, there is a bathroom icon nearby. You say you didn't see a visible bathroom near the food trucks and therefore didn't eat but if you followed the map, which you get with your F1 experience ticket, would you have found one very quickly?\n\nYou also say you are a content creater and you will be sharing more content about your experience and you are starting here, what else will you be sharing?"", 'I‚Äôm sorry that happened and I completely agree they need to do better. I also had a poor accessibility experience in Melbourne attending with someone with mobility issues. It‚Äôs definitely not limited to one location, feels like accessibility is just not prioritised in the planning of fan experience.', 'From what I have read there was a special care zone with own bathrooms but on Saturday your knee played up (not the fault of the track), and on other days it was too busy to get past the crowd.. but what can you expect? It‚Äôs a Crowed event with crowded stands‚Ä¶ \n\nI was there and was impressed with all the toilets (below every stand), with all the support staff, stands, a way to give an SOS trough the app, there were people using wheelchairs and getting special help, lots of medical and support stuff.\n\nIn my opinion you are generalizing the event and stating like you were entitled just because you paid more and are a content creator. It sucks you didn‚Äôt have a great experience, but I do feel like you are placing the event in a bad light for a situation they couldn‚Äôt have handled with everything going on.\n\nEdit: i also watched your VOD and it shows you streaming for 3+ hours multiple times without going to the bathroom once‚Ä¶.', 'Paragraphs man. Please.', 'I‚Äôm seeing lots of Americans thinking we have this right, but as a disabled person at COTA a few years ago, I don‚Äôt think we should be resting on our laurels. \n\nIn my situation, I‚Äôm and older woman that struggles with mobility, but I wasn‚Äôt asking for anything other than what COTA said that it was providing - I knew there would be long walks, long waits and I planned accordingly. What I hadn‚Äôt planned on were shuttles that never came, or shuttles that so full from previous stops that certain locations on the track were without transportation options entirely for what turned out to be hours at a time. \n\nThere was a back-up! Armies of golf carts had been hired, but we learned that with one exception, the only way to get a ride was to bribe them - something they were explicitly not allowed to do. We were once told that ‚Äútips were appreciated‚Äù. Another said, ‚ÄúWe are raising money for charity if you‚Äôd like to make a donation.‚Äù We actually were relieved by the honesty of one woman saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm charging $20 a ride.‚Äù \n\nAs with so many things pertaining to disability rights, improving conditions for the disabled improves them for everyone. Running more shuttles and taking time to ensure all stops have shuttles that can take passengers makes the experience better for everyone. Hiring the golf carts for those with extra needs is a good plan on paper, but when those drivers become extra independent contractors that broke down trust and confidence quickly. \n\nGood planning, good follow through and transparency aren‚Äôt limited to disability access - they are the hallmarks of good event planning. Disabled patrons are often the first to notice when that falls apart, but by the second day, it was evident to most.', 'Unfortunately quite common in every major festival and sporting event. There are simply too many people attending for them to care for people with extra needs.\n\nOften if those facilities are available they will get abused by other people attending too.\n\nIt sounds rough but perhaps these events are better watched from home given your conditions.', 'Are you from the states?

They lost Wheatley, Newey, Max and Jos' trust and a ton of public goodwill towards the team just to‚Ä¶ fire Horner some months later."", ""Is this a new publication? I'm unfamiliar with it"", 'Fantastic interview, and well worth the read.  \n\nThere\'s a kid, handed a box of parts that was once a race car, jigsawing them back together, collecting fabricating skills to do it..  \n\n>I‚Äôve been tremendously fortunate in my career to work with John Barnard, Adrian Newey, Ross Brawn, Pat Symonds, Rory Byrne. I feel awful for leaving anyone out because there‚Äôve been so many. I‚Äôve worked with Flavio Briatore to Christian Horner; I‚Äôve seen both ends of the spectrum. And of course, you learn from all of those experiences and those people.\n\nThat quote speaks a lot.    Even mentioned and accredited Binotto.  \n\nOld school physical hands and knees, working from the bottom to the top, tutelage from 90% of the all-time greats, and also crediting some of the successful managers from the other side of the business and the lesson he learnt.\n\nPerfect marriage. \n\nAlso the quote:\n\n>I once had a very good conversation with Pat Symonds about my career aspirations and where I see myself, and I had to make a choice at that point: go down the managerial route and the people route, or stick with the cars and the engineering that I‚Äôd loved for years. And what F1 taught me more than anything was the power of a team‚Äîand I loved that. At Benetton, when we were fighting for a championship, everyone was looking for the last scrap of performance. I can‚Äôt tell you the energy that it gives you, and it keeps you young, so I made the decision to go into a management career. I‚Äôve never looked back, frankly.\n\n>I love the incredible creativity, the work that the engineering geniuses like Mattia Binotto can create with the right tools. But more than that, I‚Äôve loved managing people, building teams, guiding people in their career paths, seeing them come in as a junior employee and then ending up as a senior employee. I love all of that, and I love building teams, so it‚Äôs just a bigger team to put together as team principal than it was as a sporting director or mechanic.\n\n\nIt\'s the ""seeing them come in as a junior employee and then ending up as a senior employee. I love all of that.""', '100%.  The guy was arguably the real reason of their dominance.  \n\nThat\'s the problem with domination, and people have seen it in the Merc downfall.    Team dominates year after year, and no promotions for the key players.   Really showed that bad management style of Toto.  He kept key people in the same positions to maintain the status quo, to impress the board.   \n\nA lot of Toto fans will hate to read this, but Toto bought his way into the sport with Williams.  Lucked into a Merc role after Ross Brawn had to fall on the sword after the illegal tyre test.    In business, it would be called a ""hostile takeover"" by Toto.  No way the board got rid of Ross Brawn if someone wasn\'t earworming them behind the scenes.  Like the Mansour toppling Ron.  \n\nLauda and Toto were at loggerheads, which people forget, and only after Lauda\'s passing, the whole Toto <3 Lauda stuff came to appear.\n\nHaving someone like a Wheately, a James Vowles, or a Paddy Lowe, on a team, where the progression ceiling is just a dead end for years....\n\nAt least someone like Zak Brown recognised that career stagnation of the key people, is a fast course to failure.    Create different position names, where it\'s like a promotion to a new role etc.  Reward people and promote.   Stella for example.  Leaves Ferrari with Alonso, as he knows the Ferrari culture of modern times.   Works his way up from Race Engineer to TP.  \n\nRob Smedley should have been given Ferrari TP a long long time ago.  Long-term F1 key person, and he just left the sport because of that ceiling.\n\nOld school mentality, like Ron in McLaren, having Whitmarsh as the trainee to the crown.  Seasons pass, person still holds on, thinking ... the day will come... and then the day comes, and it\'s too late.  It\'s old school Independent Team mentality.  \n\nHorner shouled have stepped aside, given himself a new role description like Zak, and elevated Wheatley to TP.\n\nMuch like Toto showed that he wasn\'t a natural leader, trying to keep the status quo, rather than reward people to stop them from leaving.', ""Horner's reputation could be a factor but it is also a natural situation that people who have been in their position for quite a long time look for something new. The same happened at Mercedes, a lot of other teams and companies in general around the world. Wheatley could have been a logical successor just like James Vowles at Mercedes but the timing wasn't right. It took too long for the Red Bull HQ to find a way to fire Horner."", 'Why i this argument only ever made about red bull when Merc are in exactl the same situation?', ""It's the site Mike Spinelli put up after he sold Jalopnik, way back in the day."", 'Based on what was Wheatley the ‚Äûreal reason‚Äú, you really need to explain that.\n\nAlso how are the teams supposed to give those promotions what do you do with the people already in that position.\xa0', "">\xa0That's the problem with domination, and people have seen it in the Merc downfall.

Step down and promote JV to keep him?\n\n\nEvery NBA NFL AFL Soccer team has this problem year after year of dominating.

The soonest Piastri can clinch is COTA, if Norris scores 0 points and Verstappen scores less than 71 in the next 4 races. If Piastri were to win every GP, he would clinch in Vegas no matter what Norris does (even if Norris were to win the COTA and Brazil sprints, and Piastri scored 0 in them). If Piastri were to win every race (GP and Sprint), he would clinch in Brazil provided Norris finishes 3rd in at least two races or 4th or below in at least one race.

**WCC:** there were no eliminations in the constructor's championship this race, with half the field being eliminated last time out in Hungary. Even with Norris' DNF, McLaren can still break 1000 points, and owing to Ferrari's double DNF, they continue with more than double the points of 2nd place. 

The soonest McLaren can clinch is still Baku, which they will be guaranteed to do with either 2 1-2's or a 1-2 and a 1-3 in Monza and Baku. As Baku is the 17th round, they would clinch 70.83% of the way through the season, which would be the 6th fastest ever, behind 1961 Ferrari, 1988 McLaren, 1960 Cooper, and 1963 and 65 Lotus; and ahead of teams like 2004 Ferrari and 2023 Red Bull.","['My boy Albon keeping himself in the title fight.', 'Phew Albon still in contention üòÆ\u200düí®', 'Great weekend for Lewis, didn‚Äôt lose ground to Charles üò¢', 'I hope for no more blown engines or crashes.

Sainz is not owed anything, but why penalize him?

I thought the rules are there to define right-of-way, not prohibit being close to someone while on the outside.

These rules of engagement are not conducive for actual racing. A driver can simply be ahead at the apex, know they have right of way, meaning they can just drive to the outside of the corner knowing they cannot be challenged, or if an accident occurs knowing they will not be at fault.

We need cars to go side by side to overtake, it‚Äôs just a fact. If a car can hold the outside line, for almost the entire corner, and be almost in line or at least half way up to the car alongside it, the inside driver should be required to leave one cars width in the exit. 

The current rules allow two cars in to a corner, but only one to come out. If two go in, two should come out. We are losing classic battles and excitement in the sport.
