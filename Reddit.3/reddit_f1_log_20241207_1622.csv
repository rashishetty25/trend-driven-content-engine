And just 11 when his soon-to-be Ferrari team-mate won his maiden world title the following season; on the final corner of the final lap of the final race.\n\nYou might think that historic moment – the sport’s first black driver, a generational talent and hero to millions of young karters around the world,\xa0winning the world title\xa0– would make an impression on a motorsport-mad boy growing up in Monaco, the playground of Formula One’s elite. But you would be wrong.\n\n“Actually I think I’m a bit of an outlier in the paddock, because I didn’t really watch Formula One growing up,” Leclerc confesses when I ask for his earliest memories of the man he will\xa0soon be calling his team-mate.\n\n“Every weekend I had free, I was with my father on a karting track, and we’d just drive. That’s what I loved doing most. So actually, I don’t have many memories of watching F1 or Lewis in his first seasons.\n\n“I do remember a bit, the reaction to what happened \\[at Interlagos\\]. Everyone being like ‘That was completely crazy!’ But you know, you’re young. Monday I was at school, and I never really got to see it again. It’s very different to, I think, every other driver in the paddock, in that I was just so focused on my own thing and enjoyed so much what I was doing, I didn’t really take an interest…”\n\n# ‘The motivation for Hamilton at Ferrari will be crazy’\n\nSafe to say Leclerc is taking a close interest in Hamilton now. Sitting in Ferrari’s paddock home, surrounded by red shirts and hats to sign, Leclerc is well aware that the now seven-time-world champion is about to turn his – and the team’s – life upside down.\n\nIf he is concerned about the impact\xa0[the arrival of Hamilton](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2024/08/30/lewis-hamilton-ferrari-fans-monza-italian-gp-mercedes/)\xa0might have, he is playing it very cool. The Monegasque, who made history on Friday when he and younger brother Arthur became the first brothers to participate in a practice session as team-mates, is for the moment more concerned with the constructors’ championship battle this weekend in Abu Dhabi. Ferrari begin the weekend just 21 points behind leaders McLaren and Leclerc believes “everything is possible”, although since speaking he has been handed a 10-place grid penalty for a battery change, which seriously hurts the Scuderia’s chances.\n\nWhatever happens this weekend, though, Leclerc accepts scrutiny on him is going to increase tenfold next year once Hamilton decamps to Maranello.\n\nFormula One’s most successful driver has endured a torrid final season at Mercedes and many believe Ferrari are splashing out £50 million a year on a busted flush. Hamilton will be 40 by the time Melbourne rolls around next March and\xa0[some of the language he has used recently](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2024/11/30/qatar-f1-grand-prix-sprint-race-qualifying-latest-live/)\xa0– “I’m definitely not fast any more” in Qatar last weekend a notable example – had a note of despair about it. But Leclerc does not think so.\n\n“I think the boost of motivation he’ll get coming into a team like Ferrari will be crazy,” he predicts. “Lewis is still exceptional. It’s been a tough season for Mercedes as a team. I think they’ve been struggling with the car, and they explored a little bit like we did for those three races after Monaco, where you are exploring with the set-up, and that doesn’t help any of the drivers, and that makes it very, very difficult. Confidence is everything in Formula One.\n\n“But I have no doubts at all that I’ll be facing peak Lewis Hamilton, and that it will be an extremely huge challenge.”\n\n**Full interview:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2024/12/07/charles-leclerc-ferrari-can-revitalise-lewis-hamilton-2025/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2024/12/07/charles-leclerc-ferrari-can-revitalise-lewis-hamilton-2025/)', 'Not with the way he ended this season.', '""He will lose motivated"".', ""Of course.

Probably a very long shot but I can't find anything online.

My family did some of the traditional dancing at the 1993 Grand Prix in Adelaide Aus before it moved to Melbourne.

1h8qgmj,Is it actually that crazy that Red Bull aren’t really considering Yuki? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1h8qgmj/is_it_actually_that_crazy_that_red_bull_arent/,2024-12-07, Discussion,"Let me start it out by saying that I think if it’s solely off driver skill and performance then Yuki deserves the seat (which he does) and has shown good moments through the year. 

But I think there’s some things people aren’t considering about the overall picture which I’m surprised about. 

• Yuki is on a 1 year contract atm at RB(jr) and it seems most expected that if he was to join Red Bull then his contract would carry over. Next year there could be driver openings and there is no real solid evidence that Red Bull are back on the up and not a continued stagnation downwards. 

• If Yuki is good in the Red Bull… then what’s really stopping him from joining another team if his contract will be short? It’s fair to say that after all this time Yuki probably has no loyalty/love for the Red Bull brand so if an equal or better offer came knocking you’d expect him to take it. Plus you have the incoming of Honda  (with a newey) to a team that might break Alonso with another year like this (or maybe stroll gives up, though unlikely). Toyota partnering with Hass who are massively on the rise (how far this partnership could increase is still to see). 

• With Liam they have someone who they will be able to offer a cheaper, longer contract, with a selection of break clauses (not trying to repeat the Perez mistake) who will 100% accept it because he doesn’t have the possible future connections that Yuki has. 

I’m a Son of Law enjoyer and I hope he does well but I’m crazily surprised why Red Bull to them might not want to “waste” a year on a driver they might not be able to keep. ","['Maybe Red Bull know more with them then we do', 'Yuki is a upper midfield driver at best and i believe he is near his ceiling at the moment.\n\nI think RBR thinks Lawson could have the higher ceiling so they are putting the eggs in his basket. As much as i like yuki i think its the smarter bet too. Besides i like Yuki too much to see him crumble next to Max', ""[Why Red Bull doesn't want Tsunoda as Perez's replacement - The Race](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/why-red-bull-doesnt-want-yuki-tsunoda-sergio-perez-replacement/)\n\n>It does not believe that Tsunoda is capable of being consistently at his best alongside Verstappen. There are concerns that he has made mistakes under pressure, and lost his cool over the radio too often - even now, when it has been made clear to him that needs to improve this aspect.  \nAnother suggestion is that his technical feedback is not the strongest, as this was not considered as impressive as Ricciardo’s when the latter was back in the second team.  \nTsunoda’s speed is not the problem, which ironically is why his form versus Lawson does not count against Lawson. Red Bull believes that Tsunoda offers a very good benchmark to judge Lawson, especially given the experience gap, and that Lawson ticks other boxes that Tsunoda does not."", 'It’s not crazy to me that they’re not considering Yuki.\n\nIt’s crazy to me that they’re considering Lawson over him though.', 'Maybe they cannot say anything, until Checo is resolved', 'In my opinion people are forgetting the most important thing for redbull. \n\nDo you believe yuki will work with max on the track and listen to team orders?
