He is listed as the only driver for BRM that season. **This somewhat breaks the trend.** However, the WCC looked very different back in the day. It wasn't called by the same name, only the best finisher of the constructor that race counted towards the point total, etc. (Prior to 1962, the trend remains.)

ETA - user rustyiesty points out below that Richie Ginther also raced for BRM in 1962 and also hadn't won prior. Not sure why Wikipedia doesn't have him listed, but that reduces the scope of the stat to more modern times with the WCC in a format like today.

However, starting in 1967, at least 2 drivers (perhaps more accurately, at least 2 cars) have driven the entire season for the eventual winning constructor. And in every single year, at least one of the drivers had won a Grand Prix in a previous season.

While watching this past race in Abu Dhabi, I noticed during both Verstappen's and Piastri's 10-second penalty, the overall time for the ""stopped"" time in the pit stop showed 13.4 and I think 13.5.

If anything, the stopped work seemed as fast, if not faster than, a typical pit stop, so I was expecting to see 12.something on their overall stopped times.  Does anyone have any idea what is going on here? ","['Teams usually go slightly over the penalty time without touching the car, for safety.\n\nIf they fail to serve the penalty correctly that’s another time penalty on top. Sacrificing an extra half a second to ensure you don’t get another 10 second penalty is just good sense.', 'Two reasons:\n\nThe first is that there is no FIA-representative telling them when they can start working on the car, but it is judged afterward if they waited long enough. The teams have to monitor the time-penalty themselves. Is they go really tight on the 10 seconds, they run the risk of the FIA finding that they are too short, because maybe the guy who is timing started his stopwatch 0.2 or 0.3 seconds too early. In that case, they will get another penalty, so they take a little bit more to be safe.\n\nThe second is that while the work may seem very fast, it will always be slightly slower than with a normal pitstop. These guys work mostly on muscle-memory. They start when the car pulls in. But now they have to wait, and it kind of messes up their rhythm. In an ideal pitstop, the wheelguns are on just before the car fully stops.', 'I think just cause the car is worked on before it\'s ""still"".\n\n\nThe car drives in and even before being perfectly still the wheels are being undone and the mechanics getting hand on it.\n\n\nSo the 2.3 second time is not the total time someone was touching it.

A penalty can be recovered from, it’s highly unlikely you can recover from two though.\n\nThere’ll also be additional human factors involved as well.

In the past you\'ve seen individuals reach for the tire before the the time keeper gives the signal, which creates a new penalty if they\'re judged to have touched the car before the elapsed time has gone by.\n\nMuch easier to simply have the time keeper run the lock \\~1/2 to 1 second longer and have a clean penalty free ""lower stress"" pit stop.']",0,16,0.41,0,144,144,0,0,0.0,0

1hazmn9,I think the 2026 rules are going to hurt overtaking a lot,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hazmn9/i_think_the_2026_rules_are_going_to_hurt/,2024-12-10, Discussion,"You know why no other motorsport allows active aero? Because it bolsters dirty air and reduces slipstream. It's rule number 1 of racing regulations - its why GT3's have bolt-on wings while their road-going counterparts are shapeshifting. In the 2026 F1 regs, teams will be able to toggle between aero modes on most straights at all times - which means dirty downforce creating a huge wake in the corner, and Monza trim down the straights.

[Take it from PlanetF1](https://preview.redd.it/reme6rzr306e1.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=256f7aa727bfea4b22178ba706d0d48b05159c79)

Despite this, DRS is getting removed in 2026. I hate it as much as the next guy but removing the aid that makes 3+ tenths on a straight when you'll have these Project 400 monsters making reduced slipstream, is a recipe for disaster.

  
Downforce decreased by 30%? Surely that is SOME good news for the following car? Nope - its all been sourced from lovely clean ground effect.

[Venturi effect has been the dirty air magic bullet](https://preview.redd.it/cquec0l7706e1.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=6846ac5c3e1250ff14c4edc1523f4fd066b71980)



There is a ""DRS replacement"" for the following car, in the form of an ERS boost. How exciting! Thats way better than DRS, it can be used anywhere including small straights (DRS potency is exponential with speed), gives diversity in overtaking and maybe even a challenge to control the traction!

Oh, it only STARTS to activate at 295kph. And its a gradient that only really kicks in around 310-320. Its somehow even less diverse than DRS. Now every motorway overtake will become even more redundant, and every straight less than a kilometre will be abandoned. 

[You can do the maths](https://preview.redd.it/zzoox5vx706e1.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=9175f92639228e14ce23b006d35f1bfceaedaf5d)

And it depletes the battery so there's not even intrinsic gain for the following car like DRS. Which is so critical when dirty air is gonna be a problem! Funny DRS train battles will perish - now each position swap is a huge battery depletion, if the guy can even get close.



They must be hoping that their vaunted ""inwash"" effect can save the day. But it doesn't fill me with hope that their last amendment from November was to allow more front wing and bargeboard appendages to ""claw back some lap time"". I think 2026 is going to be a massive struggle for on-track action.

  
To people who think the sleuths at the FIA are trustworthy enough to avoid this cock-up - they sat on extensive ground effect for 40 years when it was the cure for dirty air all along, they forced hybrids through while bankrupting 2 teams and providing little value to anybody, and they commissioned the 2017 regs. Also traction control shouldn't've lasted until 2007.  


Its a shame because people will conflate this latest gaffe with the car size reduction, which is a brilliant first step towards tiny, agile, raceable ones. Small (particularly narrow) cars are the best way to create exciting racing. But with extreme dirty air, racing can never initiate in the first place.

(Not to mention it is a markedly small step: Weight reduction is half of what was gained between 2021 and 2022 even IF theres no backsliding. And dimension reductions are less than half of 2016-to-17s gain.)

  
Does this match the public sentiment? Most of the F1 fans I've talked to haven't even looked at the regs. But im interested to hear some opinions. And I'd like to hear from an expert about the active aero stuff, because I am no expert but I find it hard to believe active aero was a productive solution here?","['I think most of the reaction to the regulations are overblown and it’s worth waiting until we see them in action for a few races before forming an opinion', 'I am not saying you are wrong in your worries, but ground effect is not the nectar that makes following easier. It is the reduction of outwashing elements and the reliance of the front wing to control the airflow that helps. You force the teams to use a single plane front wing with no end plate and ensure its width is less that the overall width of the car and you remove outwashing bargeboards, then you will also have cars that are easy to follow without increasing any downforce from the floor. The issue here is that the cars will most likely be slow. Inwashing elements greatly reduce the width of the wake and that is the key to making cars easier to follow.', ""I disagree, or at least, am a bit more optimistic.\n\nConsider that:\n\n- Slower cornering speeds with lower downforce actually creates more potential for varying lines through corner complexes. Additionally, lower downforce places more emphasis on driver skill in braking zones.\n- Cars may have a harder time following due to lack of slipstream and no DRS to overtake, but they will still have battery deployment to bring them alongside and will be able to stay alongside without instability due to inwash aero.\n- Smaller footprint due to reduced length and width means more nimble.\n\nTaking these three things together and what I think we will see (and what F1 is aiming for) is less 'push to pass' on the straights (though some 'push to draw alongside') but more battling / overtakes through corner complexes, which I think could be significantly more exciting and is certainly more reliant on driver skill."", ""When I saw the news about DRS being removed I also got worried about overtaking getting worse, not only that but small front wing damage will probably force most drivers to pit, while with the current regs you usually can keep racing with only a small performance cost.\n\nIt looks like most of the changes have been made so the engines can be raced without making the cars incredibly slow on straights. I have the feeling that overtaking will be very hard in 2026, but I hope I'm wrong."", ""To me this reads mostly like a bunch of half-informed hot takes patched together. I'm not saying the concerns aren't unwarranted, but they are way more complex than they seem. If these concerns can be reached through some thinking and discussion they have definitely been evaluated and addressed quite a while ago.\n\nEdit: also speaking from experience, ground effect is not the magic bullet to solve racing, it was just aggressively marketed to create hype for the 2022 reg changes. Sure it does help to some extent but great racing can be achieved without it and poor racing can still happen with it."", ""Reduction in downforce doesn't really matter, it's the reduction in downforce while following another car that's important."", ""Before the current ruleset people were constantly crying that F1 was going to be ruined, etc. etc.\n\nWe'll see"", ""I do agree that the movable aero doesn't seem like it's going to create the easiest racing opportunities. However, we need to wait and see just how powerful this p2p system is. There's a chance that can overcome the lack of a proper slipstream effect."", ""the ground effect cars showed no improvement on overtaking, and as we saw in the last race in this season, a car following close to another will lose downforce drastically, and DRS was just a push to pass created to mitigate the inability of those giant cars to overtake on corners.\n\nThere's also the problem of ground effect cars being much harder to drive then conventional ones as the downforce generated changes drastically if you're going over a kerb or if the track is wet."", 'More drag and/or less power aid overtaking the most. Both make the slipstream effect stronger. But instead they want to make the cars even faster on a straight line which will make overtaking harder.\n\nI predict there will be a panic rule chenge for mid 2026 because the racing is so terrible.']",0,26,0.31,0,26,26,0,0,-0.020000000000000018,0
