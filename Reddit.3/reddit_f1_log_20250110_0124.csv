The results of this were apparently dismal for Doohan and so the rumours came out.\n\nIt’s never been about Colapinto.

If Doohan does poorly, he’ll be replaced. The midfield is tight - a highest finish decided P6 vs P7 in 2022, P7 vs P8 was 3 points in 2023. Alpine aren’t being ruthless for no reason.\n\nAs for why sign him in the first place?

Here are a few I could think of but I'll update the list as I see them:

Danny Ric: Shoey

Lando Norris: Champaign slam (podium)

Carlos Sainz: 🎶 Smooth Operator 🎶

Max Verstappen: ""Simply Lovely"", iRacing logo (queerhedgehog)

George Russel: T-pose + weird catchphrases (Vegetable_Comfort366)
