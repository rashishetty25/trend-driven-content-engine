Just once, let alone multiple times in his professional career. People would be calling for his head.

What irritates me is when Jack was struggling all we heard about was how he is going to lose his seat the poor fella must of had pressure from everywhere, but now Franco is struggling and there doesn't seem to be anywhere near the pressure. Why is that? The media doesn't seem to even want to talk about him or even interview him. I saw at least 10 interviews with Jack before he stood down asking him the worst questions, and some of them were very rude. Why the different treatment?","['as an aussie it was pretty rough watching the treament of doohan. everything with him was a comparison to his dad (way more than they ever have with sainz/sainz)and then basic ""how did pace feel today?""\n\nthe narrative the whole time was essentially he wasnt good enough and waiting him out til he was replaced, which seemed to be a plan regardless of how he did', ""Same reason we don't hear about Lawson vs Tsunoda.

The Doohan Drama was all about if and when he is getting replaced by Colapinto. Now Colapinto is there and even though his initial performances weren\'t that good, there is also no immediate threat for him. Nobody is waiting in line right now, so there is not much drama to report on.', 'I’d argue that the Alpine isn’t a tractor, it has shown some really good pace especially in Bahrain so the pace is there. The issue is that Gasly has been the only one to come even close to extracting it. Colapinto seems to be pretty similar to Doohan in terms of pace which makes it looks like the millions Alpine spent to buy him out of the contract was pointless given they could have just kept Doohan in. \n\nHaving said that, Alpine are last in the constructors and the only way they improve on that is by giving Colapinto or Doohan some bloody stability. Time in the car is scarce and precious and you need to become an expert in how it handles to be able to extract the lap time and be able to give solid feedback regarding the set up. Just look at how Sainz and Hamilton aren’t fully up to speed yet despite how good they are. \n\nAs for the media, there are far more interesting stories on the grid and this one is just a B Tech version of the Tsunoda at Red Bull story.', ""Probably just that the media is likely going to report on rumours that are backed up by reliable sources and there's no rumours that I'm aware of surrounding Colapinto at the moment. I'm sure if rumours start the reporting on them will start."", 'The assumption was that Doohan would get replaced by Colapinto because he shows more potential and he has more advertising backing him. There’s less risk of him getting replaced because of that. FWIW, these questions are being asked. Briatore was just asked in Spain if Schumacher would replace Colapinto this season.

Also extremely experienced and worked in a championship winning team for multiple years. \n\nHis 2024 season - whilst pointless - was very dominant against Zhou which proved that he’s still rapid.']",52,20,0.93,52,19,19,40,13,0.050000000000000044,40

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Incredible episode. Bananas.', 'Who had the second best car in 1987 - Lotus, McLaren or Ferrari?', ""How much of an impact on their performance do you think Ferrari's Silverstone suspension update is going to have? \n\nIf it allows them to run the car at the intended height, then I believe it could be a real turning point in their season. Possibly putting them at a similar pace to the McLarens on some tracks.\n\nObviously, it's too late to make any difference at the sharp end of the championship standings. However, it could make the individual races a lot more interesting with Charles and Lewis joining the Oscar, Lando and Max fight."", ""A question for those of you with F1TV but who watch one of the foreign language international feeds i.e. French, German etc. When you cast, does it cast in your chosen language? Because when I cast from my phone, it switches to the Sky English feed when it hits my TV. When I cast from my laptop, it stays in French. But to add to my confusion, when I cast archived races from my phone, they cast in French. \n\nIt's not a huge hassle, but I'd rather not drag out the laptop every race weekend."", 'Does anyone know what the view looks like from row 1 of the Red Bull grandstand for the Austrian Grand Prix? The tickets are a good price but I’m concerned the view will be obstructed', ""Can we just get rid of Crofty now, please?  His mistake rate in commentary is just getting worse and worse.  It really snaps me out of the race when he gets a driver or a turn wrong, really basic things.\n\nI liked Paul di Resta as a commentator very much.  He was really sharp, and his insights were concise and enlightening.\n\nBernie is very good with her expert knowledge too.\n\nRosberg is very opinionated, but knowledgable, observant, and exciting.\n\nMartin Brundel is great, particularly at enthusiastically explaining the basics for newbies, and I think he only becomes stuffy when he's working with Crofty and falls into the Old English man from the Home Counties mode. (Add Ted in the mix and it's insufferably off the scale!)  I hope his son is better when he inevitably gets the nepo job (it is f1, after all!)\n\nI much prefer the Coulthard/Webber/McKenzie combo - but it's hard to get a live race with them any more.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these and other commentary teams?\n\n(Danica Patrick, eek!)"", 'Who were the candidates to replace Rosberg at Mercedes after he retired post-2016? And who did you think was going to take the seat at first? Was Bottas always on ""pole"", or were other options, like Wehrlein, more likely at some point considering Valtteri still had an active Williams contract at that point?', 'I love what liberty media has done with F1 so far \n\nAs an American and relatively new F1 fan I’ve gotta say I like what liberty media is doing with the brand. As a kid I had the F1 PS2 games and my dad used to tell me all about Andretti and Jackie Stewart but in the last 5-6 years I’ve really actually started watching myself. (Most of the time i still wake up to the end of the race😂) Being from Florida we watched a lot of NASCAR, the Daytona 500 was the crown jewel (I recommend anyone here to go to the Daytona 500 it’s way cooler than you expect and I am no redneck) I’ve gotta say I love what liberty media is doing. The cost caps, wind tunnel caps etc have created a lot of parity and it seems like there are actually multiple teams that if they play their cards right can win multiple races every season. We’re used to our sports here having a lot of parity and I’m really glad to see it in F1.\n\nWould love to hear the European perspective on how they’ve done, what changes you like and dislike and what you would like to see in the future (Btw Cadillac is gonna come in guns blazing and show yall we know how to do more than turn left😉)', 'Just saw that Lewis Hamilton has blamed the car again.The downfall of this don needs to be studied in schools.
