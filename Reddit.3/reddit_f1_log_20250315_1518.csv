1jbrcyn,So is the Redbull that hard of a car to drive? Or is Max just Schumacher 1997-type level?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jbrcyn/so_is_the_redbull_that_hard_of_a_car_to_drive_or/,2025-03-15, Discussion,"Seriously, at this point I don‚Äôt even know what to believe anymore. There‚Äôs no way all his past teammates are this bad. Gasly, Albon, Perez, Lawson all over 6 tenths or more slower than Max in the same car. Hell, Perez was closer in the 2020 RP than he was in 2021 RB, meaning RP was probably the 2nd quickest car in 2020, but Max is just an alien.

It‚Äôs very early; but Albon will probably be at least equal or very very close to Sainz. Obvs it his first quali session, but rarely did drivers close such a deficit over a season and then gain it on top. 

I‚Äôm genuinely starting to think Max might have spoken the truth when he said in 2020 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 2 tenths faster than anyone else‚Äù.  And that ‚Äúeveryone else‚Äù included the likes of prime or at least very close to prime Hamilton.

I haven‚Äôt seen this level of domination since Schumacher in the 90‚Äôs. Just levels above everyone. That generation was also made to look bad by him, because great drivers like Barrichello or Irvine who beat almost all of their other teammates, including legends of the 80‚Äôs but also future talents(hell, old Rubens was matching a prime Jensen Button; who wasn‚Äôt that far off Lewis) were absolutely demolished by Schumacher. And the media couldn‚Äôt accept Schumacher was that much better than everyone else, so the entire generation was just deemed weak.

I think Max at this point has the same effect, however this generation is more proven because we‚Äôll have direct comparison between Leclerc-Vettel, Norris-Ricciardo, Russell-Lewis,  Leclerc-Lewis, Albon-Sainz etc.

","[""Probably a mix of both. Max is an all time great calibre of driver but also the car is very difficult to find a balance with that gives the driver confidence. Max can live with that, his teammates haven't been able to and it widens the gap between them.\n\nIf the car was more compliant his teammates would be closer.

They're not top drivers, so it's not exactly a big surprise that they are lagging behind Max. OK, maybe a bit too early to judge Lawson, but.... having followed his career for years, he's not really given the impression that he's a top driver. And Red Bull *is* a top team."", 'Of course Max is on another level but here are multiple factors to consider.\nLawson is new at RB, it‚Äôs his first full season, his teammate is the current four time world champion and Max apparently has gotten all the upgrades.\nI wouldn‚Äôt read too much into it.', ""Here we go again!

On the first day of practice for the Australian GP, all 20 Formula 1 cars were equipped with two additional cameras, which were aimed directly at the front wing and rear wing from both sides. A detailed deployment plan determined which camera was filming which driver in which practice session.\n\n> The 50 gram cameras recorded continuously. This meant that a Formula 1 driver could be at the front right and rear left in the first practice session and vice versa for his team-mate. And the other way round in the second session.\n\n> The world governing body began to keep a closer eye on the teams last year. Word had got around that some cars were equipped with front wings that bent under increasing load in order to shift the aero balance from the front to the rear. Of course, they all passed the static load tests.\n\n>Special high-resolution cameras. \nAt the Belgian GP, the FIA began filming the front wings in order to obtain more information about the degree of bending. The test was continued until the 2024 season finale and ultimately led to a tightening of the static tests from the Spanish GP onwards.\n\n> At the Azerbaijan GP last year, it then emerged that the teams were also playing tricks with the rear wings. McLaren bent the flap upwards on the outside, Ferrari pushed the main blade further down on the inside when the DRS was not activated. The aim of both was to increase the gap between the main blade and the flap. This reduces drag and increases top speed. In technical jargon, the practice is called ‚Äúmini-DRS‚Äù.\n\n> This has now led to the FIA also monitoring the rear wings on video during all Friday practice sessions in Melbourne. However, the referees are not satisfied with the images from the normal TV cameras. The association‚Äôs special cameras have three times the resolution of the TV images.\n\n> No disqualifications in Melbourne. According to Article 3.15.17 of the Technical Regulations, the gap between the wing elements may not increase by more than two millimetres if a force of 750 newtons is applied to the left and right of the wing when stationary.\n\n> If the video recordings show that the gap widens by more than the permitted two millimetres when driving, the FIA can slap the Formula 1 team concerned on the wrist and ask them to rectify the situation. However, disqualification is not possible.\n\n> It is rumoured from association circles that the rules could be tightened in the short term if there are too many violations in the rear as well as the front wing. Otherwise, the analyses will be used to specify the rules for the 2026 Formula 1 season.', 'I love how teams always find ways around rules to find advantages. \n\nThis game of cat and mouse between them and the FIA is one of my favourites things about this sport', 'Repent sinners!

Also Hadjar was seven tenths quicker than Lawson in Q1 and Tsunoda was 8 tenths faster in Q1. Comsidering the gap between Lawson and Tsunoda was not that big last year when they were team mates it surely begs the question, at least in qualifying pace, is the Racing Bull faster than the Red Bull?! 
Comsidering Yuki was less than two tenths off Max you also have to wonder what time would Max out in in that machine? What he still be third? would he be lower? Could he even be better?
