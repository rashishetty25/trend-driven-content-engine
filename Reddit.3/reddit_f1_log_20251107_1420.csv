Fernando had 3. Under the 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 system, Kimi needed to score a win, while Fernando no more than a third place, Lewis no more than a sixth (Kimi had an advantage in the number of race wins). Regardless of another disastrous race from Lewis, Ferrari, with their two drivers, had a 100% perfect performance that weekend in Interlagos. \n\nI still remember that weekend. Everything was just perfect for Ferrari. The weather was good, so F2007 avoided its weakness at lower temp. The reliability in that year was not the best, but it was strong during the clutch time.

1oq808b,The day I (maybe) ruined Senna's workout,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oq808b/the_day_i_maybe_ruined_sennas_workout/,2025-11-06, Throwback,"During the 1991/92 summer in Brazil, with Senna's popularity reaching stratospheric levels, it was impossible for him to run on the streets without being constantly stopped by fans. I remember seeing on TV news how he had made an arrangement with Petrobras to use the oil terminals in the city of Angra dos Reis, where he had a summer house, for his exercise. He'd moor his speed boat and have long straights to run in peace.

My dad was an oil tanker captain and at the time was in charge of the one in the background. I was staying with him for a few days before he set off to another trip and one day, in the late afternoon, someone called his quarters to say Senna was jogging by the ship. ""Maybe you could take the boy to meet him."" I was 13 at the time.

So we took the camera and went down. Senna passed by us going towards the end of the terminal where the ship was and dad, wearing an impeccable white uniform for some official function later that day, asked for a picture. ""I'll go down to the end and when I come back,"" he replied. We waited just beyond the safety lines and, when he got back, he stopped, wiped the sweat from his face and briefly stood for a snapshot before walking on to his boat and leaving.

Shortly after, I realized we had missed the opportunity of asking if he would like to go onboard. As a lover of powerful machines, I figured there was a good chance Senna might have accepted an invitation and would have enjoyed seeing an engine room larger than most homes.

A while back, I was at the barber when F1 came about and I mentioned this episode. And then, over three decades later, it hit me: Senna went to the terminal to avoid being interrupted during his run, and interrupt his run was precisely what I had done. He didn't seem mad about it, but the fact he left soon after suggests he might have called it a day because I had already messed with his pace and maybe afraid local workers would also take similar liberties after seeing the example. I wonder if he maintained the workout routine there after having his safe space invaded, though it was unlikely some other kid would be around to do the same thing.

A couple of years later, I attended his funeral in São Paulo. I printed out some words of farewell on a piece of paper and stuck a copy of this photo, which I dropped on the pile of mementos from fans by the entrance of the State Legislature. I like to think it's kept in an archive somewhere along with thousands of other pieces from that day, though that ultimately doesn't really matter.

No other racetrack puts as much strain on tires as the Losail circuit. It is the combination of many extremely fast corners, rough asphalt, and aggressive curbs at the exit of corners that pushes the rubber rolls to their limits.\n\nTires have been the focus of attention at all three Grands Prix held in the emirate since 2021. At the Qatar debut in 2021, Pirelli counted four tire failures during the race. Each time, it was the left front tire that was affected. Valtteri Bottas, George Russell, Nicholas Latifi, and Lando Norris had stayed on the track too long on one set of tires despite high wear.\n\nThis was a warning to Pirelli for future races. When Formula 1 returned to Qatar two years later, the problem worsened. Not only were the ground effect cars 50 kilograms heavier than their predecessors, they also achieved significantly higher speeds in the fast corners. To increase the radius, the drivers allowed themselves to be carried far beyond the kerbs.\n\nDriving on the bumpy track caused breaks between the tread and the carcass. Moving the track limits inwards did not help. In order to ensure the race could be completed safely, Pirelli and the FIA imposed a running time limit on the tires. No set of tires was allowed to be driven for more than 18 laps. That meant at least three pit stops per participant.\n\nFor 2024, the curbs were flattened slightly. This eliminated the risk of tread separation. However, the fear of tire damage remained. Unlike on other tracks, the problem at Losail is not thermal wear, but abrasion. “When the tread becomes too thin, the tire is no longer protected. Then a stone or a small splinter is enough to tear the rubber layer,” explains Pirelli's head of motorsport Mario Isola.\n\nLast year, Pirelli left it at a recommendation. The teams were asked not to drive more than 24 laps on one set of tires. But as soon as the race started, some teams ignored the warning and, for strategic reasons, covered longer distances than Pirelli had requested.\n\nLewis Hamilton and Carlos Sainz both suffered a blowout on their left front tire almost simultaneously after 34 laps. Both had driven over debris from a rearview mirror that a Williams had lost on the home straight with their heavily worn tires.\n\nTo prevent a repeat, Pirelli is currently discussing a mandatory mileage limit with the teams for the penultimate World Championship race on November 30. The maximum permitted mileage is still under negotiation.\n\nIn the end, however, it will mean that all drivers will have to change tires at least twice during the race. Pirelli does not want to prescribe a specific number of mandatory pit stops, as this would mean having no control over the number of laps per set of tires."", ""Why shouldnt tires burst when overused? If a driver risks it and it blows up, it's their fault not pirellis. Isn't this exactly what we want? And softs not going for 40 fucking laps?"", 'I have a foolproof plan to avoid this issue in future\n\n\nDrop Qatar\xa0', 'May I suggest….wets?', 'All the people talking about giving recommendations and leaving the teams to deal with it, I recommend you watch the NASCAR Cup highlights from Sunday…', ""It's about having stint limits like 2023. Last year, teams were essentially pushing the tyres to the puncture limit because the wear is high, but the tyres dont lose performance accordingly"", 'i thought the whole intent with the tire system was to try to encourage varied strategy and incentivize pit stops. they have the task of making tires good enough for the cars to perform but also bad enough to where people need to pit due to pace or dnf concerns. \n\nas far as what was described here teams pushing their tires to the absolute limit before risking a dnf sounds like the goal being met. i guess not in the way they wanted to and perhaps safety is enough of a concern, but yeah.', 'Let the teams decide how much to push it', 'How about give the recommendation about what the tyres can take and then let the teams take the risk on how far to go with them.
