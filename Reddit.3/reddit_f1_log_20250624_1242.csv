Recently I‚Äôve been doing a fair bit of research on driver‚Äôs styles. I‚Äôm trying to see who was fastest no matter what really. For example:

Ayrton Senna - extremely fast in his era. Unique style was akin to how traction control works, and enabled him to stay on the edge. Great longevity going from twitchy turbo cars to NA V12s, but difficult to predict how this would have fared in the TC V10s era. Was showing adaptability at Williams in 94, however. 

Schumacher - preferred understeer contrary to popular belief, however after his time at Benetton he adapted to a pointy oversteer setup which kept him at the limit more consistently than other drivers. But in the V8 era he struggled: he couldn‚Äôt use his ‚Äòrallycrosser‚Äô style to its full potential, and it‚Äôs also important to factor in age, he wasn‚Äôt as sharp. 

Fangio - the master of the four wheel drift. Only drove as quick as was necessary, demonstrating so at the 1957 German GP. Perfect style for his time.

Jean Alesi - one of my personal favourites, however less of an efficient style, more entertaining. Often took the car far over the limit. Right places, wrong times in the peak of his career. 

These are just some off of the top of my head, I know I‚Äôm missing out many massive names. In your opinion, how was the penultimate example for how to go fast, or the best all round driver?

1lj4f6h,Should McLaren prioritise Oscar Piastri over Lando Norris?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1lj4f6h/should_mclaren_prioritise_oscar_piastri_over/,2025-06-24, News,,"['They should continue doing what they are doing now. Mostly there is no other driver that would come close to their points. Let them fight!!', 'Nah let em go. If it was a 100 point gap maybe, but Lando is still well in the fight.', 'How often do they need to repeat their approach until people accept it?\n\nThere will not be a priority, unless one driver has much better chances and a driver from another team is their challenger. End of Story.', ""Do these guys understand that we aren't even halfway yet? If Lando had passed oscar They would have been 5-5 in races and only separated by a couple of points, still 22 points Is less than a win, i get that every point Is important but we are in June, 10 Races in , with 14 to go a 45 ish point gap to max could be gained even with team orders, only if we get to a point where one Is clearly out of the title fight, as much as Norris Is struggling he Is by no means out of the title fight nor will McLaren now be nowhere near Merc or Redbull for every race this season"", 'Until it is mathematically impossible for one to win the championship, the answer is no.', ""Let them fight until it becomes a necessity. If another Canadian GP happens, then a conversation needs to be had. However, if they take each other out a la Rosberg and Hamilton, then they'll probably need to institute some kind of order. Maybe some kind of agreement like Senna and Prost made about whoever makes the first corner would win the race."", 'Point difference is not too big between them, WCC is pretty much over and they are only fighing between themselves for WDC so I don‚Äôt see why they should prioritise now.', ""I'm so fed up of this conversation already. Why would they even need to prioritise him? The WDC is going to come down to one of the two McLaren drivers, whichever is the better will come out on top naturally. They don't need to prioritise one of them.\n\nNo one should be in favour of team orders in a situation like this. It's completely against the spirit of competition"", ""They didn't prioritise Lando last year when he was miles ahead and allowed them to fight each other even despite threat from Max being way more pronounced, as evident by the actual championship results...\n\nWhy should that change now?""]",0,159,0.42,0,145,145,0,14,-0.030000000000000027,0
