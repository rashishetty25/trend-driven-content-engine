Now it’s just a case of growing the numbers at early levels of karting to hopefully find the quick ones (with funding preferably) that have the speed of the very best men and boys.', '> It’s been nearly 4,000 days since a woman participated in a Formula One practice session. That driver, Susie Wolff, is now the managing director of F1 Academy, the all-female series. Since then, no woman has matched Wolff’s achievement. But Katie Denver, who works on the championship’s performance and talent development, said there’s “a huge buzz around” women in motorsport. The increasing commercial interest in the sport reflects growing confidence.\n\n> “People are starting to realize that we will genuinely see female drivers at the top levels of the sport, and I think everybody’s just desperate to make it happen now,” she continued. “We’ve got a long way to go, but we’ve got so much potential. Achieving this is looking more and more encouraging every day.”\n\n> And Denver is right, from a business standpoint. Since F1 Academy launched in 2023, its social media presence has grown to 1.38 million followers across Instagram, X, YouTube and TikTok. The races air in over 170 global territories, and sponsors range from motorsport veterans such as Tommy Hilfiger, Puma and TAG Heuer to newer names in the racing space, including Charlotte Tilbury and hair product company Wella Professionals. For the last two seasons, all 10 F1 teams have provided backing to teams and drivers, and this commitment will continue.', 'Teams would jump on every female talent good enough. Marketing value would be insane.\n\nBut there are also thousands of really good male drivers that will never get a chance because there are 20 better ones (with better connections).', 'Until a female driver is competitive in F3 and F2, no. That of course, can realistically happen, its just that the supply of female drivers is so scant to begin with, and that the few tend to drive in many series all at once. Ie. Doriane Pin', 'Not really. Women aren’t in the sport bc fewer women are into karting. Talent pool is smaller, less make it. Floersch is the best so far and she finished 23rd in f3…', ""No.\n\nThe issue is the grass roots level, so few women get into motorsport that finding good ones is incredibly difficult.\n\nThat's where the issue lies, if your sample is 100 people you're not going to find a Lewis Hamilton because they're the one in 100,000 or whatever.\n\nThat's the issue. If there was a female driver that genuinely looked competent enough she'd be snapped up by teams, they'd be fighting each other sign her\xa0"", ""The pathway isn't holding women back, if there was a female driver who was genuinely good they would get 20x the publicity (sponsors) than their male counterparts of comparable results.\n\nLook at someone like Chadwick for instance, noone knows the name of the teammate that was consistently beating her in British F3 before he had to quit due to lack of funds."", 'Can women actually get past the physicality involved in F1 though?
