That’s an eye-watering figure, even for F1 standards, but would a move to AM make sense for Max?

Right now, joining Aston Martin might seem ill-advised, but F1’s competitive landscape is notoriously unpredictable. When you break it down, Aston Martin’s offer actually starts to make some sense. (It’s sourced to the Daily Mail, so take it with a massive grain of salt).

Maybe you think I’ve lost my mind, but hear me out.

They’ve landed Adrian Newey, the most successful car designer in F1 history, and handed him a salary bigger than most drivers. Over several decades, Newey has been the architect of countless championship-winning cars, and his move from Red Bull to Aston Martin has already sent shockwaves through the paddock.

They’ve also rebuilt their leadership team, bringing in Andy Cowell, the mastermind behind Mercedes’ dominant turbo-hybrid engines, and Ferrari’s Enrique Cardile as Chief Technical Officer. These are big names with proven track records, and it’s clear that Aston Martin isn’t messing around when it comes to preparing for the 2026 regulations. With their obsessive focus on nailing the next generation cars, they are clearly aiming for a transformation similar to Mercedes’ rise in 2014.

Obviously, Verstappen’s decision won’t just come down to money. He’s a serial winner, and Aston Martin needs to convince him they can deliver a car capable of winning titles. But when you look at it, there are a few parallels to when Lewis Hamilton left McLaren for Mercedes in 2013—and that turned out pretty well.

My biggest reservation? Lance Stroll. Can Aston Martin realistically challenge for a Constructors’ title with him in the other car? Maybe he’d be a decent number two, but his continued presence in the team feels like it undermines the cutthroat rhetoric of Papa Stroll’s bold ambitions.

What do you think? Could Aston Martin pull off a project like this? And, more importantly, could you see Verstappen actually making the leap?
","['If they fire Stroll, then yes. \n\nAston Martin is not a serious team until Lance is booted.\n\nAlonso + Verstappen would be a comically violent paring.', ""No matter how much they spend, no serious team lines up with owner's son as a driver."", 'I think Max is already done with the FIA and is just finishing his contract before he goes to do something else.', 'Yes. I think it’s more likely that Honda will do a better job  with the engines in 2026 than Red Bull', 'What if its an endurance contract after f1. He still joins AM!', 'They are backed by MBS (the real one)  and the PIF and Aramco.  1 Billion is nothing to them, they will just keep adding Billions till Max says yes.', 'Not unless they can deliver a championship car. There is no way Max is running a midfield car just for a paycheck.', 'The sheer scale of how much money that is is insane even relative to current driver pay. For a billion dollars I think you’d have just about every driver willing to drive a four year old Haas let alone something that is even quasi competitive', 'No. They have not proven they can develop a car. Aston Martin had problems with developing their car in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. They have not shown any improvement or any signs of sustained improvement since Lawrence Stroll took it over. There appears to be no direction in the factory aside from copying the other teams as much as possible. I am not lying when I say that they couldn’t improve the car because McLaren and Ferrari did not have their cars hoisted up on cranes, revealing the floors and other elements of the car. Aston Martin fought for Dan Fallows and he turned out to be less than useful beyond remembering what an RB18 looked like. He couldn’t help them develop the car, he had nothing to offer. \n\nAnd that’s before we even come to the problem of whose name is above the door and therefore has a seat by default. I cannot imagine any serious team having the owner’s son in a seat. He doesn’t help them score points. Even when the car is bad, it’s been Alonso who has been getting the lion share of the available points. Yet, you hear AMR employees waxing lyrical about how Stroll helps develop the car with his great feedback - one problem with that…*there has been no signs of sustained improvement since the start of 2023*. For someone like Verstappen that would be an incredibly difficult situation to manage. \n\nNot to mention that there have been stories about AMR thanking their drivers for not being ‘too critical’ about the situation they’re in. Verstappen would have been putting them on blast every single week. Look at what he did to Red Bull when the engine kept failing a couple of seasons ago? Look at the fuss he kicked up about not having the fastest car anymore? Do people really honestly believe that this is a driver who would happily take up a seat at a team that had shown next to no ability to improve? \n\nAs for Newey, I am not convinced he would be able to fix this team. It might be a step too far for a man whose influence was allegedly waning at Red Bull. Clearly the one man they should have all been fighting for was Marshall. \n\nI cannot see anyone out of the Verstappen/Leclerc/Russell/Norris ‘generation’ ever moving to Aston Martin because there is no evidence at all that it’s a team moving in the right direction to be able to attract those incredibly ambitious and in some cases extremely vocal drivers.']",0,88,0.38,0,82,82,0,7,0.020000000000000018,0
