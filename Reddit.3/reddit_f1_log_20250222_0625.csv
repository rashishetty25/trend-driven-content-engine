The following cars fascinate me…\n\n1990 Lola/Larrousse - This car led the midfield at a good number of races from the French GP, though you could debate this depending on your definition of ‘midfield’. Either way, it was very competitive while being driven by Aguri Suzuki and Eric Bernard, who appeared evenly matched. Suzuki went on to make the ghost of Michele Alboreto look very good in 1992, which makes me wonder what a proven quality driver could have achieved in the 1990 Lola.\n\n1991 Jordan - This is obviously a widely celebrated car, but something that caught my eye when watching the 1990 season is how much Andrea de Cesaris struggled compared to Emmanuele Pirro. Was de Cesaris revitalised by this car, or was the car’s potential unfulfilled by a mediocre driver line-up?\n\n1995 Simtek - Jos Verstappen had this car running genuinely in the midfield for a good chunk of the time it was on circuit. It was incredible that this team produced this car while their existence was in such a precarious state. This was a world away from the car that was battling to make the grid the year prior.\n\n1997 Jordan - Like the 91 Jordan, this car is often highly praised, but I suspect even those who praise it might not realise how good it truly was. Ralf Schumacher and Giancarlo Fisichella were both defacto rookies, and even at their best were good but hardly world beaters. Their three podiums (and a fourth that got away at Hockenheim) look nice, and they were clearly best at power-dependent circuits, but they qualified this car in the top five at circuits like Imola, Monaco, Magny-Cours, Silverstone and the Nurburgring, so this car could clearly deliver results anywhere and the drivers were simply inconsistent.\n\n1997 Sauber - You only need to take a look at Johnny Herbert in the 1995 Benetton to see the 97 Sauber was a remarkably quick car, though the customer Ferrari engine clearly lacked power. Herbert had a podium at the Hungaroring and five other points finishes, four of those well inside the points. He was in the hunt for a podium when he broke down at Silverstone, was taken out after a great qualifying and a fantastic start in Melbourne, ran well in the points at Imola before breaking down and at Monaco before crashing in the rain. Herbert had arguably his best year, but given Schumacher had absolutely walloped him two years prior and that Frentzen had beaten him very convincingly in 96, you have to believe this would’ve looked a great car in their hands.\n\n2000 Arrows - This car was an absolute straight line rocketship. In Austria, Pedro de la Rosa legitimately ran ahead of Rubens Barrichello’s Ferrari and had made it to the one-stop pit window before breaking down. Granted, the Ferrari may have been a few laps heavier on fuel, but that was still outstanding for this team at this time. De la Rosa then ran towards the front all race before rain fell at Hockenheim, while Jos Verstappen was within a few seconds of beating Ralf to a podium at an admittedly attrition-heavy race at Monza. De la Rosa’s performance at the Nurburgring and Verstappen’s in Canada would indicate this was also a good car in the wet.\n\n2000 Minardi - This was no ordinary backmarker Minardi. This car was over 0.4% closer to pole position than the 1999 car and 0.8% closer than the 2001 car. Like the Arrows, it quite clearly excelled on low downforce circuits. Marc Gene had it on the fringes of points contention prior to late pit stops in Austria and was easily holding onto the midfield at Hockenheim. There were few other race day highlights, but this car makes you wonder what Alonso could’ve done with an extra 0.8% of pace the following year.', '5 days left until testing', ""The new episode of bring back V10s with Edd Straw and Matt Bishop is the highest tier of esoteric dorkage.

First of all, I'd say that I totally agree that it would be insane to try to ban, penalize or fine drivers for swearing on team radio. Most people end up swearing if they get cut off driving in the city, I can't imagine what I would even say if I crash at 300km/h or even just get a bad strategy that makes me lose positions.

That being said, everything I've seen so far about the swearing, that's actually coming from the rules or the FIA, has been about the use of language OFF the race track, in media and press. Isn't this pretty standard for every single other sport in the world? Or profession for that matter, I wouldn't expect anyone in a press conference to just casually start swearing, just like I wouldn't expect reporters to be like ""Hey Max, that was a pretty fucked up lap wasn't it?"". Have I missed anything where they have actually said that they will crack down on swearing on the track??

The only thing related that I have seen, has been the media leaks that there might be thought of no longer allowing for team radio to be broadcasted, which would definitely suck, but at the same time, I guess there's a reason most other sports don't have mics on all their player during broadcast.

Like I say, I'm genuinely trying to understand where all the backlash comes from","['I mean, fines are one thing, even community service I’m still like, okay I can live with it. I’m not happy, but I can see where they are coming from. \n\nBut threatening points deduction or bans is so batshit insane to me. That is so disproportionate to the actual rules violation it’s not even funny', ""It was always a non-issue.\n\nDrivers rarely if ever swear outside the car, all the exorbitant fines and other punishments over the past season have done is put all the focus on something that's fucking irrelevant. There is no reason for these draconic punishments to exists except for MBS throwing his weight around to show how much power he has and *that* is what people are pissed off about."", ""The backlash comes from the way they handled it and the way MBS is using this as a powermove to show that he is the boss. \n\nI pretty much never swear, so I'm not that invested in this. But a driver potentially losing the championship for using a word in their second or third language, when FOM are the ones who decide to air it and not bleep it? It seems pretty disingenuous."", ""Firstly MBS has intimated that the band extends to team radio, and even if that wasn't expected to be the case, you're expecting drivers who've just been on track for an hour and a half to immediately switch off the adrenaline running around their system, it's not like every other word out their mouth is a four letter word, (well maybe Yuki) but mistakes will get made"", 'my main issue with the ban is that the FIA should have no right to regulate what goes on TV and what doesn\'t\n\nFOM are the commercial rights holders, they\'re the ones who should be concerned with negotiating the kind of language they and the broadcasters want the public to see, the FIA is just supposed to handle the sporting and technical side of things.\n\nMBS also threatened to ban team radio broadcasts if they don\'t comply with the swearing regulations, which is WAY out of line an insane overreach from the FIA\'s role in the sport\n\nif FOM hasn\'t felt that swearing devalues the sport or creates issues with the broadcasters and the general public, there\'s no reason why the FIA should step out of their line to ban it, especially not with such a racist reasoning as ""they\'re F1 drivers, not rappers""', 'The swearing and attitudes to expletives is one discussion. \n\nThe other is how wide ranging the rules are. They don’t just cover what the FIA might consider to be naughty words, they effectively cover anything that the FIA might possibly consider that they don’t like and quite a long time after it happened. \n\nWhen an organisation that is actively shrugging off checks and balances enacts a rule that gives it authority to punish for just about anything if they decide they don’t care for it, it should raise some alarm bells.', 'Another issue I have is where does the money from the fines go? Like it’s one thing if it went to a charity but from I’ve seen it just goes back into the FIA', 'Cause a brown Muslim is pushing for it and it upsets the racists', ""it's never been an issue, why are they bringing in rules to deal with it in such a hamfisted way?\n\nany press conference can be bleeped out with a delay, the normal live broadcasts will just apologise like they are meant it and not a problem, the radio can also be delayed with swearing bleeped if they MUST do something.\n\n  \nit's just Ben being a small little man with a huge ego and wealth, trying to use unnecessary power."", '> That being said, everything I\'ve seen so far about the swearing, that\'s actually coming from the rules or the FIA, has been about the use of language OFF the race track, in media and press.  \n  \nThe issue is the vagueness of the rules, as the penalties are applicable in 4 areas, from: https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/appendix_b_-_stewards_penalty_guidelines.pdf  \n& https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/2025_international_sporting_code_fr-en_marked-up_version_27.01.2025.pdf  \n  \nAs they only specify The Event and any competition (Article 12.2 and not any specific FIA events (well, what isn\'t a FIA event? Every time they\'re in Practice or qualifying or race is per definition a FIA regulated event like FIA press conference).  \n  \nThe main protection is stewards discretion:  \n  \n> Stewards retain the discretion to take into account\nany mitigating and/or aggravating circumstances as well as the nature and location of the Event, to tailor the\npenalty to the specific situation.  \n  \nNow imagine a driver receiving a penalty that they\'re not happy about during the race and isn\'t that polite about a specific steward in his radio message to the team (and listened in on by FIA). What keeps them from just applying it under the following clause:\n  \n> * 12.2.1.f ISC: Any words, deeds or writings that have caused moral injury or loss to the FIA, its bodies, its members or its executive officers, and more generally on the interest of motor sport and on the values defended by the FIA.  \n  \nAny words (swearing) - have caused moral injury (specific type of swearing, like insulating a stewards mother is a female dog) - its members (the steward) - the values defended by the FIA (we don\'t like swearing group).  \n  \nIt\'s like the vague decades-long definition of ""Any cars..."" that stayed in the sporting regulations over decades until someone applied a creative interpretation to this, which caused an uproar.  \n  \nOther rules like:  \n  \n> * 12.2.1.l Any Misconduct. \n> * 12.2.1.n Any public incitement to violence or hatred. \n  \nThose are not really related to an event, say - someone does a combination, by wearing a T-shirt saying ""Hunt Put(a)in"" in the paddock.  \n  \nThis would directly be in violation of clause n, which is a misconduct triggering clause l and possibly clause p, if said person decides to wear it on a podium.  \n  \n> 12.2.1.p Failure to comply with the instructions of the FIA regarding the appointment and participation of persons during official ceremonies at any Competition counting towards a FIA Championship  \n  \nAs they\'re only allowed to wear team overalls on the podium.\n  \nThe only thing we have now is the WRC driver being penalized, which contained additional elaborations:  \n  \n> but also verbal/physical abuse, and making/displaying political, religious and personal statements or comments notably in violation of the general principle of neutrality promoted by the FIA under its Statutes.  \n  \nImagine if someone prays or kisses a cross on a podium, over saying ""i fucked up in that corner"" in a media pen interview, which maybe isn\'t broadcast to every sender and just gets translated to Romanian by the Interviewer']",0,57,0.21,0,140,140,0,0,0.01999999999999999,0
