The FIA, aware that this step would have resulted in an unbearable increase in costs under the Budget Cap regime, granted confidence to the teams, allowing them to intervene on the cars freely. It is possible, therefore, that from the next tests scheduled after the Hungarian GP in Budapest it will be possible to see the first experimental solutions. On the Hungarian track Alpine, McLaren and Racing Bulls will be on stage on Tuesday, while the next day alongside the Enstone team will be only Haas.

1m2yu8x,F1 career as Aerospace Undergrad,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m2yu8x/f1_career_as_aerospace_undergrad/,2025-07-18, Discussion,"Hi all! I am facing a bit of a conundrum about my future. For context: I am a (going into in September) third year Aerospace student at Bristol university and want to work in F1 as an aerodynamicist or something similar - technical side. Currently I am on track for a 1st class degree and am on the bachelors course (3 years).

I have not had any experience in F1 but am shadowing a GT3 team race weekend and have done a 7 week research internship which involved wind tunnels and aeroelastic testing this summer. I am part of my university's equivalent to formula student and will be aerodynamics lead next year.  I am also press manager for my university's FS AI team although I don't really do much technical stuff and regularly volunteer/participate in engineering outreach activities. My third year individual project is going to be F1 related. 

1) Do I ask to change course to 4 years and apply for F1 placements between my 3 and 4 years? I do not really like the idea of staying in the same city for so long and don't want to feel too comfortable if that makes sense. 

2) Do I apply for grad roles off the bat with no F1 experience?

3) Do I apply for MSc Advanced Computational Methods at Imperial to bolster CV? I really like all the modules listed for this course and want to live in London for a year of my life 

I'm currently thinking of applying for grad roles and the MSc and just doing 3 years at Bristol but this summer in the engineering department has really made me love the uni and made my decision harder.

Any input would be appreciated! Be as harsh and realistic as you want!

Thanks","['The book ""How to win a Grand Prix"" by Bernie Collins has an interesting section on the recruitment process for graduates - for that one team at least. \n\nOthers have said this, but get a masters, and follow your dream. However, don\'t be disheartened if you miss out on a graduate role - it is incredibly competitive. There\'s a lot of aerospace in the UK where those qualifications will be valued and there will always be roles that you can apply for in the future. F1 teams don\'t just recruit from other F1 teams. \n\n\nIgnore the naysayers - you\'re doing aerospace engineering at university in the UK whilst getting involved in other Motorsport. You couldn\'t be in a better position to make it happen.', ""1 - Placements can be incredible, for the life and professional experience they can give you., plus a good way of making sure that F1/Engineering is really what you want to do.  They are hotly contested though so have a plan for other sectors / companies you think you'd also get a lot of learning from.  \nThat said, not everyone working in F1 did a placement year!  \n  \nIt may be a bit late now, but if you're comfortable with cold messaging people on LinkedIn, work your way through the Aero Departments and ask if they would be willing to provide support for your Final Year Project, or if there's a final year project you could do which would feedback into that team. (It does happen!).\n\n2 - Grad Roles are just what they say they are, roles for graduates - you can't ask people for multiple years of F1 XP when they are of standard university leavers age.  There are people who work in F1 who never had any intention of working in it, but they had the right skills to fit the job.  As a grad no one would be expecting you to know **everything** and they won't be measuring you against people who have been there for years.\n\n3 - You could stick to your current BEng course, nail your First, and apply for paid internships at engineering companies.  Do one of those for a year / set number of months, and then move into an MSc of your choosing, potentially with a better idea of what you would like to specialise in. \n\n  \nFormula Student is not a deal-breaker for F1 teams - it's now such a commonly held activity that it doesn't make candidates standout any more - you know yourself, but ensure that if you end up in FS full time that you'll still have the capacity to ace your exams and final year project.  Your final degree mark will mean more than your time in FS from an academic POV (social time in FS is top tier!)."", 'I\'ll just answer the part for grad roles: Yes, no F1 experience is required to get into the grad roles, that\'s what they are for! Obviously, having motorsport experience or any experience from your Uni that shows that you are really invested into motorsports (and good enough at that) would still be what interviewers are looking for and improve your chances of getting in.\n\nIf you\'re dead set to get into F1, applying for the placement program is imo the best way to bolster your chances. For one, gives you an idea of if you really want to be doing this (a guy I know swore off the idea of doing it after uni after their placement), and if you prove to be someone they like they\'ll ""reserve"" you for when you graduate.', ""Bristol Uni graduate and current F1 engineer here, glad you're enjoying Bristol so much!\n\nA masters degree is very helpful, especially if you can get something specific and relevant for your final year project. Having a larger scale project to talk about and be questioned on during interviews is valuable. \n\nIf you can manage a placement with a team as well, it is likely they will be able and willing to support your final year project with a topic and/or feedback.\n(assuming you didn't do horribly in the placement of course!)\n\nApplying off the bat will put you in direct competition with people who may already have masters degrees, be returning from placements or trying to come in from other industries. That's will always be the case whenever you apply but be aware you could be on the back foot.\n\nAnother option you could consider is applying to F1-adjacent companies in the same area as your interested in. Tier 1 suppliers, other categories etc. The one thing that always trumps a qualified graduate, is a qualified graduate with industry experience."", ""Building your CV for motorsport takes some preparation. It isn't too late. As far as Formula Student goes, I think it depends upon how active you are. There are those who play significant roles and seem to live/sleep/breathe FS. Great if you can do that and sail through your exams but there's another way to make your CV standout: volunteer as a race marshall at the local circuit. My son did one day a month for a year at Castle Combe and I am convinced that was what helped him get a week at Williams as a sixth form student and then the gap year at Mercedes during his Motorsport Engineering degree. Having some relevant volunteering experience shows real commitment and the teams really do respect the work of race marshalls; the orange army. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it as a means of differentiating yourself from the crowd. I believe that the undergrad placements are advertised August to October so make sure that you're looking early enough. They aren't open for long."", 'Go into aircraft instead and make some money, instead of chasing a hobby for peanuts.', ""It's not that complicated. Don't focus purely on F1 or motorsport, just do what you can to be a great aerodynamicist. What your degree says doesn't matter a whole lot. Where you did it also doesn't matter a whole lot. Apply to whatever sort of aero jobs you can find and get involved with formula student and build up your skillset. It's relatively easy to get at least a call back for an F1 placement these days *if* they look at your CV, and if you've got some aero experience of some form on it. They get so many applications that a lot of teams won't even bother looking at every application they get. At the end of the day what's going to be make or break is how well you understand the subject material. Everything else is secondary. It's a little different if you're trying to be a race engineer or something....\n\n\nAlso consider *other* aerodynamics positions as well.

I’m a professor of Control Engineering, and I happen to know Prof. Smith.

For those who do not know, Prof. Smith is the inventor of the inerter, a suspension device that had a huge impact on Formula 1 in the last 20 years. After its invention, the inerter was secretly used by McLaren since the Spanish Grand Prix in 2005. If you check the results of that year, the impact is quite astonishing. Renault won all the previous 4 Grands Prix. Once the inerter was deployed, McLaren went on to win 10 of the following 15 Grands Prix.

But the inerter became famous only a couple of years after as the mysterious “J-damper” during the 2007 F1 Spygate. Only in 2008, journalist Craig Scarborough revealed that the J-damper was in fact a device called “inerter”, invented by Prof. Smith at the University of Cambridge.

I had the opportunity of interviewing Prof. Smith and go deep into the story of the inerter and his involvement in Formula 1: from a chance call from Williams F1, all the way to the 2022 ban.

The interview is a goldmine of information, some of which is quite technical, while some is more big-picture moments about F1 engineering, innovation, and industrial espionage.

As the r/formula1 is a varied crowd, below I’ve timestamped the Formula 1 bits if you just want the racing side of the story, without the technical explanation. If instead you are into F1 tech and you want to know how he came up with such an idea, what an inerter does, and how it’s different from a tuned mass damper, then watch the whole thing!

I’m happy to answer to some questions below.

Or should the racing director be left to decide? It seems as though there have been times when even drivers do not want to participate in the race and have to risk their lives to keep their jobs.

1m2x9q7,"What are general opinions on ""sister-teams"", and could F1 realistically get rid of them?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m2x9q7/what_are_general_opinions_on_sisterteams_and/,2025-07-18, Discussion,"Hey, new fan here (started following the sport this season). I always thought it was pretty weird that Red Bull through VCARB essentially have 4 seats in the sport, 2 of which are essentially used as backups for the main team (even though their car seems to be better than the main one this year lol). It seems that some of the other teams do this too to a much lesser extend (Williams for Merc, Haas for Ferrari), with those cases are more of a business partnership rather than straight up owning two teams. I don't really get why teams are able to do this (apart from $$$), because I think that inherently makes F1 less competitive, but I want to know other people's opinions on this. Are there any benefits to having ""sister teams"" or ""development teams"" or whatever you want to call them, and do you think there are ways that they could be removed?","['It was a one off situation\n\nRed Bull came in and saved a team that went bankrupt at the request of F1. Other teams also had the chance but didn’t do it.\n\nI don’t think a team would be allowed to buy another team today\n\nWhen someone does you a favor when you are having a tough time it would be bad if you then tried to reverse it when times are good', ""The only way to remove them is force Red Bull to sell the team which I don't think would ever go through legally. \n\n\nThey have that team since 2006 where Minardi otherwise would have gone bankrupt and out of the sport without anyone else really trying to own them. \n\nSo basically they saved a team from going bankrupt at a time F1 wasn't lucrative as it is now. Teams spent way more and teams dropped out quickly in the following years because of the economic crisis aswell."", 'People have answered your question, but the short answer is that F1 would have been less competitive if Red Bull had not saved Minardi (which after a few name changes became Visa Cash App Racing Bulls F1 Team).\n\nKeep in mind that the team has used Ferrari, Renault, and Honda engines.', 'Outside of VCARB, the others are customers of the engine manufacturers. Having customer teams has always been part of F1 and if every team had to manufacture their own PU, we would not have a lot of the long running teams because the cost and resource to set that up and maintain it is unrealistic. So ya, sometimes there are rookies that go to midfield teams because of team connections, but I don’t really see an issue with it tbh. All the drivers and teams are connected in some way because of how personnel moved around the grid, so it’s always going to have an element of who you know which will help someone land a seat. VCARB is a different story entirely. Minardi needed a buyer, Red Bull came in, it’s been rebranded quite a few times since 2006. Ya, it’s strange for them to be the only sister team on the grid but.. it doesn’t bug me that much or really ever', 'It doesn’t really bother me personally, Redbull also took on a risk to buy a failing team. There were other teams at the time that could have bought the team and done the same thing, but didn’t.\n\nI think people generally make a much bigger deal of it than it is. Plus with how far ahead the top teams are anyway it give a bit more to watch, especially since the VCARB drivers are generally rookies or at least on the young side and I always like seeing how the rookies do.', ""The last team that illegally cooperated with their partner team was Racing Point, now Aston Martin in 2020. \n\nWhile people being angry, Toro Rosso has never been proven (or even officially accused by the FIA) to collude with RBR outside of the legal limits. \n\nRBR decides Toro Rosso's driver lineups, but that is hardly unique. Till 2022 Ferrari had direct control over one Haas and one Sauber seat, cheapening the engine and giving them access to further parts such as gearbox and suspensions, as these listed parts are allowed to be traded. It's perfectly fine within the regs and even intended, else most young driver programs could close shop."", "">I don't really get why teams are able to do this (apart from $$$), because I think that inherently makes F1 less competitive\n\nPre-budget cap Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes were spending over $400 million. Then you had McLaren and Renault spending between $250-300 million. That left Racing Point, AlphaTauri, Williams, Haas, and Sauber with budgets between $130-190 million.\n\nWithout technical partnerships - like the ones between Williams and Mercedes, and Haas with Ferrari - these teams would have been even less competitive. It gave them access to parts and tech they had zero scope of developing themselves, and allowed them to prioritize developing areas of the car that had to be created independently.\n\nEven now in the cost cap era, the facilities at each team's disposal can differ wildly. Vowles pushed to allow exemptions within the cost cap for special projects like building new wind tunnels and simulators, so Williams could upgrade their woefully out of date systems and facilities.\n\nAs for drivers, some of the midfield teams do take on development drivers from their technical partners, but I think that is becoming less of the case as they all have their own junior programs now. Williams haven't had a Mercedes driver since Russell. Latifi and Sargeant were both Williams juniors and they even retained Sargeant over Schumacher who Toto Wolff was lobbying for them to take on."", 'I love it when people bring that up. Red Bull saved us from only having 9 teams on the grid back in 2006 when nobody wanted Minardi and they were bankrupt. Now that F1 is popular again and the teams actually make money some people have a problem with it. In their minds they were basically only allowed to dump money in the team but not benefit now.', 'I totally understand your points and I don\'t wanna offer any solution for this since there are always going to be some dependences from some teams to other (like Williams to Merc because they use the engines, friendship/former employment like toto and vowels, or Haas total concept as a team to keep costs low)\n\n\n\nBut I wanna give some context to why the RedBull and Vcarb/Toro Rosso/alpha Tauri situation. Before the budget cap (and Netflix hype) there was a time when not many people would own a team since it was so expensive, and if you were a Midfield or Backmarker team you\'ll still loose tons of money and probably never have a realistic chance at a win. That lead for example lead to the famous 1 dollar sell of Jaguar to Red Bull. When Minardi was struggling Dietmar Mateschitz (owner of Red Bull) decided to buy it aswell since there wasn\'t that much interest from others. Of course Red Bull profits a lot from it, but also the other teams benefit from having a ""junior"" team on the grid if you for example of how many drivers in other teams are former red bull drivers.', ""Where do you draw the line between a shared ownership, with individual IP development and a team like Haas that buys as much as they're legally allowed from Ferrari - all while giving a ride to Ferrari juniors?  \nThe same thing could have been said about Williams before the dorliton buyout and their connection to Mercedes and a healthy discount they got on their PU.  \n  \nAnd on the other hand similar beneficial partnerships also didn't help Manor and the 2 other failed teams who entered in 2010 - meaning all 3 went broke, due to financial instability (which Red Bull guarantees to CashGrab).""]",0,71,0.29,0,289,289,0,1,-0.030000000000000027,0
