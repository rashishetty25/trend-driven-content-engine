Either not over Webber losing it 15 freaking years ago, or some other random shit. I sincerely hope this championship goes down the line with both drivers trying their best to win it. That's how it should be... And being shitty towards a driver who just dominated entire field is telling more on them than on the driver in question.\n\nIf Oscar pulled this gap yall would be memeing and cyberbullying Norris all day long. But somehow now it's just Oscar being unlucky with yellow flags? Maybe he should have been faster in first attempt then, no?\n\nDisclaimer before some weirdo tries this card: I ain't British and I like Oscar enough to the point that I'd be perfectly fine with him winning it. He reminds me of Kimi Raikkonen during his peak a lot... And that's a praise in my books. But this bullshit is so tiresome. If you want Oscar to just win without a fight just buy F1 game, set difficulty to 10 and win it for your own feelings and stop bothering the rest of us who actually enjoy competition with your shitty takes that are just parroting random memes you've seen on Instagram.""]",280,96,0.87,280,81,81,41,23,0.0,41
