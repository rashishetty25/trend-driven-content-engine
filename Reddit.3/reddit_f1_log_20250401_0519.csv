The only reason the undercut drama happened in Hungary was because he made a mistake that put him in undercut territory the first place. He then got dropped rapidly by Norris. Zandvoort and Singapore should have been easy second places at worst but he didn't get them. He couldn't win Monza after preventing his teammate from doing so by making him back out so they didn't both crash out. Given the pace Norris had, Baku should have been a comfortable win. But he couldn't drop Leclerc and needed his teammate to hold up Perez to get a win at all. In Austria he wasn't there to inherit the win, instead letting Russell have it despite a much inferior car. He had no pace in Vegas. He was unlucky to be spun by Verstappen in Abu Dhabi, but the ensuing recovery drive was messy, including a downright amateurish mistake in driving into the back of Colapinto. This is by no means extensive. This reputation he has as cool and calm comes entirely from his somewhat monotone voice and demeanour. He has, on several occasions such as Abu Dhabi, shown that he is far from unflappable.\n\nSpa was one of the few times last year he was outright better than Norris. But even there, Norris, having one of his worst races of the year, was 8.7 seconds behind him at the finish line. That's much closer than Piastri gets to Norris when he has an off weekend. Australia won't be the only time this year there's a massive gap between the two of them and the gap will be in Norris's favour every time or very close to it.""]",457,89,0.98,457,84,84,154,19,0.010000000000000009,154
