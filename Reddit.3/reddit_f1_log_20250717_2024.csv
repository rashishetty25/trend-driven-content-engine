They have coverage of F1, MotoGP, Indy, Formula E and WEC and podcasts for all of them as well (apart from WEC I think).', 'For WEC specifically sportscar365 and onlyendurance are great sites.', 'I don\'t go out of my way to find F1 news. All the social medias and googles knows I like F1 so they show me F1 content. For the most part I end up hiding that content because it\'s junk news with click bait titles. \n\nAll I really care about is watching the race. I don\'t care about the politics going on, I don\'t care about following the drivers off track. Pretty much anything I could want to know is covered in the pre race build up. I don\'t even stick around for the post race coverage. \n\nI do like watching more technical breakdowns on YouTube but the ""news"" coverage of F1 is too sensationalised for the most part.', 'Similar situation as you. I really like The Race.\n\n(Also, Radio LeMans has podcast replays of WEC races, if that scratches a particular itch for you.)', 'P1 with Matt and Tommy are excellent for car rides. It’s a YouTube channel.']",0,35,0.41,0,31,31,0,6,0.08999999999999997,0
