1jpquoo,[AMuS] Does Cadillac have a wind tunnel advantage?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1jpquoo/amus_does_cadillac_have_a_wind_tunnel_advantage/,2025-04-02, News,,"['Translation and full article:\n\n\n> Cadillac has been an official member of the 2026 Formula 1 field since March 7. The US racing team now has eleven months to assemble a team and a car. Does Cadillac benefit from a wind tunnel advantage?\n\n> This Formula 1 project has never had an easy time. What began with Andretti Global\'s application in February 2023 took two years to final approval. During that time, the applicant vacillated between hope and fear. At the beginning of 2024, Formula 1 management mockingly recommended that Andretti try again in 2028.\n\n> By then, the company had already been declared a General Motors factory under the Cadillac flag. But it took Andretti\'s complaint to the U.S. Congress alleging antitrust violations that broke the ice. A face-saving compromise was reached. Suddenly, everyone was thrilled with General Motors\' commitment to Formula 1. On March 7, the FIA \u200b\u200bgave its final blessing.\n\n> The two years underground were not wasted. Since the fall of 2023, an ever-growing group of engineers, model builders, financial experts, and managers have been doing preparatory work for a team and a car scheduled to debut in 2026. For a long time, it was a journey to nowhere, as board member Mario Andretti explains: ""As long as we didn\'t have the commitment, we were only driven by the belief that everything would turn out well. Now everyone knows they\'re working on something that will be on the starting grid in 2026.""\n\n> Audi as a competitor on the labor market. The Cadillac Formula 1 team is spread across four locations. Its headquarters are in Fishers near Indianapolis, where a state-of-the-art race factory is currently being built. At the European branch in Silverstone, engineers are developing the American automaker\'s first Formula 1 car. Their wind tunnel is located at Toyota in Cologne. General Motors\' engine division is located in Charlotte, where it plans to eventually design and build its own Formula 1 engine.\n\n> Since its registration, Cadillac has been subject to the budget cap and all the regulations of the 2026 regulations. Now the rookies also have to pay their $450 million entry fee. One team member says: ""If there\'s no problem anywhere, it\'s with money. We\'re well financed."" The two major investors, Mark Walter and Dan Towriss, are absolute heavyweights with their companies.\n\n> Currently, around 300 people are working on building the team and developing the 2026 car. By the end of the year, the workforce is expected to grow to 650 employees. In theory, Cadillac has a good chance of recruiting new talent. They have plenty of open positions and room for improvement in their budget. But now, with Audi, they suddenly have a competitor on the English job market. The Ingolstadt-based company has opened a technology center just around the corner in Bicester.\n\n> Job advertisements only since the beginning of March. Cadillac\'s technical advisor Pat Symonds warns against underestimating the growth process: ""We were only able to issue detailed job advertisements once our approval was secured at the beginning of March. Before that, we had asked the non-binding question in the advertisements: Would you like to participate in an exciting project?""\n\n> Employees Cadillac recruits from other teams now can\'t start work immediately. Most are on leave until the end of the year. This means they won\'t be available until the next car. The newcomer also doesn\'t have unlimited flexibility within the budget cap. It all depends on how much you want to build yourself or outsource.\n\n> The plan is for Cadillac to do as much as possible itself. But that requires production facilities, know-how, and people. All of this is a time constraint. Unlike Audi, the Americans are essentially starting from scratch. Audi at least found a functioning infrastructure and a well-coordinated team at Sauber in Hinwil. And yet, Formula 1 boss Mattia Binotto has respect for the task: ""The transformation into a top team doesn\'t happen overnight. It takes up to five years.""\n\n> Building the car and integrating new employees is one thing. At least equally challenging are seemingly simple tasks such as logistics, establishing an IT department and a supplier network, liaising between development and production, and purchasing trucks and a motorhome. Cadillac essentially didn\'t get the ball rolling on these until the second week of March.\n\n(1/2)', 'Toyota F1 had the largest budget and most technologically advanced wind tunnel at the time. They ended up 0 wins, 3 poles, and 13 podiums in 140 starts.', ""They have an advantage, sure, but it doesn't automatically translate to performance."", ""They're going to be 11th, they have some advantages sure but it's of little benefit when they're drastically disadvantaged in other areas."", 'Did Haas when they had unlimited development before they joined?', 'Interesting they are not buying mechanical components like suspension from Ferrari. I would think they would buy as most as possible so they can build out the most needed team like aero and gradually build out the rest of the team. \n\nWhile it is a different regulation, I still think actual track time with current team is better than the wind tunnel advantage. Cadillac has very limited correlation data for now.', 'From what I am reading, it is most likely hearsay until we get more concrete information about their wind tunnel advantage. It is hard to calculate a result when nothing much has been properly tested just yet', '""Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no.""\nI have an inkling that applies here.', 'Maybe but they have a disadvantage of not being on the grid and having that experience.

Hill, Alesi, Hakkinen and Barrichello had high highs, but also some low lows.\n\n1997 - Probably Villeneuve just over Coulthard, the latter being the only candidate (except possibly Salo) who didn’t have a down year.\n\n1998 - Hakkinen\n\n1999 - Frentzen\n\n2000 - I think Hakkinen but can’t argue against Frentzen, who very much backed up what he did the prior year. \n\n2001 - Probably Trulli, but like 97, this is another year where convincing cases are hard to come by.\n\n2002 - Barrichello', 'Say we went back to 1950 number of races and you could only pick 6 races on the current calendar to make up the whole season which six would you choose?\xa0', 'Still waiting for Charles to drop his single after both Ferrari DSQ.
