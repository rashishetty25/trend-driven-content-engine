Leclerc’s qualifying pace, which was exceptionally strong early on in his career and is still excellent, was also bolstered when he could rely on the car to settle.

Those who want everything immediately, and don't understand how F1 works, consider his difficulties with a car that's too inconsistent in its behavior as a consequence of the decline of a former champion. But what the Englishman has been preaching for a while – since he assessed the situation at Maranello – is a change of philosophy, a less extreme future project, with a good aerodynamic base capable of making life easier for the drivers, who are not lacking in talent. This would be as essential as bread for Leclerc too, who through frustrations and suffering has come to humiliate himself (Saturday after qualifying)\n\nDont think this is an unreasonable take, Lewis has been talking for weeks now how theres a lot of things that need to change at Ferrari to become championship contenders,  that they need to have a solid foundation and that hes working with fred to see that happen.

Since bearman was the overtaking driver, it is my opinion he did not overtake safely, yes Yuki did not have control over the car, but that's always a risk when you overtake on the outside especially in the rain (Ham vs Alb Red bull ring anyone? And that was dry)

I think the stewards were way too harsh, this is either a racing incident or ~~stop and go / pitlane drive~~ 5s penalty or black & white flag at best.

I watched the footage 6 times.. :/","[""> stop and go / pitlane drive penalty at best.\n\n\nMaybe I’m misunderstanding what you're saying here, but this is one of the harshest penalties they could hand out.

I'm not too sure what the exact expected course of action is here, but I feel like the stewards expected Tsunoda to immediately concede the corner if he cannot be in control.

1ltwsx8,Should the F1 rain light stay on constantly in heavy spray instead of blinking?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ltwsx8/should_the_f1_rain_light_stay_on_constantly_in/,2025-07-07, Discussion,"During the British GP, Hadjar crashed into Antonelli in extremely poor visibility. Afterward, he said he only saw the red rear light at the last moment—too late to react.

**That made me wonder: why do F1 rain lights still blink during heavy spray?**

In light rain, blinking might help grab attention. But in dense spray, the off-moments make the car ahead briefly invisible, which is exactly when you need to see it. A solid, constantly lit rain light would likely be more visible through the mist, even if less “attention-grabbing” on paper.

According to older threads and technical docs, the rain light flashes at ~4Hz in wet conditions and ~2Hz during ERS harvesting, but a solid mode does exist (like during pit limiter). Why not use it when visibility is at its worst?

With wet races becoming more common, shouldn't the FIA consider making the rain light stay on instead of flashing in extreme spray?","[""A blinking or strobing light demands your attention, a single continuous light would eventually start being ignored because it's there constantly. It's why every emergency vehicle has strobing lights."", 'Having two lights side by side in each of the three ""points"" of the triangle, that flash on and off alternately, would possibly help.\n\nThat way there\'s a light visible all of the time, but the flashing makes the light move to still draw attention to it.', ""I've raced in rain worse than this weekend. You can't see any of the lights whether they're blinking, solid or anything. When it's that bad you have no choice but to drive as if you're all running race pace. If someone spins or slows down dramatically you are hitting them 100% of the time. Nothing you can do about it. That's why race directors stop races or pull out the safety car. If you can't stop in half the distance you can see ahead to be clear, it is not safe to race.\n\nTLDR, it doesn't matter in the slightest. By the time you see the light you are incapable of stopping."", 'That light was off more than it was on. It needs to blink way more frequently than it does.', 'Id like them to use those blue tyres now and again bit I think blinking is easier to notice than it being on all the time', ""When you have zero visibility it doesn't matter if the light is solid or blinking, you can't see anything."", 'On Missed Apex they were talking about giving drivers an infrared HUD.

That makes total sense in general visibility conditions. But I still feel like dense spray during wet races is a different beast entirely.\n\nWhen you have 0.5 seconds to react and the light is ""off"" during the one moment you need it — that’s when the blinking works against you. It’s not about visibility over time, it’s about instant detection through walls of water spray.\n\nThat said, I really liked the hybrid suggestions people brought up:\n\n* Split array – top half always on, bottom half blinks (u/laluneodyssee)\n* Alternating lights – multiple LEDs flashing in sequence so there\'s always one lit (u/gazchap)\n* Blinking on straights, solid under braking (u/Broala__)\n* Some LEDs blinking, others solid – similar to some road car configs (u/Zinthar)\n* Visibility might still be zero regardless – fair point from u/vacon04\n* Past version may have had constant+brighter strobe – noted by u/_salmonellensittich\n\nSeems like there’s room for innovation here without abandoning the core principle of attention-grabbing light behavior.\n\nWould be interesting to know if FIA ever tested any of these setups, or why they switched from earlier solid-light configs (as some mentioned).']",19,45,0.63,19,40,40,0,0,-0.020000000000000018,0

He’s very lucky none of them actually crashed.', 'r/f1technical is probably the better forum if you want better answers than ""he broke 2x as much.""\n\nEspecially considering the FIA in the Russell document didn\'t even comment on the brake pressure argument put forward by mercedes', ""I think both are important.\n\nYou can't just use stopping distance alone because the conditions mean that it is more difficult for cars behind to both see Oscar's braking and then stop in time. So even if he took longer in terms of distance to slow down that Russell did, it could provide more of a hazard."", 'So long as the tyre has grip I would assume they are the same.\n\nThe caliper acts on the brake disc and applies a braking force relative to the pressure on the pedal.\n\nThat will slow the wheel rotation down by the same ammount UNLESS the tyre loses grip and locks.\n\nNot a physiscist or engineer, but that is how my logic works on this.', 'G-force generated under breaking is the correct measurement.\n\n\nThe FIA could have easily fixed this issue of gaming restarts by writing rules that remove them as a competitive aspect of racing.', 'I don\'t think setting a limit on brake psi is useful, nor is it the intended purpose of the FIA. Stopping distance cannot be easily calculated from the psi. Also no one was stopping, they were braking within the limits of grip. \n\nThe vague point of erratic driving points to ""risk to the guy behind"" which in this case has a lot more to do with visibility. ""Max cannot see you because of the spray so this is not the time to throw up a surprise and brake harder than any other race leader has done behind the safety car in recent years.""\n\nThe Russell comparison is just to illustrate that last point: show what has caught out the number 2 man in the past even without the visibility issue.', 'Idk why anyone is looking at psi instead of Gs. Unless that data is not available.', 'Brakes in racing cars are different than in road cars, and braking is a different process too. The braking action can be very violent for max effectiveness. Typically, when a car needs to brake for a corner, the driver slams on the brakes quite hard and then gradually releases. That\'s kinda the opposite of what you (should) do in a road car.\n\nI can\'t find good data on how much psi F1 brakes do, but apparently it can be up to 2000 psi? So 30 or 60 really is not much, definitely not proper corner braking, more like gentle slowing down like in a road car.\n\nI guess that\'s why the McL people were saying it just looks more dramatic on TV due to how fast the cars are and how the brakes work.\n\nIn that context, Russell\'s 30 psi makes even more sense that he was just warming them up, even if it looked like hard braking to us.\n\nAs for the rain, I\'m not too sure but I\'d guess that\'s the same like in a road car. If you brake too hard, the guy behind you is more likely to ram you even if the overall braking distance is longer, so braking inherently carries more risk. I also imagine F1 drivers are more gentle on the brakes in the rain to keep better control, so maybe even 60 psi is into the ""don\'t do that"" territory in the rain.\n\nBut I\'ve also seen an explanation that the main difference between Russell\'s and Piastri\'s situation was that Russel was still behind an active SC with its lights on, while Piastri was essentially under racing conditions with him controlling the speed, not the SC. So it was his responsibility to not do anything that can be seen as erratic.\n\nNote: I\'m not an F1 driver', 'Just have to let the Brit win. \n\nHe literally got the same penalty Max got for banzaiing into another car on purpose.']",0,17,0.37,0,87,87,0,0,-0.020000000000000018,0

1. Mercedes - Even without verstappen merc look strong and with the new regs looking engine focused they may well be top of the field.

2. Aston Martin - Aston will unquestionable have the best chassis thanks to newey but honda look to be struggling slightly with the new regs although they are very good at making hybrid engines so may be pushing for title (alonso 3rd wdc???)

3. Ferrari - Will have a strong package like always, not having to switch to single turbo will give them slight advantage

4. Mclaren - Strong podium contender but given there extreme development to secure title this year it may be hard for them to compete for titles in coming years however the merc engine will work well for them

5. Williams - will be close with mclaren due to williams ignoring this year to focus on next regs and also having the merc engine, will have disadvantage due to lack of funding

6. Red Bull - Implosion for red bull with verstappens departure seeming iminent, newey wheatley leaving and horner may be out aswell, the switch to full works team may disadvantage them.

7. Alpine - Merc engine will be only saviour of this car

8. Haas - probably will have better aero and chassis than alpine but the new regs are mainly engine focused

9. Cadillac - New team so has catching up to do although will be working all throughout this year to try and catch up

10. Audi - Already struggling with engine will make them slow to start the new season

11. VCARB - just a worse version of the red bull
