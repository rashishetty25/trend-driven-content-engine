Yes, overtaking possibilities are limited, but not impossible. Races there are rarely processions, but better than that, it's a circuit that actually allows for defensive driving. There's been some great on track battles with cars trying to get ahead of the other after the first few corners, and those battles are so cool to see, especially seeing the cars fighting side by side out of the second corner.

It disappoints me whenever people shrug Hungary off as the track where you can't overtake on, because I never found that to be the case. Not every Hungarian Grand Prix is a classic, but I haven't seen any truly bad ones either, and I've been watching F1 since 2012. Even 2015 saw it host a good race.

As for a popular track that I don't like? It's got to be Spa. From 2012 to now, the only times I enjoyed the Belgian Grand Prix were in 2012, 2019 and 2024. The Belgian Grand Prix in 2013, 2018, 2020, 2022, 2023 and 2025 were amongst the worst races in their respective seasons.

I know it's a good track to drive on, I've done so many times in all of my racing games, but it's simply not a fun track to watch. I didn't even include the infamous 2021 on my worst races list, and I can't help but wonder the amount of damage that race has done to the Belgian Grand Prix's reputation.","['I like Monaco due to added importance to qualifying (which has produced some special laps in recent years) and strategy during the race (when not red flagged; looking at you, 2024 Monaco GP).

I know it's the best Canada has for F1, but it's too narrow for modern F1 and there's no space to have meaningful battles except bully the other car at the final chicane.

And lack of elevation and surrounding area is bland."", 'I don’t think COTA’s necessarily underrated but I really think it’s one of the best tracks in the whole calendar. The layout has a bit of everything and since the tyres tend to degrade a lot there’s usually a lot to do with strategy. I’ve seen every race there since 2019 and every single one was at least decent, and I can’t think of any other races on the calendar that have been that consistently good for that long. \n\nI kind of agree with you on Spa but I think my pick for being overrated is Montreal.

1o0z0b0,Max Verstappen's Chances at the WDC,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o0z0b0/max_verstappens_chances_at_the_wdc/,2025-10-08, Discussion,"Hey guys, you can call this hopium - from the past three races Max has been driving very well and I thought I'd simulate his chances at catching Oscar at the title battle.

Lets start by looking at some math.

* Drivers’ standings after Singapore: **Piastri 336, Norris 314, Verstappen 273**.
* Remaining rounds (6): **Austin (Sprint+GP), Mexico (GP), Brazil (Sprint+GP), Las Vegas (GP), Qatar (Sprint+GP), Abu Dhabi (GP)**.
* Points available: **GP win = 25, 2nd = 18, … down to 10th = 1**. Sprint points for P1–P8 = **8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1**. No fastest-lap bonus in 2025.

Total points still available to any single driver across those 6 rounds:

* For each Sprint+GP weekend = **33** (8+25), for GP-only weekends = **25**.
* Remaining totals: Austin 33 + Mexico 25 + Brazil 33 + Las Vegas 25 + Qatar 33 + Abu Dhabi 25 = **174 points remaining**.

Maximum theoretical final totals if someone scores everything:

* **Piastri theoretical maximum = 336 + 174 = 510.**
* **Verstappen theoretical maximum = 273 + 174 = 447.**

Which means the absolute ceiling for Oscar while still losing is +110 (to 446). Any scenario where Oscar scores ≥111 additional points cannot end with Verstappen beating him — because Verstappen’s mathematical maximum (if he took every remaining point) is +174, and 273 + 174 = 447, only one point higher than 336 + 110.

Practically this is an extreme, low-probability scenario: it requires **Verstappen to be perfect** (win every session) and **Piastri to be very consistently second/near-second but not quite accumulating enough**. It’s the tightest margin possible — a 1-point title.

Here are the simulated results:

**Austin — Sprint + GP**

Sprint: Verstappen P1 (8) / Piastri outside top-8 (0)

GP: Verstappen P1 (25) / Piastri P2 (18)

Weekend: **V +33 / O +18**

Cumulative: **V 306 / O 354**

**Mexico City — GP only**

GP: Verstappen P1 (25) / Piastri P2 (18)

Weekend: **V +25 / O +18**

Cumulative: **V 331 / O 372**

**Brazil (São Paulo) — Sprint + GP**

Sprint: Verstappen P1 (8) / Piastri P2 (7)

GP: Verstappen P1 (25) / Piastri P4 (12)

Weekend: **V +33 / O +19**

Cumulative: **V 364 / O 391**

**Las Vegas — GP only**

GP: Verstappen P1 (25) / Piastri P2 (18)

Weekend: **V +25 / O +18**

Cumulative: **V 389 / O 409**

**Qatar — Sprint + GP**

Sprint: Verstappen P1 (8) / Piastri P2 (7)

GP: Verstappen P1 (25) / Piastri P4 (12)

Weekend: **V +33 / O +19**

Cumulative: **V 422 / O 428**

**Abu Dhabi — GP only**

GP: Verstappen P1 (25) / Piastri P2 (18)

Weekend: **V +25 / O +18**

Final totals: **V 447 / O 446**

That yields **Verstappen 447, Piastri 446** — Max clinches by **1 point**.

After watching Charles' answer to Max's chances to be 20%, I thought I'd run  some simulations to see what Max's chances at the title were.","[""What a difficult way of calculating.
