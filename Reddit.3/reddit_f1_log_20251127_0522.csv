And it’s great to see Lando being such a role model inside Formula One, but also then especially outside Formula One.  
  
And I think that’s why also reason why he’s so popular, because he’s giving people that something else, not just, you know, racing. And okay, finishes 4th and finishes first. And you know, he’s popular because he wins and popular because of results and performances. But no, he’s giving people something else. And that’s what people appreciate. And if you ask people, they’re probably not able to phrase it perfectly. But I think that’s in essence why he is one of the most popular drivers on the grid.

Norris, Piastri, and Verstappen are currently all still in contention to win, however that can change in Qatar. No matter what, Norris cannot win in the sprint, but he can clinch in the GP if he:

* Outscores Piastri by 2 or more points (across the entire weekend) - unless Norris wins the GP, in which case he just needs to outscore Piastri by 1 point, and
* Outscores Verstappen by 1 or more points - unless Verstappen wins the GP, in which case Norris needs to outscore him by 2 points.

If Norris outscores only one of Piastri or Verstappen by the appropriate amount, that driver will be eliminated, even if Norris does not clinch the title.

**WCC:** Mercedes are getting close to clinching 2nd in the WCC, which they can do in Qatar if they:

* Outscore Red Bull by 4 or more points over the entire weekend, and
* Are not outscored by Ferrari by more than 10 points.

As with Norris, it will not be possible for them to clinch in the sprint.
