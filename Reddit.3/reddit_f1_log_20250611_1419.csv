In every race, the big discussion is about temperatures, how much life is left in them, their pressures, and so on. Since they got rid of refueling, it’s the only tactical component left in the race.

It’s the most important factor in how the race will play out. How come F1 hasn’t made an effort to present those figures like temperatures and pressures on the feed?

I know they had a brief period with thermal cams, but as cool as they looked, they didn’t really convey anything other than that tires get hot in corners or cold during a Safety Car period.

I’m convinced that if the information were publicly available, it would a) be super cool to know more about components of the car, and b) add an intriguing instrument to race tactics.

I know teams will hate it, but F1 management has the power to spice things up and give (hardcore) fans something interesting to study during the race.

What are your opinions?","['Assuming this requires team to share information (as tire wear effects each team differently) and they definitely don’t want to give that away.', ""They need to abstract it so much to make it digestible for anyone other than very, *very* hardcore viewers that it becomes meaningless in itself.

Charles Leclerc managed to get on the podium twice - in Monaco with a second place that almost tasted like a defeat, and a third place in Spain, partly fortunate, partly the result of good pace from the car - which were worth precious points. The SF-25, despite the debacle in qualifying at Imola, the most hostile track for the Italian car among the three of the triple-header, remains a car that in race pace shows it is capable of expressing second-force potential, especially in hot races.\n\n""On the pace we are more or less there. The characteristic of this car is that it suffers much more in qualifying than in the race."" (F.Vasseur)\n\nThe consistency in results that came from the European triple has allowed the Scuderia di Maranello to rise, almost unexpectedly, to second place in the constructors\' championship, overtaking a Mercedes that is still too erratic and with reliability problems, and a Red Bull still lacking in results from its second driver. The SF-25 remains “crippled” in performance by conservative set-ups to preserve skid wear. Pending the macro-development including the new rear suspension, the set-up compromise remains the car\'s big limitation. Info tells us that on the development front the situation is still very dynamic, but the internal operations relating to the 677 are close to being completed in order to make way in the tunnel for the 2026 car within the current month, as scheduled.\n\n**Ferrari with an evolving situation after the European triple header. In Spain no game changer but cars are more limited: the new directive cost the top teams 8 months of development.**\n\nA new front wing debuted in Spain, developed to comply with the new anti-flexion regulations imposed by the FIA. An update that had been expected and planned for months, making a virtue of necessity due to the T018 directive communicated to the teams at the end of January.\n\nNo substantial “game changer”, the wing directive has not materially altered the hierarchies, such for someone to consistently undermine a McLaren still with a technical advantage, but not super dominant. The values on the field, however, while not having seen radical changes in hierarchies, may not have been affected by the introduction of stiffer wings. Canada is already a further test.\n\nAn average loss of about a tenth is what the TD018 causes, with the Ferrari wing roughly back to pre-Austin 2024 stiffness values. An obligatory turnaround, which costs a top-team around eight months of work by the wing department, and around 50% of the budget spent on wing development. On-track feedback from the new specification in Barcelona was positive about the wing\'s new aerodynamic look. The loss of efficiency generated by the increased stiffness was partially offset by the new aerodynamics thanks to what we know to be a “more efficient” out-wash.\n\nFor the first few years of this regulation, the trend in wing shape was towards more extreme configurations, with upper flaps designed to increase the flow offset outside the front wheel envelope. With the rise of more flexing wings, the trend in aerodynamic form has shifted to having larger profiles in the mid-wing structure, taking advantage of controlled flexing to gain efficiency. It is clear that with TD some teams may have found better compromises than others. Some have managed to maintain good dynamic characteristics despite the stiffening of structures, thanks to more advanced materials.\n\n**Canadian GP: in 2024 it was a disaster with wrong pressures and colder weather. A stop & go track for an SF-25 with no updates**\n\nThe Montreal track with this generation of cars has never given Ferrari victories. In the first year Sainz was in a battle with Verstappen while Leclerc had no great luck. The technical and climatic characteristics are very different to the last three European races, and we return to a semi-city circuit with long straights, heavy braking and slow restarts: a classic “stop and go” track, where traction and braking are fundamental. A track that Hamilton has always liked, but with the Englishman still having to have full control of his car.\n\nTemperatures are lower than in scorching Barcelona, where switching on and windowing the tyres on the single lap remains the key issue in the simulator. Ferrari will return to using the “V-shape” rear wing configuration, with evaluation on the slightly trimmed flap configuration that ran in both Arabia and Italy. No significant updates are expected on the SF-25, which will not be reserving any new components for the overseas leg. Serra has been overseeing operations throughout the European triple, and the work in Maranello for Canada has been aimed at fine tuning the current package, making gold from the mistakes of 2024, when the Canadian GP represented one of the low points of the previous season, a gift to the competition that probably cost the world championship.\n\nTranslated by DeepL', '“the new directive cost the top teams 8 months of development.”\n\nPeople were saying Ferrari would be a big benefactor…\xa0\n\nNext Year ™️\xa0', 'Because they were planning to use this new geometry for the 2026 car.

Would he get a race ban for Canada, or for the next race?', ""Haas reaching 200 races really messes with my head. Growing up, 200 races used to be this massive thing, when a driver hit that milestone it was huge - very few did and it was only the 'veterans' that did it - likes of Schumacher, Barrichello or Coulthard, who'd been racing since before I was born. And now Haas, a team who debuted in 2016 are about to do it. I know it's because more races now, but still it screws with my perception of time."", 'Did they fix the porposing issue with the cars or just stop talking about it?', 'Have we had any confirmation yet if Stroll will be racing?', 'How many years do you think each of the current rookies will stay on the grid?', ""Long time Nascar fan going to my first F1 race in Montreal this weekend. \n\nPlan to spend all day Saturday and Sunday at the track.

1l8p9yy,The true impact of F1's mid-season rule change is still to come,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l8p9yy/the_true_impact_of_f1s_midseason_rule_change_is/,2025-06-11, News,,"[""meh, it's Oscar Piastri vs Max Verstappen vs Lando Norris this season.\n\nConstructor's is wrapped up, it's McLaren's"", ""I'm gonna run out of copium like this"", ""Those quotes from Fred align to my thinking during the race.
