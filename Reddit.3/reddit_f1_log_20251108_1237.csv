It's disappointing because they made so much of making sure any car updates had to keep 'to the spirit of the regulations' but that just seemed to be left behind.\n\nI haven't read much about the aero side of next year but I hope they think about where it went wrong in this generation and try to fix it."", ""How does he know for sure?

1. Drivers accumulate points for every position

3. Top 16 in the regular season (which lasts until Belgium here) Earns you a place in the playoff   
4. There are 4 post season round RO16, RO12, RO8 , and the final 4  
5. Everyone's points get reset apart from the postseason points you earn  
6. you get 5 bonus postseason points per regular season win   
7.Each knockout round runs for the 3 races where the bottom 4 get eliminated   
8. In the final race the final 4 go at it for the win whoever finishes ahead wins the WDC  
9. (This is for the NASCAR guys in this subreddit ) No stage points just cause the races are too short to implement it
