1m8y3k9,[AMuS] Verstappen is commited to stay at Red Bull for 2026. But Red Bull agreed to let him go for 2027 in case he wants to leave the team,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1m8y3k9/amus_verstappen_is_commited_to_stay_at_red_bull/,2025-07-25, News,,"['Great, now what are we gonna talk about over the summer break?', 'Would be interesting if George and Kimi only get 1 year contract extensions', 'This seems like a fairly smart move by Max. He might forfeit the chance at a 2026 title should Merc be capable of it, but he also eliminates the risk of being locked into a bad situation, be that Merc underperforming or committing to Red Bull only for their works engine to flop. \n\nAlso helps Merc avoid paying an enormous sum to buy him out right now.', 'This doesn’t fit my narrative', 'Google Translation \n\n> The Verstappen mystery is beginning to unravel. For months, the industry has been puzzling over whether the Dutchman will stay at Red Bull or join Mercedes. After Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff and Verstappen met during the break following the Silverstone race in Sardinia, rumors of a transfer were reignited.\n\n> The much-quoted exit clause will come into effect after the Belgian GP. According to this clause, Verstappen could leave if he finishes worse than third in the World Championship. With an 18-point lead over fourth-placed George Russell, this is rather unlikely, despite the points inflation on a sprint weekend.\n\n> It has since leaked out that Verstappen will stay with Red Bull in 2026. He still describes the team as his second family. And from his perspective, it\'s not about exit clauses or personnel matters, but about the team proving to him that it can build a competitive car. ""The last year and a half haven\'t been so good. Now we\'re looking ahead. We have to work on the car and improve it for this year, but also for next season.""\n\n> With this, the world champion is already confirming between the lines that he will definitely stay with Red Bull for another year. The defending champion\'s camp has realized that a hasty move will create more problems than it solves. As of today, no one can reliably predict who will have a good or bad chance next year. A fellow driver says: ""If you\'re going to make a mistake, it\'s better to do it with the team you\'re with. In 2026, you\'ll be able to make a much better choice with more knowledge.""\n\n> Verstappen would have to commit to Mercedes or another team long-term. Anyone who moves now can\'t immediately turn around a year later. At Red Bull, he would effectively be free at the end of 2026. Then the cockpits at Ferrari, Aston Martin, and Mercedes will also be filled.\n\n> Verstappen could, of course, continue driving for Red Bull if the team succeeds in challenging for victories, even under the new regulations. Verstappen\'s management has demanded this freedom. Team boss Christian Horner refused to accept it. This is said to have been the final piece of the puzzle for his disempowerment.\n\n> It would also be interesting to see what happens if Verstappen, contrary to expectations, slips to fourth place after the Belgian GP. Then Toto Wolff will have to consider the Verstappen option again.\n\n> In that case, Andrea Kimi Antonelli would probably have to leave and be parked at another Mercedes team. This is how one should interpret the statements of George Russell, who emphasized again in Spa: ""If you look at the facts, Mercedes can\'t get ahead of me.""\n\n> George Russell could live with Verstappen, even if the two drivers aren\'t best friends. ""I have respect, but I\'m not afraid of Max."" For Mercedes, it would be a fine line to form the two very different superstars into one team. That would almost be on the scale of what happened with Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost at McLaren. This speculation may already be history after the Belgian weekend. Then Mercedes will tell its drivers the truth.', 'There are so many conflicting reports about Verstappen’s contract and plans. Every story seems to be claiming something different\n\nI’m just waiting for August when Mercedes announce either a Russell contract extension or that they’ve signed Max. I honestly don’t think the people writing these articles know much more than the rest of us', ""Whichever team is quickest in 2026, that's where he'll go. Gambling on who'll rein in the new car at this point would be foolish. Prove it on the track and Max will come calling."", 'Plot twist: both Red Bull and Mercedes get fucked up by the rule changes', 'I think the speculation will continue until Mercedes or Red Bull make formal announcements', 'Now he gets to see how Mercedes, Aston Martin and Ferrari perform next year.']",3530,314,0.98,3530,6523,6523,43,3,0.0,43

Colapinto especially seems to struggle making it out of the bottom 2, and when he does, Gasly is usually there instead. However, it also seems like Gasly is consistently able to put it comfortably in the top 10, sometimes even top 5, at least once during a race weekend.

In some ways this all looks a but odd as the Alpine is famously down on power compared to other engine manufacturers. So how does he manage to qualify so well, particularly on a power circuit like Spa?\n\nSome might say well it's quicker in the corners but most of the analysis and commentary on the sport suggests that it's a pretty horrible car to drive"", 'Gasly is an amazing driver in one lap pace and the Alpine also seems decent in quali conditions as well.

There are drivers who struggles with it (for some reason Hulkenberg, who I thought was a good qualifier), and with that usually drops in Q1, as margins are really small.\xa0\n\n\nProblem for Alpine starts on Sunday, because this car makes it really difficult to manage tyres. They pretty much became the old Haas (18-19, and like in 23).\xa0\n\n\nAnd because its already difficult, inexperienced drivers struggles with it even more than Gasly, who is handling it just fine to score points sometimes.

As an accomplished sim racer, Verstappen is probably well placed to exploit this and drive fast without being able to feel the car as well - might explain why RedBull cannot seem to find a team mate able to consistently exploit the car\'s capabilities. Verstappen isn\'t a magician,  there is simply a performance ceiling where the car couldn\'t lap any faster that he can get close to. Piastri\'s McLaren has more front anti-dive than Norris is comfortable with and is therefore theoretically faster IF he can exploit it.\n\nEvery change to the suspension that impacts squat/dive is going to slightly change the optimal brake bias and how the downforce level changes under acceleration and braking. Lewis just found where the limit is. If you never come off the track, you aren\'t trying hard enough to go fast.\n\nOn a fast track like Spa, consistent ride height and the ability to deliver more consistent ground effect downforce is going to allow less top-down aero and a higher top speed.

SVT Sport: “The duel continues — F1 driver Ollie Bearman’s Varberg kart track record didn’t last a full week before Elton Zewenwacht, 23, reclaimed it.”  ￼

The story follows up on Bearman’s previously celebrated kart lap record in Varberg, where he clocked 28.97 seconds after several days of dedicated practice and technical fine-tuning—lighter clothing, chassis tweaks, fuel adjustments, setting tire pressure lap-by-lap, and even using a leaf blower to cool the engine  ￼.

-But a New Champion Emerges

Barely one week afterward, Elton Zewenwacht took the wheel. Unlike Bearman’s multi-day effort, Zewenwacht needed only a few laps to adapt—and then he broke the record. His new best: 28.95 seconds—two hundredths faster  ￼.

Zewenwacht, who previously had no competitive experience beyond rental karting, used the same kart—initially even with the same worn tires—and gradually improved. He slipped to 28.99 seconds before switching to fresh tires. By the third or fourth lap, he hit 28.95  ￼.

Despite outperforming an active Formula 1 driver, he kept things respectful:

“He can come back and try again,” he said gently, inviting Bearman to return for a rematch.","[""I've seen enough, put this man in the second red bull"", '>Unlike Bearman’s multi-day effort, Zewenwacht needed only a few laps to adapt—and then he broke the record.

Return to the standard qualifying format for the sprint, do the sprint. We then have a one lap quali session with drivers taking it in turns to do one lap, in the order the sprint finished. P1 gets a starting window (period of 15 minutes for example) to commence their outlap, driver 2 must be on their outlap before driver 1 crosses the timing line at the end of their flying lap and so on for the rest of the drivers.

Drivers towards the end would advantage from a developed track and the first driver could use that window if rain is forecast etc to push competitors into wet conditions. It has potential to mix the grid up a bit.
