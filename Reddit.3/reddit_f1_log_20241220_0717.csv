That being said, it's crazy to think how much of an effect Piastri has had on the current F1 landscape.  Alpine had him as a reserve with Alonso and Ocon as drivers. Alpine strung Alonso along knowing that they eventually wanted Oscar in that seat. Alonso as a result bolts, and Alpine loses a WDC champion driver. 

Then Oscar also leaves, and suddenly the cupboards are bare. Alpine sign Pierre from RB which was a good signing so we'll leave it at that for Alpine.  McLaren scoop up Piastri, and as a result, Danny Ric is bought out.  He sits out for a year*... 

The freed up spot at Alpha Tauri goes to De Vries. Nyck struggles, and after half a year, is sent back to Formula EEeeeEeee.  * Danny Ric takes his spot.

Three races later, Oscar spins out in a practice session. Instead of hitting him, Danny Ric who had a lot of momentum at the time, avoids him and hits the wall instead, breaking his hand.

Enter Liam Lawson, who takes Daniel's spot in the AT for the next 8 (?) races, and impresses tremendously. Danny comes back, and takes his spot back. 

Liam Lawson is brought back, but only as a reserve driver in the following season, surprising many. It's clear that he will be taking either DR's or Yuki's spot at some point.  DR struggles and as a result he's yeeted out of his car with 6 races to go. 

In those 6 races, Liam does enough to prove to RB that he's capable of driving for the parent team, and that he's a better candidate than Yuki. Sergio loses his spot, and Liam is promoted.

And none of this happens without Oscar.","['You forget about his manager, the real mastermind. \n\nNone of this happens without Mark Webber. \n\nNot bad for a number two driver.', 'I think you‚Äôre forgetting Vettel. \n\nHe retired on his own so that was the opening that left an open seat that Alonso grabbed and left an open spot Piastri didn‚Äôt even want.', 'One smart thing that Sauber did was grab Bortoleto, who won f3 and F2 in his first year just like Piastri, Leclerc, and Russel.', ""The timeline seems a bit off.

In fact, it could‚Äôve easily been Gasly in the McLaren and then you might have the more or less the same result. This makes Daniel the key in all of this, the one who started all the Red Bull 2nd seat mess by leaving for Renault/Alpine, jumping into McLaren, and then coming back to AT/VCARB to try to get that RBR seat back and failing.', ""Literally everything that has happened can be traced back to the things before, we live a determinist existence, but I don't think much here is significantly linked or dependent except for the Alpine collapse.

To better integrate into the Italian team, as well as Loic Serra himself, the English driver is taking Italian lessons and it was no coincidence that he expressed a few words in our language already in Abu Dhabi, while entering the Ferrari box. ‚Äú99% of our work is in English but I think it is nice to know how to speak a little Italian for the mechanics and for the relationship within the team‚Äù ‚Äì said Fred Vasseur in this regard, who then took care to underline also in a somewhat joking manner that ‚Äúit is not essential for performance‚Äù. \n\n\nVasseur: ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt difficult to convince Hamilton that the Ferrari project was excellent‚Äù\n\n\nBetween the end of last year and the beginning of 2024 , the planets aligned to bring Lewis Hamilton to Ferrari. ‚ÄúI think sometimes it\'s also a question of coincidences and last year they were all there, that is, Lewis was on the market and Ferrari had a seat available.‚Äù ‚Äì said the Ferrari TP at the traditional Christmas lunch in Maranello, who then wanted to focus on the arguments useful for convincing the seven-time world champion to accept the offer of the Italian team. ‚ÄúFirst of all, in 2023 we won more races than Mercedes.

I think it would make sense to pair Tsunoda with whichever American driver Cadillac decides to thrown into their car. Firstly I know he‚Äôs associated with Honda and the typical move would be to Aston Martin, but depending on Lance and Papa strolls plans that might not be realistic to get a drive in 2026. But you put him in a Cadillac I think he‚Äôd succeed. He‚Äôd be the senior driver of the two (which he has experience with Nick and Lawson), he has a hunger and fire in him that I think would mesh well with American fans, and Japan and Honda has a huge presence here in the states. I could see him contrasting well with whatever American personality you put next to him and it would work from a marketing and sports racing perspective. I think he‚Äôs matured a lot, has learned a lot, and I genuinely a top 12 driver on the grid. Let me know if this is wishful thinking but as an American I‚Äôd love to see him in a Cadillac!","[""Fuck me some of these reactions to the news are ludicrous.

Checo would be the top choice because he‚Äôs a vet familiar with the various regs, he‚Äôs one of the best midfield drivers available (which realistically should be Cadillac‚Äôs aim on their first few years) and should they nail the new regs, knows how to fight at the front. He‚Äôs also not averse to mentoring a young driver.

1hhpb3x,the Yuki bias?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hhpb3x/the_yuki_bias/,2024-12-19, Discussion,"I don't get all the Yuki love. I mean sure he's lovable but is that enough to get the RB seat? Feels more like a train everyone had boarded, logic be darned. Not saying he's a bad driver or that he doesn't deserve the seat, as he did his time but Lawson just makes way more sense.

Trial by fire because the grid in 2025 is going to be tight. That's the RBR way, feels like a return to old ways. Lawson is going to have to be up to the task, swim or sink. If he swims they'll have a good partnership for 2026. If he sinks, they'll get another, more experienced driver off the market for 2026.

Also Yuki's contract has one more year on it, Honda and their weird decision (again) to leave F1 hurt Yuki more than anything. Getting Yuki, they'd have to get a fresh driver for 2026, an year of unknowns. Better to have someone next to Max that has had some lashes of the whip that is going to be 2025. If Honda had stayed and got on the RBRPT project, 100% Yuki would have gotten the seat.

Having said that and Honda going to Stroll. Yuki in an AM vs Lawson in RBR in 2026 is going to be spicy.","['I mean we‚Äôre saying ‚Äòtrial by fire‚Äô but that didn‚Äôt work for Gasly or for Albon then they went with the experienced driver and that worked for multiple years before going downhill. Other than Max it‚Äôs just not worked and do we think Liam is another Max? Even Max had a full year at Toro Rosso with some mega performances which showed everyone that he was something special. \n\nI think the frustration is that Yuki has always shown he‚Äôs quick but he had to tone down his temper and become more consistent which he‚Äôs shown to have done. Other than the one incident at the beginning of the year he‚Äôs remained calm and consistent since. He‚Äôs also consistently outperformed every teammate he‚Äôs had. I think people are frustrated about this in the same way they were frustrated at Checo‚Äôs poor performance being allowed to go on so long.\n\nI hope Liam does well but I also hope Yuki can get out of the RB circus and get a chance to shine.', ""Truth is that no one 'deserves' a seat in f1. There will always be factors outside that play a role in who gets the seat. Tsunoda is a pretty good driver, but he isn't what RBR want"", 'There are much more nuisances in this situation than what Yuki deserves and what Lawson does not deserve.\n\nOn Lawson, is he a good drive with more potential? Yes. Is he an immediate WDC contender that can challenge Max? We can quite confidently say no. Not able to beat an experienced driver like Yuki does not mean he is bad, but it proves he doesn‚Äôt show his potential yet. For this type of driver, there is no rush to promote him, and giving him time to develop in the junior team is the best scenario to shape him into a reliable rear gunner. Why can‚Äôt he do that in RBR? To my opinion, RBR is not really a team for development. Their patience is thin, and they expect him to perform immediately, in a car that in 2024 even Max said sometimes it is not easy to drive. The constant pressure to a driver who only drove 11 races is a lot. Lawson could navigate it very well, and that means he will be with Max long term. If it doesn‚Äôt go well, RBR WCC position takes another hit with only one driver delivering for the team again. Fast tracking Lawson could setback his career development.\n\nDo I support RBR to promote Yuki because he deserves it? No. Do I expect he would be competitive against Max? No. Do I think he could contribute more than Lawson in the immediate term? To some extent, Yes. Yuki is objectively more ready to take the RBR seat within the RB stable, given his performance and also experience, and also let Lawson to develop more. If he is really really good, RBR can keep him until they see the next Max regardless of the Honda deal. Honda was clear thst they will support Yuki even he is not driving with their engines. If he is not good, RBR wants to sack him anyway, there are no harms.\n\nThe only reason for RBR to pick Lawson over Yuki now is if they think Lawson will perform better immediately in 2025 alongside Max which I am not convinced. I am more inclined to say RBR wants to burn through their Junior drivers until they have Linblad ready to drive for RBR. \n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.', 'I mean I think one of the biggest arguments is that because Yuki would be out 2026, there‚Äôs no harm in putting him in for 2025. If he sucks then they can drop him anyways. And having Liam in vcarb gives him more time and experience to develop as a driver without the harm of having max as your teammate. It was a win win.', 'Its not ""Yuki Bias""... \n\nI saw it the other way, It is more like Tsunoda ""hate"" are more strange because people stuck in the past...

1hhpk72,Why do people think Tsunoda over Lawson. Tsunoda is a Honda driver.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hhpk72/why_do_people_think_tsunoda_over_lawson_tsunoda/,2024-12-19, Discussion,"TL;DR - Tsunoda is a Honda driver, not an RB one.

Liam Lawson was the obvious choice surely? Tsunoda being a Honda driver, he‚Äôs probably going to leave for Aston Martin in 2026 following either Alonso‚Äôs retirement or then finally dropping Stroll. I know he‚Äôs had a large majority of his career with the RB family but he‚Äôs only there thanks to Honda supplying the engine.

Knowing this, Red Bull don‚Äôt want someone who‚Äôll be there for a year then leave, they want someone young to potentially be Verstappen‚Äôs successor (Ricciardo to Vettel).

With Hadjar most likely getting the vacant VCARB spot, if Lawson pulls a Gasly, I can see RB going for Hadjar instead of Tsunoda too. 

No shade on Yuki, on his day he can be amazing. I just don‚Äôt think Red Bull will want to waste time and money on a driver they know won‚Äôt be there next year.","['Alonso has a contract 2026 and stroll has an infinite contract, there is no space for him at Aston?!', '> Tsunoda being a Honda driver, he‚Äôs probably going to leave for Aston Martin in 2026\n\nWell, no, because why would he do that if he has a race-winning car?', ""Tsunoda getting into F1 with Honda does not at all mean he has to stay with them several years after the fact. It's such a weird idea that this would be the case, when for all other drivers we are open to movement between teams according to their performance. Especially since Tsunoda *also* has been a driver for a Red Bull team even if he didn't come from their junior program. If Tsunoda performed better than Lawson it would be very natural to give him an offer to drive in the Red Bull car."", ""The biggest reason is experience. Maybe people wouldn't be as hesitant about Lawson being promoted if he had more than 11 GP under his belt, like a full season or 2. Though that didn't help Gasly. \n\nBoth would probably falter alongside Max Verstappen, very few can probably keep up with him honestly, I just hope he can do better than Perez.\n\nAlso being a Honda driver shouldn't mean squat."", 'If you think Alonso will retire before the 2026 season where there is a new set of regulations and an Adrian Newey designed car you are insane!', ""Because Tsunoda is better and if offered would jump at the chance. Also I'm sure if needed he'd happily break the Honda link if it meant getting the chance to win races."", ""I don't even think its about Honda. Red Bull have the power to buy Yuki away from Honda and make him a Red Bull driver. \n\nThey just think that he has reaches his ceiling and that this is his pace. Clearly it isn't enough. They see Lawson holding his own against Yuki despite much less experience and are willing to take the slim chance that Lawson will grow much further into a driver that can support Max. \n\nThe choice between Yuki and Liam was one where Yuki would have definitely struggled and one where Liam will struggle at the start but may grow."", 'There is no way Lawrence Stroll is replacing a 2x world champion with Yuki Tsunoda. There is a pattern there. He is going after a top driver once Alonso retires.', 'For the reason you stated Yuki is a Honda driver promote him let Max destroy him and then get rid of him next year if that‚Äôs what happens, alternatively he impresses and you make him a RB driver not a Honda one. Let Lawson and Hadjar find their feat at racing bulls and promote the better looking option in 2026. Nothing I‚Äôve seen of Liam right now makes me think he would be superior to Yuki in the RB seat.']",0,65,0.26,0,315,315,0,0,-0.010000000000000009,0
