In Formula 1, when they hand out the trophies, they do it in the order 1st place → 2nd place → 3rd place.

The winner is literally called up first, gets their trophy, and then just kind of stands there waiting while 2nd and 3rd get theirs. It feels anticlimactic. Like… why does the most important moment happen right away, and then we backtrack?

Does anyone know why they do it this way? Is it a practical thing or?

Honestly, I find it kind of annoying every time. Am I the only one?

I mean, Lawson got off to a miserable start in Red Bull. Then he got 'demoted' to RB and has looked much better since.

And that only compounds upon the widely understood notion that F2 championships can in many ways feel like a bit of a lottery, with engines not always seemingly performing the same for each driver and where a driver’s team they signed with mattering as much, if not more, than their own talent. “Yeah, I mean, it’s European racing, so there’s a lot of politics that go into it,” he said. “They make sure that the people they want to succeed, succeed.

F2 would also allow him to be permanent reserve driver for Cadillac and be at every F1 race instead of only when his Indycar schedule allows, which would help enormously in learning how things operate off track and also learning from the experienced Bottas and Perez, particularly when it comes to things like debriefs.\n\nHe's not going to win an Indycar title any time soon, the Andretti pit wall are too much of a shambles for him to mount a decent challenge, especially against the might of Palou and Ganassi, so it's not like leaving for F2 for a year would rob him of anything significant in Indycar.
