What kind of wrongdoing incited their ire?\n\n\nHe criticized Ecclestone in the French press for being driven by greed, wanting to control everything, and generally doing the opposite of what should be done.\n\n\nAlthough Ecclestone technically had no jurisdiction and, therefore, no power over the competitors, his good fellow Mosley, as the President of FISA, enjoyed the aforementioned privileges. Hence the threat of a race ban.\n\n\nProst Draws a Line in the Sand\n\n\nThe Frenchman took the pole position for the South African Grand Prix, and at the press conference, he made it unequivocally clear that he would retire for good if FISA imposed a ban on him.\n\nProst won the race, leaving the governing body with a hard nut to crack.\n\n\nWhether to call the three-time world champion, the legend of the sport who has returned to F1 after a hiatus, recently added a 45th win to his resume, and is currently leading the standings, to determine if he is bluffing, or to fold?\n\n\nFISA chose the latter.', ""You weren't kidding, Prost might be one of the few to get away by making Bernie fold in a standoff this openly and not paying a terrible price for it."", 'Thank you,', 'He masterfully played his hand.']",73,9,0.79,73,8,8,6,1,0.010000000000000009,6

That is in no way comparable to Lewis losing his eighth title.""\n\n> ""It was just the anger at that moment towards one person and that was emotionally draining. Even Lewis needed a few days to get back to normal. It\'s still with us, given the unfairness of that day. But it\'s not like it\'s on our minds all the time and that it bothers us.""\n\n> Then Wolff elaborates on Masi. ""I really tried to talk to Michael and guide him throughout the year. I said to him: \'Listen, I\'ve been in the sport for a long time. Listen to the drivers. Don\'t be stubborn in making decisions and don\'t be arrogant\'. I tried to do that for the good of the sport and of course for us as a team. That way we wouldn\'t be vulnerable in situations that could be very bad. But in that sense it\'s just unforgivable what happened.""\n\n> The Austrian continued: ""I realise how he feels and I know that it\'s not good. It\'s bad. But he could have thought about it all year and some people, not just me, tried to support him in the right way. Sometimes you just have to realise that someone is just doing their own thing or making their own decision. So I don\'t care anymore. We\'re talking about it now, but we\'re actually wasting our time now. It\'s not relevant anymore.""', '> ""I really tried to talk to Michael and guide him throughout the year.

That must suck.', ""NGL, that whole situation still pisses me off when someone mentions it, but it's happened... it's history now. Focusing on it constantly isn't healthy at all. \n\nToto needs to just stop talking about it when asked in interviews."", '🥱', 'Have we gone back in time?', ""Ultimately Lewis lost it throughout the rest of the season, it never should have come down to AD, it only did because of Silverstone and Hungary.\n\nPlenty of other examples where Lewis and Max gained or lost due to race director decisions, it's silly to pretend AD was the only race in the entire season, had Lewis not messed up his brake magic in Baku he'd have won as well and that was for 25 points and not 7.\n\nIt's so easy to point fingers at Masi for losing you points instead of taking responsibility for their own mistakes that lost them even more.""]",0,56,0.26,0,53,53,0,3,0.010000000000000009,0
