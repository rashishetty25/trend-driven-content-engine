I think we‚Äôve been very good at being open about it, just talking about it.‚Äù\nWhile he and Norris are aiming for a maiden title win this season, McLaren‚Äôs current level is such that the Australian reckons several more title fights are on the horizon ‚Äì meaning maintaining harmony between the pair is a top priority.\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre never going to do anything that‚Äôs unsportsmanlike or puts the team in a bad light or puts ourselves in a bad light. I think that‚Äôs just not who Lando and I are,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúOf course, we want to go out and beat each other every weekend, but we‚Äôre never going to cross that line that‚Äôs going to cause damage that can‚Äôt be repaired. Because, I‚Äôve said it a few times now, we don‚Äôt want just one opportunity at this.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre both at McLaren for a very long time after this year, and we want to fight for the championship every single year. I think we both understand it‚Äôs pretty unwise to try and win one championship and bring the house down with it.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs a unique situation, as Piastri acknowledged. It‚Äôs not so long ago since Mercedes encountered fallout between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg as the former childhood friends fell out in similar circumstances, and the Australian praised McLaren for its hands-off handling of things.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think every team would handle it as we are, no,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúAt the same time, there are not many teams in our situation with a car and drivers that are strong enough‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve got a very good lead in the Constructors‚Äô Championship at the moment and, whilst we‚Äôre continuing to build that gap, I think it‚Äôs the right thing to do to let us both try and fight for a championship.‚Äù\n\nThere will come a point where he believes the team should start imposing team orders as it closes in on the titles ‚Äì but only if one of the pair develops a big enough lead to warrant some level of support.\n\n‚ÄúI think, once it‚Äôs mathematically impossible, probably,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúBut no, I think we both want to win or try and fight for this championship and score our own points.\n\n‚ÄúOf course, if there becomes a time, later in the year, where it is genuinely impossible ‚Äì or very close to it ‚Äì then, then, yes, maybe that will change, but I don‚Äôt see that happening for a very long time.‚Äù\n\nHaving had a run of momentum that saw him take wins in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Miami, Piastri was beaten by Norris at Imola and Monaco, and said he suspects this pattern of momentum switching will continue through the year.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to ebb and flow a bit through the whole year,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúBut, I mean, I‚Äôm confident we‚Äôve analysed what went a little bit wrong in Monaco.\n\n‚ÄúI mean, it still wasn‚Äôt a terrible weekend, but just not as good as some of the weekends have been this year for me. So we‚Äôve looked at what we can do a bit better, and we‚Äôll try and put that in action.‚Äù\n\n___________________________________________\n\nPiastri‚Äôs comfort with the dynamic at McLaren will be welcomed by Zak Brown, who outlined his position on his driver‚Äôs assured equality during an exclusive interview with PlanetF1.com.\n\n‚ÄúFor us, it‚Äôs quite an easy thing to work through,‚Äù Brown explained.\n\n‚ÄúOur drivers aren‚Äôt asking for favouritism, they‚Äôre asking for fairness, and that‚Äôs what they get.\n\n‚ÄúI think they‚Äôre very comfortable; may the best man win.\n\n‚ÄúHopefully we give them a car in an environment where you‚Äôre going into the last race and it‚Äôs the two of them competing, and they didn‚Äôt take points off each other to the point where it lets Max [Verstappen] or someone else get in there.\n\n‚ÄúBut if so, then whoever wins the Drivers‚Äô Championship has done a better job.‚Äù\n\nsacrifice [Yuki] Tsunoda‚Äôs qualifying because he‚Äôs giving Max a tow or whatever.‚ÄúI get compromising the second car at Red Bull because it‚Äôs not competing for the Drivers‚Äô Championship, so it‚Äôs an easy decision to make.\n\n‚ÄúBut when you‚Äôve got two drivers first and second in the championship and are separated by less than one second place finish, how do you possibly even consider standing one down into a supporting role?\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just no way we will.‚Äù', 'Why do people get upset with this?

1kzdi10,[AMuS] The big wing quake doesn't happen,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kzdi10/amus_the_big_wing_quake_doesnt_happen/,2025-05-30, News,,"[""Mclaren won by 30-40 seconds in Miami, that advantage isn't just a front wing difference."", ""Yeah, it hasn't shuffled the field that much, but long stint pace are not conclusive (as in article), race will give us better picture i think."", 'Translation:\n\n> **The race for the world championship title remains tight between Max Verstappen and the two McLaren drivers. The stricter front wing regulations haven\'t rocked the Formula 1 world. Mercedes and Ferrari have moved somewhat closer.**\n\n> We don\'t need to rewrite the Formula 1 World Championship. The stricter front wing regulations haven\'t upset the balance of power between the teams. McLaren is still ahead, both on a single lap and in the long run. Max Verstappen is close. This has to do with the fact that Barcelona is a Red Bull track. The hope that stiffer front wings would upset the balance of the papaya racers was not fulfilled.\n\n> Mercedes has rediscovered its form from the first six races. But only for one lap. During the long run, the tires overheated. Ferrari delivered a solid performance. The gap to the leaders was half a second, slightly less than last time.\n\n> In the midfield, Aston Martin performed well on a single lap and Alpine on the long run. Toro Rosso showed the most balance. Their speed is good both on a single lap and over the distance.\n\n> Sauber has made a noticeable leap forward with its new aero package. Nico H√ºlkenberg\'s strong endurance run underscores that the Sauber has become more predictable. Williams, as expected, is struggling. The car doesn\'t thrive in the long corners. Haas had the same problem and plummeted to the bottom of the standings.\n\nSix things you need to know:\n> **1) Has the new front wing rule shuffled the field?**\nNot at all. On one lap, McLaren is ahead of Mercedes, Red Bull, Ferrari, Aston Martin, Alpine, Toro Rosso, Sauber, Williams, and Haas. That\'s almost normal. Aston Martin looks slightly better than recently, Williams slightly worse. That depends on the track. Sauber and Alpine have made a leap with their upgrades. Haas adjusted the setup in the wrong direction after a strong first practice. On one lap, Mercedes is a pole position contender. But the Silver Arrows suffered a setback in the long run.\n\n> **2) Who has the fastest car in the long run?**\nWhen comparing the long runs, much depends on the time in the second practice session they were completed and the distance they covered. George Russell drove the longest stint on soft tires with 16 laps. Piastri was the marathon man on the medium tires with 14 laps. We only count the fast laps without cool-down periods or time lost due to traffic. The length of the race simulation logically puts pressure on the lap times. This is why Russell and Norris are far down in the standings.\n\n> Max Verstappen and Lando Norris are difficult to compare. Both completed a long run on the soft and medium tires, but at different times. Verstappen started on the medium and then switched to the soft. Norris did the opposite. Therefore, the world champion was faster in the soft long run, while Norris was faster in the medium endurance run. The difference was three to four tenths per lap. Taking the weight factor into account, it\'s a close race. The second stint was obviously helped by the fact that there was less fuel in the tank at the end.\n\n> The Ferrari drivers split their time in sync. First medium, then soft. Lewis Hamilton leads the soft long runs. However, he only completed three hot laps on the set. Oscar Piastri took the fastest time of the day, but suffered a setback in the endurance run. In 14 laps on the medium tires, the Australian only managed an average of 1:20.966 minutes. ""Things didn\'t go well in the first practice session. It wasn\'t until the second that we slowly found our way back to form,"" he said.\n\n> **3) Ferrari: Good or Evil?\nAfter the first practice session, Ferrari\'s faces were relaxed. Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc finished third and fourth, surprising even themselves. Barcelona hasn\'t exactly been one of the red cars\' signature tracks in the past. In the afternoon, with temperatures of 31 degrees Celsius in the shade, the corners of their mouths drooped again. Leclerc slipped to fifth place, half a second off Piastri\'s fastest time.\n\n> Hamilton, finishing eleventh, didn\'t even make the top ten. The Englishman complained about the car\'s balance. ""It was a confusing day with good and bad moments. But I think the final setup changes on Saturday should help us."" Leclerc expressed his positive surprise: ""It was a positive day. In the heat, everyone has less grip. That\'s why it\'s difficult to assess the cars\' true potential. But I feel like we still have something up our sleeve with our car.""\n\n(1/2)', ""A front wing can't make a car dominant. Look at the tires and floor if you want your answer."", 'About as big as the party-mode ban', '> **4) Has Mercedes recovered?**\nMercedes is back. Second and fifth place finishes for George Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli are reminiscent of the car\'s shape before Imola. Mercedes had already tested the new front wing on the car at Imola and, with its stiffer structure, had already conducted a practice session. So, the engineers knew what to expect. In Barcelona, \u200b\u200ba new underbody and a track-specific rear wing rounded out the upgrade. The Mercedes drivers were still reserved in the first practice session. Antonelli complained of bouncing. This was gone by the second session.\n\n> Nevertheless, Mercedes wasn\'t entirely satisfied. ""On one lap, we\'re back to where we were before. In the long runs, we were too slow,"" summarized team principal Toto Wolff. Once again, excessive tire temperatures were to blame. And that couldn\'t be blamed solely on the track temperature of 48 degrees.\n\n> ""The left front tire and both rear tires were already overheating after just three or four laps,"" Wolff lamented. Amazingly, the tires recovered in the second half of Russell\'s soft stint. ""The average lap time doesn\'t justify the conservative start to the stint,"" Wolff said critically. Mercedes wisely switched both race simulations to Pirelli\'s C3 compound. Last year\'s race showed that the soft tire is a viable option in a race.\n\n> **5) Why is Aston Martin so strong?**\nFernando Alonso\'s seventh-place finish was unexpected. Aston Martin had a lot of respect before Barcelona. The long corners had been a challenge for the green cars in the past, losing too much downforce when the wheels were turned and the car was rolling over its longitudinal axis. This time, the setup was adjusted from the first lap. Like McLaren and Sauber, Aston Martin opted for a touch less downforce than the rest of the field. Alonso was the fastest on the home straight at 334 km/h.\n\n> The Aston Martin engineers explained the surprisingly good performance by saying that the competition seemed to be having more trouble with the car\'s balance, but that they themselves had gotten used to it and therefore weren\'t losing as much as others. Chief engineer Mike Krack warned against excessive euphoria: ""The field is so tightly packed that the slightest mistake has a high price to pay."" In fact, the first 14 cars were within one second of each other. And that was on a challenging track like Barcelona.\n\n> **6) What can the Clean Upgrade do?**\nSauber can be satisfied with one lap. Nico H√ºlkenberg finished 12th with the new aero package. Gabriel Bortoleto was four-tenths slower with the old specification. This is above the predicted improvement. The Brazilian will also be driving the completely redesigned C46 starting Saturday. The changes to the front wing, underbody, and sidepods have only slightly increased tip downforce, but noticeably improved aerodynamic stability. H√ºlkenberg\'s first impression: ""The car felt good from the first lap. The new parts are working as intended. The car balance has improved, and I have more confidence in the car."" This was also evident in the long run. H√ºlkenberg completed ten laps on the medium tires. His average time of 1.20.516 was impressive. \n\n(2/2)', '>Toro Rosso\n\n\nGood lads.', ""You have to look at the entire package, from the aero, suspension, cooling systems and so on.   \nWhatever McLaren's done it looks to be something inherent in the overall design of the MCL39.

You can see how well a driver did (H2H, mean and median gap) against their teammate\n\n* over a season\n* over all qualifying sessions they took part in as teammates \n* against all his teammates at a particular circuit\n\nI compared times from sessions both drivers participated in. I.e. if driver A made it to Q3 and driver B got out in Q1, then their Q1 times were used. This means results such as Norris v Piastri in 2025 Saudi went to Norris because he crashed and couldn't set a Q3 time but was faster in Q2.\n\nThere is also a fourth feature where you can see how far off a driver's best time is from the fastest driver for every quali session in a season. I thought it would be interesting to see how the gap to the fastest changes over a year (like how Verstappen got closer and closer to Mercedes in 2020, or how Alonso got further away in 2023).\n\nData was fetched from the Jolpica (formerly Ergast) API. Only data from the 1994 season onwards is available (so unfortunately no Prost v Senna). There is also a lot of data from the late 90s and early 2000s seasons missing, so you may find it weird that only 32 results for Coulthard v Hakkinen across their career are shown.\n\nI am planning to make a post here about it but wanted some feedback first.
