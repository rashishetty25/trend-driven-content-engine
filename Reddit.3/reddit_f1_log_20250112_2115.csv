1hzm2mw,My Childhood F1 Board Game - from 1978!,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hzm2mw/my_childhood_f1_board_game_from_1978/,2025-01-12, Throwback,"Recently found my childhood F1 board game, and thought you guys might enjoy it! I think the “Brief Idea of the Game’ is well worth a read, because dice are not used to determine distance moved. It is for each played to decide how much to accelerate/decelerate, and still make the corner(!). Pit cards & tactical cards provide a further element of risk/reward. Tire & brake wear are significant factors, and are tracked via each player’s steering wheel indicators.

Has anyone been to this? It strikes me as some thing for the non-F1 fan, but I could be wrong.

If anyone has been, what does it have and how long does it take to do the whole thing?

Hopefully it’s not just a bunch of static exhibits but has more things to do etc than just walking round and seeing a bunch of old F1 cars.

I’ve not bothered to check their website as of course they will hype it up (perhaps Horner did the wording!).

Thanks.","['I went Friday night about 4pm and it was around 2 hours long.
