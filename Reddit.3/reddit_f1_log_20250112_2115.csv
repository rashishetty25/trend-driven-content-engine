I think the ‚ÄúBrief Idea of the Game‚Äô is well worth a read, because dice are not used to determine distance moved. It is for each played to decide how much to accelerate/decelerate, and still make the corner(!). Pit cards & tactical cards provide a further element of risk/reward. Tire & brake wear are significant factors, and are tracked via each player‚Äôs steering wheel indicators.

Has anyone been to this? It strikes me as some thing for the non-F1 fan, but I could be wrong.

If anyone has been, what does it have and how long does it take to do the whole thing?

Hopefully it‚Äôs not just a bunch of static exhibits but has more things to do etc than just walking round and seeing a bunch of old F1 cars.

I‚Äôve not bothered to check their website as of course they will hype it up (perhaps Horner did the wording!).
