Look you laugh but you will have more people visit if it was in Nebraska than in Las Vegas. Not because there is stuff do there, Vegas literally has the most stuff to do than any city, but because in Nebraska there is absolutely nothing to do and because of that everything is cheaper.  Yes there is stuff to do there, alot of awesome stuff actually. Chad Kroger of nickel back said that omaha is the coolest place no one has ever been too. That makes it ideal. Heck it has the ""American museum of speed"".

The state of 2.7 million people has filled a 82,000 football stadium for over 400 games...And the team hasn't been since 1995.  So you have a baked in population that will show up yo things.  yes Vegas has that but clearly half the people didn't show, I dont blame them most Vegas residents barely tolerate the the shenanigans.  

Nebraska would be the combination of having a track in the middle of nowhere (spa, Bahrain) so you can do exactly what you want, but also have a built infrastructure 10 minutes away, (dutch gp) this is Exactly what F1 and more importantly what f1 fans needs. They don't need empty seats, nor do they need to pay billions to build a single building. ","['This is a wild post.
