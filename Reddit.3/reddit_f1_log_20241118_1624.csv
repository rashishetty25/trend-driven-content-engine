They were relatively good in Las Vegas, so I hope to see a repeat of that this time around', 'The manhole covers of Vegas yearn for the experimental floor', ""Translation \n\n\nWith three races to go, McLaren must defend a 36-point lead over Ferrari and 49 over Red Bull , Mercedes had recovered many points in the summer but the threat has quickly deflated. It can be a lot or a few, depending on your perspective. After the start of the season, it was unpredictable to see a Red Bull suffering for 10 races. However, the internal war between Horner and the Austro-Dutch faction had undermined its stability and perhaps its technical clarity . Huge figures such as Newey and Wheatly have left or will gradually leave the team. Some experienced designers and specialist engineers have moved to Ferrari , the recruitment campaign for the 2026 engine was good but did not take away big figures from the competition. Verstappen, Marko and Horner have signed an indefinite truce to at least secure the drivers' title.\n\n\nMcLaren found itself stronger than observers (and even itself) had predicted . Despite several errors of maturity (but it was not the only one this year) it can return to success after 27 years. After Interlagos the team could see the pressure on Lando Norris eased, now with very low chances of bothering Verstappen, which on the one hand cannot be considered positive but on the other it could prove useful to better express its important speed. Red Bull has shown signs of improvement but the Woking car starts as a contender for victory in two out of three races. The task of Ferrari, who finds itself the first pursuer, is not easy and it is not impossible . Not to mention variables out of control such as temperatures and complex conditions, competitiveness in races such as Abu Dhabi and Lusail will fundamentally depend on the position in qualifying. The SF-24 overall was not able to do well on a single lap or at low track temperatures . The situation has improved a lot with the changes in Monza, but it could not be resolved in every condition.\n\n\nExclusive: In Las Vegas, Ferrari will test an experimental chassis useful for the 677 project.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúIf we find something (in the tunnel) we will try it,‚Äù Vasseur had said. In fact, the most important updates have been completed, however Ferrari will have a specific experimental underlay available for Friday‚Äôs free practice, useful for correlating the new 2025 car . For budget cap reasons, being a component useful only for testing, in America there will be only one underlay that, according to the plans, both drivers will have the opportunity to try for a run. It is certainly a way to verify some steps forward in the implementation of the basic underlay of the 677 model , which will also have a much more advanced design than the current one. Nonetheless, no one is confident that they have definitively stifled the hopping, the engineers want to make sure they continue development with a good anti-porpoising metric (thanks to the Monza spec) in the most sensitive areas.\n\n\nThe real novelty in Las Vegas will be the availability of a front wing that is lighter than the Monza specification (which will be present) that can be used if the track offers satisfactory levels of grip. On the rear, however, the technicians will choose the best option between the SPA and Monza specifications. Ferrari does not have a PU change in its starting program on Leclerc's no. 16. In Brazil, qualifying and the wet race, exceptionally performed on the same day, allowed the Monegasque's freshest unit to be saved stress and km of degradation. The technicians plan to continue the rotations within the elements of the available pool.  This year there will not be a full white and red livery as happened on the SF-23, we will see a small distinctive note. The drivers' and mechanics' uniforms will also feature a logo to commemorate the launch of 'Gladiator II' . The Maranello team knows that the very fast Las Vegas track represents the best opportunity of the three remaining to close the gap on McLaren."", 'Lewis seeing the ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù Ferrari go P1 in the H.M.S Silver Arrow: *Interesting*', 'I‚Äôm not sure about the experimental floor.
