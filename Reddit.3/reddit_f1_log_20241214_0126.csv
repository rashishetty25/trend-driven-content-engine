Red Bull outscored Mercedes by 121 points in the constructors. Checo finished the season on 152 points, meaning so long as he gave a 32 points swing over Mercedes, Red Bull would still outscore Mercedes.

His first 2 races were 2nd places, meaning he scored 36 points in those 2 races. In the remaining 22 races, he prevented 18 points from going to Mercedes via his finishing results. This means  Checo would have had to race Australia (where he scored 10 but didn't affect Mercedes who finished 17 (RUS) and retired (HAM)) and also Japan where he scored 18 points to secure the constructors bronze medal for Red Bull.

That is also why some drivers, like Tom Belsø (🇩🇰), is only mentioned for some years and not others. Belsø had only attended Free Practice in one race in 1973, and so I did not add that year.

1hdkfcc,How F1 employee bonuses work in the budget cap era,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1hdkfcc/how_f1_employee_bonuses_work_in_the_budget_cap_era/,2024-12-13, Discussion,"McLaren can give 12mil to employees in bonuses and have it not count against the budget cap.

Most other teams can give 10mil.

Haas and any other team that finished higher this year than they did any of the previous three years can also give 12mil to their employees excluded from budget cap.

Edit: To do the math, assuming teams pay their full bonus, McLaren employees got a 20% increase in bonus compared to last year, and Red Bull employees got a 16.67% decrease. Now, teams might not choose to pay this much in bonuses. Individual teams might have goals they have to meet to get their bonuses by their individual employee contracts. Just like teams don't have to spend the whole budget cap in the first place. For instance, it might be in Red Bull's employee's contracts that they have to place top 3 in the WCC or no bonus at all. But they might have something much more lenient. Just like driver contracts, we don't know what are in employee contracts.

Quote from the regulations:

""Excluded Bonus Maximum Amount"" means:

(a) for each F1 Team that either wins the Constructors’ Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period, or achieves a higher finishing position in the Constructors’ Championship taking place in the applicable Reporting Period than it achieved in any of the previous three Reporting Periods, US Dollars 12,000,000; and

(b) for each other F1 Team, US Dollars 10,000,000""

I did not understand how any of this worked until looking up the regulations, and I don't think many people understand how it works either. I did this digging to comment on another post that the poster deleted, but I thought it was interesting and other people might not know, so I wanted to post it anyway.

Here's the source, it's on page 37: [https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia\_formula\_1\_financial\_regulations\_-\_issue\_19\_-\_2024-02-13.pdf](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_formula_1_financial_regulations_-_issue_19_-_2024-02-13.pdf)","['So 12 Mil if you win or place higher in a season than you did over the last 3 seasons otherwise 10 mil?', 'It’s an attempt to make sure bonuses are actually bonus not just base salary with a different name to get around the cost cap. Obviously very limited in impact with the actual delta being 2m.', ""Yup. Not winning the WCC isn't actually has huge a monetary blow on the higher end of the standings and the bonuses being capped to an extent is irrelevant when you bring so much money in through sponsorships to begin with. \n\nThat is why RB and the horny man do not care about their WCC standing. It doesn't actually hurt their bottom line, it doesn't actually hurt the ability to pay bonuses but it does buy them more wind tunnel and CFD time and that actually is as close to priceless as possible when you're headed into a new reg era."", 'The regulations also say \n\n>""Employee Bonus Costs"" means those amounts payable pursuant to a Formal Bonus Scheme, to the \nextent such amounts are determined solely by reference to the F1 Team’s and/or its F1 Drivers’\nclassification in the Championship or by reference to the F1 Team’s and/or its F1 Drivers’ points, \npodiums or race wins in respect of the Championship, or any combination of the foregoing, in the \nReporting Period\n\nWhich I take to mean that the amount paid in bonuses must be linked to on track performance.

That is money that teams are allowed to pay in bonuses and not have it count against the budget cap.\n\nOf course, some teams may not spend the entire budget cap.', 'these are employee bonuses. The money Red Bull lost is a lot more', ""I mean, employees aren't usually thrilled if their bonus is 16.67% lower than last year, but it's not as big of a deal as I think a lot of fans think the difference is as an employee. edit: assuming the teams pay the maximum they are allowed under the cost cap.\n\nOf course, the team misses out on tens of millions finishing 3rd instead of theoretically 1st, but sponsorship money can cover that.""]",26,18,0.75,26,16,16,9,-1,0.030000000000000027,9

It seems like an easy compromise, especially if this is played as a ""Checo can mentor the driving academy guys"" and ""he can fight to get his seat back"" narrative.  Does RB really value the development aspects of the CARB team so much they would rather fire Checo from the RB team than give up the seat?","['Ricciardo already did that and see how that went.
