1ml10j4,How does the dirty air and downforce mechanic effect wet racing ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ml10j4/how_does_the_dirty_air_and_downforce_mechanic/,2025-08-08, Discussion,"As you all know we can‚Äôt really see much racing in F1 in ground effect era. They usually get red flagged due to visibility and safety issues. But I remember/know them being much less frequent in previous eras. But how do they affect it ? 

I know that Pirelli tried and tested using tyre arches to reduces spray but I‚Äôve also read that they weren‚Äôt as successful as they want it to be and the main issue was the floor. But I don‚Äôt really know how that works since I‚Äôm not educated in technical areas. 

While I was looking for some answers I found out that the dirty air mechanic changed quite a bit (and also loopholes are exploited) and they‚Äôre the reason but there weren‚Äôt any explanations that I coul find. Can anyone explain it please 

  
TL,DR : I don‚Äòt know how ground effect floor effects wet racing and couldn‚Äôt find any explanation and I‚Äôm asking here for one 

  
Thanks ","['The main issue with wet racing is the spray that is generated. This is worse the further back you are - P1 only has the safety car‚Äôs spray coming up in front of them, P20 has the safety car and 19 other cars in front of them.\n\nThe ground effect works like an upside down airplane. The car is sucked down onto the floor which helps push the wheels into the ground and means it propels the car forwards more effectively and that steering is more effective. However, when it‚Äôs raining, the ground effect sucking the car onto the floor pushes more spray up from the floor in turn. So if we took a 2021 car and a 2025 car, and had them drive around a wet track, the 2025 car would generate more spray.\n\nIf the drivers can‚Äôt see, it‚Äôs not safe to race. Look at Hadjar on Antonelli in Silverstone, Hadjar couldn‚Äôt see Antonelli‚Äôs taillights through the spray until he was in the back of him.', 'Ground effect cars generate downforce by creating a low pressure region beneath the car. The basic idea works like this:\n\nAs the engine propels the car forward, air enters the area beneath the floor. This air is accelerated as it flows through the underside of the car. The acceleration is typically achieved by narrowing the space between the car and the ground. This is often done using Venturi tunnels, if you are interested in the specific shapes that help accelerate the flow.\n\nAs the air speeds up, its pressure drops. This follows directly from Bernoulli‚Äôs principle.\n\nWith lower pressure beneath the car and higher pressure above it, the car is effectively pushed downward. The air above forces the car toward the ground. This is what creates downforce. The car is quite literally pressed into the track by atmospheric pressure because of the lower pressure underneath.\n\nOnce the minimum pressure is reached under the car, the air must gradually return to atmospheric pressure. This process is called diffusion. Diffusion increases the pressure while slowing the air back down.\n\nFor ground effect to work effectively, large volumes of air need to be moved through the Venturi tunnels and then expanded in the diffuser. On a wet track, this means a lot of water on the surface gets sucked in, accelerated through the tunnels, and ultimately expelled out of the rear of the car.\n\nPrevious generations of cars relied more heavily on front and rear wings to generate downforce. As a result, they did not pick up as much water from the track surface ‚Äî only the spray from the tires. That still happens with current cars, but now the ground effect system adds significantly more spray from the underbody.', 'More than anything to do with the aerodynamics, F1 became a lot more conservative about racing in the rain after Jules Bianchi died when they were literally racing in a typhoon.', 'To see the practical results, see the 1998 Belgian GP', 'Also to note inters and wets have a larger diameter than slicks so that raises the cars ride height and decreases the DF generated by the floor.', 'thanks', 'Thanks a lot', 'Stupid solution that I thought about during the last rain delay... since running in the wet is already compromising performance by not running DRS, racing on a slick surface and wet weather tires with less grip, why not mandate the teams to run ""wet weather floors"" which do away with all the ground effect stuff and the cars race with their body work downforce only? Obviously, this idea stops working in races with crossover where teams will want to get back to their normal floor... but it was nice to think about while waiting for Spa\'s delay', ""I'd rather watch 24 hours of Spa 2021 instead of some driver facing life-threathening crash""]",26,12,0.8,26,10,10,12,1,0.050000000000000044,12
