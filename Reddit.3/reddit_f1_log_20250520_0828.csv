So I’m cautious optimistic about his chances to fight for the title.', 'Putting it simple: having a better feel for balance, rear end behavior, and brake response probably gives Max the confidence to make the lap 1 move (admittedly, wouldnt put trying regardless past him at all 😉)\n\nThat aside - on this track Redbull and McLaren were pretty much on par - best evidence is the almost non-existent delta between NOR and VER after NOR clearing PIA after the safety car - similar tire age, similar fuel load, similar degree of clean air', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **All signs pointed to victory for McLaren. In the end, Max Verstappen still emerged victorious. Did Red Bull manage to turn things around and bring the wonder car to its knees with its onboard resources?**\n\n> The favorites couldn\'t be clearer. Oscar Piastri on pole position, McLaren fastest in the discipline where Red Bull and Mercedes are most feared. Hot weather and track temperatures of 45 degrees Celsius on Sunday, plus the softest tire compounds Pirelli can offer, all signs pointed to a McLaren victory.\n\n> And yet, in the end, Max Verstappen won. Just like in Suzuka. Although the track and conditions aren\'t comparable, Formula 1\'s farewell performance at Imola told a similar story. Verstappen won the start. This is even more crucial for Red Bull than for McLaren. With a clear track and a clean airflow, the RB21 almost has McLaren qualities.\n\n> Then, with the better-placed car, McLaren gambled with the strategy, just like in Japan. Piastri was brought in for a tire change on lap 13. This committed them to a two-stop race early on. McLaren underestimated two things. The hard tire wasn\'t as good as expected. And Piastri was stuck in traffic longer than expected. Although the Australian had to overtake seven cars in 15 laps, he only lost just under a second to Verstappen. This shows: The speed was there.\n\n> **McLaren loses race at the start.**\nLando Norris was already ten seconds behind after ten laps in the slipstream of George Russell\'s Mercedes when he finally managed to establish his pace. 18 laps later, it was 8.7 seconds. After Verstappen\'s VSC gift, the lead grew to 20 seconds. Norris reduced it to 18.4 seconds before the safety car 18 laps later.\n\n> The neutralization gave Verstappen and Norris a chance for a second tire change, narrowing the gap to zero, but McLaren was unlucky enough to have Piastri on old tires between them. By the time Norris had fought his way past his teammate, the train had finally left the station.\n\n> The bottom line is that McLaren was perhaps a touch faster, but never fast enough. ""The race might have had a different outcome had Oscar won the start,"" admitted team principal Andrea Stella. From then on, McLaren was on the defensive and had the choice to react or take a risk. They chose the risk and lost.\n\n> **That\'s why the heat was good for Red Bull.**\nBut why couldn\'t the McLarens take advantage of the conditions and the tire types available, as was the case in Miami? The track temperature was only 39 degrees Celsius. Yet, winner Piastri beat Red Bull and Mercedes by more than 37 seconds.\n\n> For Stella, the result at Imola was no surprise. ""Suzuka and Jeddah, like Imola, showed that this type of track suits Red Bull and limits our advantage. All tracks feature fast, flowing corners. Imola requires a completely different aerodynamic configuration than Miami. Furthermore, Red Bull made a good step with their upgrades. Nevertheless, we were surprised at the end by how fast and consistent they were.""\n\n> Red Bull technical director Pierre Waché had an explanation for why the heat didn\'t play into McLaren\'s hands on Sunday. ""On certain types of asphalt with certain tire compounds, the tire wear mechanism changes in our favor in hot weather."" The Frenchman declined to elaborate on the tire 101. ""That would give too much away.""\n\n> **Better balance enlarges setup window.**\nRed Bull has improved its much-maligned RB21 with its two-piece upgrade. The new underbody, which was already installed in Miami, delivers more stable downforce. The modified cooling intake optimizes the airflow around the sidepods, the modified rear wishbone fairings to the diffuser, and the new rear brake vents allow for better control of tire temperatures. ""But it will take time until this works as well as it does at McLaren,"" fears Sporting Director Helmut Marko.\n\n> The impact of recent developments was felt by the drivers. The Red Bull no longer changed its balance between turn-in and the apex. The understeer mid-corner disappeared, but the oversteer on the exit remained. But Verstappen can live with that. ""For the first time in a long time, Max hasn\'t complained,"" Marko said with a sigh of relief.\n\n> The champion praised: ""The car was easier to control. This made it easier to manage the tires."" Team principal Christian Horner explained that the improvements to the car expanded the setup window. Friday and Saturday were like night and day. This time, it was possible to find a good car setup and not just a half-baked compromise.\n\n> The decisive factor will be whether Imola, like Suzuka, was just a snapshot in time where the car benefited from favorable conditions or whether it will provide a better platform in the long term. Technical director Waché remains tight-lipped: ""Am I confident now? I don\'t have an answer to that. I was after Suzuka, and then we were beaten by McLaren three times in a row.""', ""It's not 'or', it's 'and'."", 'i seriously hope this was a real improvement for red bull, it would make the title fight an absolute banger if it was these 3 going at it every race', 'I think the simple answer to this question is, track dependent performance. And if RBR have been able to widen the operating window, there will be more tracks where they are able to compete with McLaren. Max is other worldly but he didn’t just make up for a 35 second deficit across a race by himself', ""Passes were surprisingly easy due to the higher than expected tire deg. Verstappen's pace was real. I think it's a 50/50 mix of an improved car and Verstappen magic.\xa0"", 'Horner did say that they made good improvements to the car over the weekend in his post race interview, but also praised effusively the move that Max put on Oscar in T1, so my guess is that they got the car reasonably closer and then the rest was Max being Max.', 'Even Yuki said the car felt better...

He certainly got fortunate with VSC, but the damage appeared to be already done. Then on the third stint, he pulled a 5-6 gap to finish the race, certainly aided by the tyre offset to Lando and Oscar, but that's a relatively large gap in 10 laps.

1kqa20i,The Stealth Winner at Imola: Pirelli,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kqa20i/the_stealth_winner_at_imola_pirelli/,2025-05-19, Discussion,"Imola this year was a great example of how good tire engineering can contribute to an entertaining race. This was obscured somewhat by the safety cars, but tire wear presented every team with interesting dilemmas, and the difficulty of the choice was highlighted by how many teams chose different strategies, or split strategies between their drivers. 

Pit stops at Imola are unusually costly, but Pirelli had tire compounds where it was difficult to decide between a one-stop and a two-stop strategy. At first it seemed like the undercut would be massively powerful, only for the mediums to come back. But as the stint went on, Albon (on a one stop) started warning the team they were taking a big risk by running those tires so long, though he was delivered by a timely safety car.

Imola is a track where it's difficult to pass, but the race would have been good even without the safety cars because everyone was worried they were on the wrong strategy, and were making difficult choices at multiple junctures, some of which jumbled up the running order in interesting ways.","['It was an easy one stop race despite the tyres being a step softer than last year. The mediums have strong pace for nearly 50% of race distance.\n\nAs Isola mentioned ahead of the race, they are thinking about introducing a gap between the compounds so that the Hard tyre is the slowest tyre at events later in the year, so that more stops of fresher rubber is quicker.', 'i disagree, the race was an easy one stopper and it wasnt even close. \n\nHalf the grid just got baited by ferrari and Leclerc into a two stopper.', '>good tire engineering\n\nmediums faster than the soft', ""Have we seen the same race?\n\nThe C6 was borderline unusable. It was so bad that it wasnt the best tyre during qualifying. The only reason C6 was used is that every team gets so many of em and only a few C5 and two C4. \n\nEven with the C5 collapsing early (if you used it during qualifying or got baited into the stop), the 2 Stop was clearly disadvantaged, even without the perfect 1 stop VSC.\n\nSo we had a soft that couldn't hold a single lap. A qualifying where you can't push 100%. \n\nA medium that was good for 25+ laps of management. \n\nA hard that was good for a 24h race. \n\nGreat tyre engineering here."", 'Without the VSC and SC it would have been a boring race where Piastri, Russell and Sainz would have suffered from their early stops/bad strategy.', 'I though the whole point of the new compounds was that they couldn’t make a 1 stop strategy work easily, you know, as max pushed easily to do it before the vsc', 'should just do away with the C1 and C2 entirely imo', 'disagree', 'Mate what are you on about.

1kqvm8p,Monaco GP Mandatory 2 Stop Rule,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kqvm8p/monaco_gp_mandatory_2_stop_rule/,2025-05-20, Discussion,"I know this has been discussed before,  for instance pitting lap1 and lap2. There are arguments that the rule won't change anything, but i think it can jumble the order significantly..

I'm thinking of a scenario which would come into play when the field stacks up behind the safety car on the 2nd lap of a safety car period. 

1. Let's say ""Team B"" chooses to pit lap 1. 

2. A safety car period occurs before first round of pit stops, FCY.  

3. The entire field obviously will pit because its FCY. (get out one of the mandatory stop) (Team B takes their 2nd pit stop as well and is still behind the whole field) 

4. The important bit is in this scenario is that the safety car picks up the field at the start of 2nd FCY lap. (field is now nose to tail)

5. On the 2nd lap following safety car, everyone (or most) would want to pit again to fulfill their 2nd mandatory stop. It would seem foolish not to do so, if you end up the only one on track who would still be required to pit after FCY then it'll be terrible. 

6. If other teams pit for 2nd time under the same FCY period, then wouldn't Team B who chose to pit lap one inherit the lead of the race? (my assumption is the field is nose to tail, so Team B not needing the 2nd stop, staying out would jump many if not all the cars even during FCY) .

Can someone poke holes in my logic? If my scenario checks out, I think a FCY before the first round of stops could significantly shuffle the running order.  ","[""The problem with pitting under safety car twice is the fact that you would lost massive amount of track position if you're the only one to do twice. If everyone does it, you begin a roulette where cars swarm the pitlane and you risk losing trackpos again for reasons like having to wait to leave the pitbox due to massive traffic in the fastlane. A bad track position costs a lot of race time at Monaco. \n\nThose who would stay out would then run long and clear those who did their 2x pitstop under SC strategy, do a conventional pitstop and emerge ahead anyway. It's just a risky strategy that I suspect only a few backmarkers would even consider."", 'The most boring GP on the calendar. Looks spectacular though!', 'What is FCY?', 'Mandatory 2 stop in Monaco would ultimately change little. The majority of the grid will follow a safe strategy, a few will get lucky/unlucky.\n\nThe cars need to be narrower and lighter to promote overtaking in low speed corners. Right now you can drive around missing 200HP and half your gearbox with no risk of being overtaken.', 'A FCY is really equivalent to a VSC not a safety car in f1.', ""What's FCY?"", 'I fundamentally disagree with random rules meant to improve the show, especially when it is to cover for the track being fundamentally incompatible with the giant cars we have today.\n\nI even disagree with DRS, while agreeing with improving the ability of cars to follow each other more closely with aero design.', 'Honestly I don’t know how much difference it will make. I just rewatched the 2023 GP and even with rain on/off so drivers pitting for wets and slicks it barely altered the order\xa0', 'Or the FIA can just admit what everyone already knows, and make it official.

1kqqrmy,A call for respect on behalf of Argentine Formula 1 fans,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kqqrmy/a_call_for_respect_on_behalf_of_argentine_formula/,2025-05-19, Discussion,"I deeply regret the inappropriate comments and insults uttered by a small group of people who, perhaps newly familiar with Formula 1, have unfairly attacked drivers and their associates who had some kind of incident or interaction on the track with Franco Colapinto.



I want to make it clear that this attitude in no way represents the feelings of the vast majority of Argentine motorsports fans, and Formula 1 fans in particular. The true followers of this exciting sport greatly enjoy every broadcast, value the talent of all the drivers, and enthusiastically support the career of our representative, Franco Colapinto, without ever resorting to disrespect or verbal abuse.



We sincerely apologize to anyone who may have felt offended by these regrettable actions, which tarnish the sporting spirit and genuine passion we feel for the highest category of motorsports.","['I don\'t think it\'s just a ""small group"" given how we have seen similar grotesque behaviour in other motorsports like Indycar and other sports like football.', 'Does Argentina have a disproportionate amount of teenage boys? Or adults with the same level of maturity?', ""Having seen what happened to Callum Illot, I feel like it's not a small group.  I even had people tell me in the wake of the Illot situation that I shouldn't be so sensitive and that was just how people act in Argentine sporting communities."", ""I think the problem is the very big difference between traditional motorsport fans and football fans. There's a group so big on instagram formed by dumbass football fans that watched their very first F1 race last year, honestly anyone who watched F1 before 2024 in Argentina is dying of embarrassment right now. I'd like to bury my head in the ground and hope these attacks never happen again."", 'I think this is a nice post, but the issue is a BIG problem, the pure numbers mean nothing, and the only way to fix it is for other Argentine fans to aggressively call bad fans out and ostracise them from the discussion. \n\nIn cricket we have a similar problem with fans from  a certain subcontinental country - and their ‘support’ just ruins it for everyone involved.', 'Nah fam, I agree it’s not all argentinians, but it’s not a small group either. This is not the first time of the first sport where this happens.', 'Appreciate your statement, I do believe it is going to take more, louder fellow countrymen pushing back and speaking out. It is a large number, came to F1 only when Franco entered, they did it at Williams, then Alpine even before in seat, then death threats, then racial slurs. All escalated. It’s going to be a long season of this if not curtailed. There’s various utube channels that claim to be Franco supporters that are nothing more than hate chambers. If he does well, they bash his team mate (Albon, Gasly) if he doesn’t do well they bash TP and even mechanics with outlandish claims. Think at this point there would be backlash for Williams if he ever were to return as this fan base goes against the new ethos. Argentine Sports/Racing Federations should speak out and folks should file complaints with utube. Alpine (Flavio, Franco) and FIA need to issue harsher statements calling out fanbase and referencing Doohan and Yuki incidents by name. Vague PR statements are rather offensive. Think FIA should fine teams for fan behavior like in other sports leagues. FIA implemented new rule at beginning of year stating negative comments lead to online abuse but it was in protection of stewards and race officials with fines for drivers and teams. Where’s the decisive action to protect drivers? Something has to change. Even with intense rivalries of past, this isn’t how F1 should operate as a brand and this should not be an acceptable new norm. It hurting drivers, they need ACTION, that includes hurting Franco’s own career.', 'I appreciate you coming here to post this. The reality is that these types of attacks are a bit more rooted in the country itself. Looking at the banters and attacks between River-Boca or any other derby/club, Ford vs Chevy in motorsports, Argentina vs Brazil/Uruguay, etc., they are far more aggressive and targeted. There is a confusion between passion and strong cultural identity with tribalism and hostility. When one of their own is attacked - even fairly - it’s seen as a national insult rather than a sporting incident. This fuels irrational defense and threats even toward the “attacker”. It’s not every Argentine - of course - but there’s a deeply embedded pattern of extreme loyalty that can manifest in harmful ways. Until there’s a broader cultural shift in how rivalry and criticism are handled then these reactions will sadly keep happening.', 'In summary, social media and echo chambers have made it easy for a “vocal minority” on instagram to hurl racist abuse at competitors in “support” for “their” driver. \n\nThis is sadly nothing new - see the extremist arms of popular drivers’ fan bases who shout vile things at one another online. The internet has made this acceptable. \n\nThis isn’t just an Argentinian fan problem. See also the racist abuse hurled at black British football players after the Euros.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is half the shit people say online they wouldn’t have the balls to say in person.']",0,125,0.41,0,104,104,0,4,0.009999999999999953,0
