You can tell he still loves the sport and follows it closely. \n\n  \nAnd honestly. I think Max showed a bit of Prost in Las Vegas. Very much played it sensibly', ""**Alain Prost's praise for the champion who has become his equal**\n\nIf he wasn't initially keen to talk, it wasn't because he didn't want to share his place on the list of four-time F1 world champions (with Sebastian Vettel), but because he didn't have the time. Alain Prost really likes Max Verstappen and has never been reluctant to speak highly of the Dutch driver for L'√âquipe. The French world champion finally agreed to give us his analysis of his 27-year-old counterpart last Sunday. Thirty minutes of Zoom interview that demonstrate the esteem, even admiration, of the 69-year-old former driver for Verstappen.\n\n**Having Verstappen as a neighbor on the prize list. Does that mean anything to you?**\n\n>Yes, sincerely. I am pleased to be in such good company. Because there are only three of us with four titles, but I remember when Michael joined me and when Lewis came through. I will not forget that Fangio was the first driver to win four crowns (the Argentinian champion was crowned a fifth time). All the same, we're among a handful of names who, without sounding presumptuous (he reflects), are out of the ordinary. We're part of history. To be a four-time world champion is a kind of pride. And Max, looking back on his career, can be proud of it. He hasn't stolen any of his crowns. You can have a bit of luck, like me in 1986, but you have to know how to provoke it and then seize it. Max is not missing anything. I remember that in 2016 during his first victory I was commentating for Canal and I promised him a bright future. He didn't disappoint me. What he's already achieved is really impressive. Verstappen is clearly unique. He is not just anyone, whether it's his personality, his character or his commitment. You can love him or hate him, but he certainly doesn't leave you indifferent. Like many great champions, he's atypical.\n\n**This crown, do you think it was the hardest for him to win?**\n\n>Only he can say. I don't know what his car was really worth. (He reflects.) And then we mustn't forget that highly controversial title in 2021. It's still very difficult to have an objective analysis. Frankly, both of them (Hamilton and Verstappen) deserved the title for the whole season. It was Max who won it in the conditions we all know. It was his first crown, and once again he went out and won it. It's always difficult to win your first crown. In fact, I remember very well what I said that evening in Abu Dhabi: from now on we'll see the real Verstappen. And we've seen him since then (he smiles). He's freed himself. He's erased his little mistakes and his impatience. He's become very, very strong. Coming back to this year, he's had to fight hard and I think he's shown some very fine things. A lot of confidence, a lot of serenity. Even when he complains, but he has always done it, he did it with less annoyance. That's the mark of a more accomplished champion.\n\n**You describe an extraordinary champion. Does he have any weaknesses?**\n\n>At the moment, it's hard to find any. I don't know what he'll do in the future, but even in terms of communication, with all the rumours with Mercedes and the worries with Red Bull, I've found him to be very solid‚Ä¶ He's good on all terrains.

While in F1 feeder series has much fewer races, a different qualification format, and not racing many tracks, I understand that money is a big problem due to logistics but many new f1 drivers are not that good because of the difference I think. ","['Most of the recent rookies have been decent. Colapinto, Piastri, and Lawson all seem to be doing fine.\n\nThe issue seems to be that there‚Äôs not as much funding for juniors under the academy structure. Red Bull used to fully fund a lot of their juniors so cutting them when they did poorly made sense because they were an expenditure. Raising up Leclerc was a cost to Ferrari as well, same with Russell with Mercedes.\n\n\nBut now sponsorship and finances are huge even in junior categories, so we get a lot of these sponsors driven guys being able to fund 3+ mediocre seasons. Teams have huge junior academies where the drivers are paying them to be associated, not the academy funding the driver. The weeding out of the less talented yet wealthy ones is lessened.', 'Money? The gap F3 F2 to F1 is mega, Moto not so much so everything is more relative and connected. I would think that‚Äôs the only reason', 'The big difference is that Moto3 and Moto2 have become ""junior categories"" only quite recently and that too not even on paper. Moto3 and 2 are their own World Championships and riders can continue in the series after winning one (in the past there have been riders who specialised riding 125/250/350cc and never stepped up to 500/MotoGP).  \n\nF2/GP2, F3/GP3, F3000, etc. have all been explicitly feeder categories for Formula 1 for decades now - they\'re not their own world championship series and their races are not Grands Prix. The current F2 is only related in name to the original Formula 2 which died in the 1980s. So the aim is there to throw these young drivers into a multitude of situations and see how they do to filter them for F1, and not have them fight for the title really. \n\nThis is why Johann Zarco is already a 2 time World Champion (having defended his Moto2 title) but George Russell is not despite winning F2 and had to immediately leave the series.  \n\nFinally it seems like there\'s also more support from Dorna to treat them as full series and also offers a path for private customer teams to start in Moto3 and then move upwards, like VR46.', 'Rookie F1 drivers struggle more nowadays because of limited testing time. F1 used to have unlimited testing, and rookies would be able to spend weeks on end behind an F1 car‚Äôs wheel, before the season started. But nowadays the amount of testing one team can get in is heavily restricted to promote an even playing field, so rookies get very little time behind the wheel, before they start their first season.\n\nThe rookies who struggle the least are usually the ones who got the most out of testing. Piastri rarely had huge errors or crashes as a rookie, and he had a bunch of testing with Alpine and then with McLaren.', ""The budget jump from F2 to F1 is close to infinite. There's a balance to achieve F2 has to be cheaper so a lot of drivers can have an opportunity, but real F1 cars are really expensive (they are almost custom made for every type of race).\n\nF2 is supposedly a spec series with all drivers having the same engine, same chassis, etc. Some teams have better budgets, and can hire better engineers, better mechanics, they have better setups, etc.\n\nF2 is an independent business from F1. \n\nEverything is money at the end."", 'Team budget is the big difference. Run a Moto3-2-Gp team cost way less than F3-F2-F1.  \nMotoGp client team cost around 10-15mil‚Ç¨, constructors team spend around 40-60mil‚Ç¨.  \nF2 team spend between 5-10 mil$ for a ""short"" season.\n\nKeep in mind that move motorbikes is way easier (cause they\'re smaller) and cheaper than move cars', 'I think your underestimating the differences between Moto3, Moto2 and MotoGP. Especially the last couple of years the MotoGP bikes have been worlds ahead of the feeder categories.', '>many new f1 drivers are not that good because of the difference I think\n\n  \nYou\'re very very wrong I\'d say instead.\n\nBack in the days drivers that would enter F1 had months if not years of testing on real F1s behind them. Now they get promoted after working only at the simulator. If on one hand it allows them to practice ""indefinitely"", on the other it does not prepare them physically.\n\nThis year Bearman got pretty much yanked out of a F2 GTA style and tied to a f1 like a toddler on a stroller and still managed to be get a point finish on a F1, which is beyond impressive. Still, his neck gave in 2/3 of the race in because f1 is just on a completely other level.', '>While in F1 feeder series has much fewer races, a different qualification format, and not racing many tracks, I understand that money is a big problem due to logistics but many new f1 drivers are not that good because of the difference I think.\n\nOne of the big criticisms of Formula 1 at the moment is that calendar is almost full to bursting. There are twenty-four Grands Prix and twenty-five has been given as the largest possible number that it could handle. This effectively means that there is a race every other week. It places enormous strain on the teams who are pretty much at the point where they need to rotate staff through races to give them time to recuperate. Formula 2 has fourteen rounds and Formula 3 has eight, which are much more manageable numbers. This is especially the case considering that in 2025, every team in Formula 2 will also be competing in Formula 3. Which means that for the eight rounds where both series race -- Melbourne, Bahrain, Imola, Monaco, Barcelona, the Red Bull Ring, Silverstone, Spa, the Hungaroring and Monza -- everyone in those teams will be pulling double-duty as they have to prepare and field five cars.']",42,27,0.81,42,128,128,6,1,0.030000000000000027,6

Now that the dust has settled in Vegas, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post-race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyze the results.

Low-effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will be deleted. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","['What a weekend for Alpine man.\n\nGasly performs a miracle and drags that tractor up to start P3 with no shenanigans, no red flags, no weird weather, no massive mistakes from anyone else, just pure pace. \n\nThe race comes. His engine blows up and shoots a hole in the fucking sidepod while his engineer tries to gaslight him into thinking it‚Äôs not happening.\n\nThey tell Ocon to box opposite Hulk, so he comes in. They don‚Äôt tell the mechanics‚Ä¶ so they‚Äôve just granted Ocon a drive through penalty through incompetence.\n\nWhat the actual fuck hahaha', 'I hate to admit it but I do enjoy the glitz and glitter of this track. The sphere and all the neon signs etc. are nice to watch.', 'Really surprised at how easily the tyres fell apart this year. We went from expecting an easy 1 stop to teams having to think on the spot - really enjoyed it.', ""Might just be me, but the McLaren seems to have lost its edge. It's the 4th race in a row where they didn't look like the best or equal best car. The changes made after Baku might have hampered them after all. Hopefully they can claw some of that performance back for next season, but I think they've reached their peak. Would be a bummer if they aren't in the race next season though. The more teams the better IMO.\xa0\n\n\nWeird to see Ferrari struggling a bit when they were expected to be favourites here. Mercedes came out of nowhere.\n\n\nI have to say I kinda underestimated what Lewis pulled off as I watched the race. He went from 10th to 2nd in a dry race, with no (V)SC or red flag and did most of the work on track. There was some good pace in that car.\xa0\n\n\nI was surprised to see Colapinto lined up on the grid. I thought Williams were out of parts, but looks like they can still keep going despite the countless crashes this season. P13 was a very decent result after starting from the pitlane. Too bad his weekend is overshadowed by his crash and what could have beens.\n\n\nWhat needs to happen for Sauber to get a point?\xa0"", ""Does anyone else feel like they massively underutilise Vegas as a location?\n\nIt feels like they need to take a lesson from Singapore on how to set up a night track on a city. For Singapore we get these fantastic shots of the city and the track still looks great, but for Vegas all we see is the huge metal barriers and lighting gantrys. Other than that one static shot where you can see the obscured casino lights on the right, the track could literally be a in a warehouse anywhere in the world. There are very few wide shots of the strip, or anything to identify the famous casinos. It all feels kind of pointless.\n\nI'm not sure what Singapore do differently but they manage to have a circuit that doesn't feel like it's litered with metal obscuring everything."", ""I feel immensely bad for Zhou Guanyu and by extension, Sauber. The timing of the final pitstop for Zhou effectively sealed the deal of finishing behind the points and I knew they weren't going to catch up by then.\n\nI am also very thrilled and proud for Mercedes this weekend. Russell had held his position brilliantly whilst Hamilton managed to solidify his performance after how qualifying panned out for him. The team should be proud of themselves for the 1-2 job well done! \n\nUnder the same vein since I am genuinely curious to know, I wondered what setup were they on, or what upgrades did they bring, because compared to the past few races, the Mercedes was one with the track characteristics in Vegas. Or am I mistaken?"", 'Can Aston Martin fans explained why they pitted Alonso in the first few laps? Is it just the soft tyres did not work out and fell apart?', 'I‚Äôve seen a few people in various places lamenting (in varying degrees of seriousness ranging from slight jest to full on complaining) that George‚Äôs win/Lewis‚Äô and Carlos‚Äô podium was overshadowed by Max‚Äôs Championship. \n\nI‚Äôm sorry, but F1 spends an entire season hyping the WDC, from the first race where we wait to see who will come out of the gates strong, to times like the last ten races where we‚Äôve heard endless drama and speculation around this title fight (regardless of how much of an actual fight it was in the end) only to immediately pretend like we shouldn‚Äôt be focusing on celebrating the guy who wins it just because he didn‚Äôt podium? Even if that person was someone dominating, like Max now or Lewis 2017-2020, they still deserve the fanfare. I think that should go for the WCC as well. I knows it‚Äôs not as prestigious, but there could be at least a little something to celebrate the team that wins. It‚Äôs what defines the story of the season after all. \n\nI‚Äôm sure the top 3 can still feel the excitement over their own results while understanding a bigger event occurred that day. I doubt they cry themselves to sleep over it if their interviews are slightly shorter than normal lol\n\nFWIW, I think F1 did a good job of still giving the podium spots their moment while giving Max his moment too. I think I would even go so far as to say they could‚Äôve done more for the celebrations, considering the prestige behind these championships. I wonder how much is organised by F1 vs the track themselves?', 'As someone who watches both Ferrari drivers\' onboards closely, I was going to write a long explanation with timestamps about how Ferrari are to blame for the poor communication between drivers, and how the team messing up their pit timings compromised their drivers... but honestly, I realized most people have already made up their minds on which ""side"" to take. People who hate Sainz will continue to hate him, people who hate Leclerc will continue to hate him too. It\'s nothing new. \n\nOn one hand, I\'m sad we\'ll be losing this pairing. They\'re my favorite teammates in F1, maybe in the entire time I\'ve been watching. But I am so over the fighting between fandoms, to the point where I just want the season to end. I\'ve seen countless comments this season about how they\'re both terrible people who don\'t deserve a seat over some dumb comments they made on the radio while they were frustrated. The drivers don\'t have all the information in the car, and they\'re driving at 300 kph while carrying the weight of their teams and fans on their shoulders. Of course they\'re going to lash out sometimes. Even the best of the best do it. \n\nI know this will all blow over in a few days, it just sucks to see everyone putting down my two favorite drivers in the name of the other. I don\'t think it\'s deep enough to warrant thinkpieces on why one of them is the worst person ever. I even had someone DM me on here and call me a fake Sainz fan, saying I should remove my flair for commenting I don\'t think complaining on the radio is a big deal, ffs. You can disagree with me, but this kind of childishness proves a lot of this discourse is rooted in fandom wars and not people actually caring about the drivers.\n\nSorry for ranting. I had to get that out of my system. The only thing I\'ll add, since I already have the links open, is that [Leclerc said](https://x.com/Cl16__FanpageFr/status/1860681739590402142) he struggled in the first stint and [Sainz said](https://x.com/CSainzNews_/status/1860625973974094022) he struggled in the middle stint. Both drivers acknowledged the other was faster than them at some points and they held each other up. Their pace data backs this up. So if I see one more ""[Driver] was faster for the entire race"" I might explode. It was, as usual, more nuanced than that.\n\nAnyway... I\'m not feeling that confident about the WCC anymore. Vegas was supposed to be a double podium. Yet despite all the drama, P3-P4 was exactly where Ferrari should be. Mathematically the WCC is still possible, but it doesn\'t seem likely. I do hope I\'m wrong. Maybe a P2-P3 is possible in Qatar with a bit of luck and smart pit strategy (let\'s put Vegas\' pit wall shenanigans into the past). Then they\'ll still have a chance in AD. But I think something like a P4-P5 is more likely, and that won\'t be enough unless they pull off an extraordinary AD. The points lost in Austria and Baku are going to haunt me forever, but oh well. All in all, it\'s been a successful season for the team and both drivers. I can\'t complain, even if I\'m disappointed. (I hope they win and this comment ages poorly. If it does, I\'ll gladly accept the shame.)\n\nThis is somewhat of an aside, but I find it interesting Leclerc is struggling so much with heating the front tires right now. I feel like this wasn\'t an issue until recently. Did the Monza or Singapore upgrades make the rear of the car more stable?\n\nAlso, how much does the engine matter in Qatar? They spend a lot of time on the throttle there, but less than Vegas, right?', ""I don't wanna comment this on his video, bc it would be mean but Illman not being looked at by Max when he got out of the car confirms Max dislikes him as much as the fans.""]",27,63,0.86,27,60,60,2,7,0.0,2

The tarmac, heat and many other things do their own part as well.

We don't have a whole lot of data for F1 cars on this circuit, especially not since ground effect came back. I've always likened it a bit to the Bahrain GP in my head except there are pretty much no low speed corners in Qatar wherears there are quite a few at Bahrain. Last year McLaren and Red Bull were much better than anyone else here but the competitive order in similar circuits has somewhat shifted and the top cars all have different strengths and weaknesses now. For example the SF23 probably had to manage like crazy last year with it's tyre gobbling tendency, but this year's car has an opposite problem which could yet be an advantage if they get the set up right.

I for one don't expect McLaren to just outright dominate uncontested, I feel like we could get a similar scenario to what happened at the US GP where McLaren were expected to dominate effortlessly only to end up losing to Ferrari of all the cars. Even the Mercedes credentials looked better than Ferrari before that race.

With Perez massively underperforming this season the WCC likely won't be achieved, it looks like they'll finish 3rd despite having a very dominant car for the beginning of the season. Max won 7/10 races, with the other placement being P2, P6 and a DNF; Checo had decent placements with 6 Top 5 finishes (4 Podiums) despite 2 DNFs in the first 10 races. Although the placements were ok, the gap to Max was huge even in the beginning of the season. Nevertheless RB didn't replace Checo despite having a history of booting underperfoming drivers - so I wondered what might've icentivized them to not do that this year.

My obvious conlusion are the aero regulations, more precisely the [restricions on wind tunnel and CFD-time](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/how-f1s-new-sliding-scale-aero-testing-rules-work-and-what-impact-they-will.pn0sG8N4A0cjbNRbdYx8a). Assuming RB finishes 3rd, McLaren and Ferrari will have 70% / 75% of the base level wind tunnel / CFD time, whereas RB will have 80%

This gives RB an advantage in development for/during next season. They have a higher chance of being able to field a strong enough car for Max to win the WDC, yet  finish lower than Mclaren/Ferrari/Mercedes in the WCC. 

They're obviously not doing this on purpose but I think they are willing to take that risk.

For other teams this is not a viable strategy but Red Bull isn't a car manufacturer that lays importance on the WCC. RB is in F1 solely for marketing purposes, a WDC is by far the biggest marketing asset in their mind.

RB loses some price money in the process, but Checo also brings in sponsorship money and is a marketing asset in Latin America which might offset their monetary loss.

tldr: RB might be willing to lose the WCC in order to have more development time and therefore a bigger chance of winning the WDC which is their biggest priority.","['The bizarre amount of sponsor money is the only reason he is still in the car', 'Biggest problem is that the bonuses of the employees depend on the constructor standings, so unless they compensate it will hurt Red Bull.

I used to work at Red Bull for a few years, and I can certainly say that a lot of people who actually build the car wouldn\'t be too keen to stick around if their annual bonuses were slashed in half (or even nulled if they place below 3rd in the WCC). And this obviously impacts the team\'s overall performance.', 'Because his presences increases sales of red bull cans and his sponsors pay money.

Do you go to many motorsport events local to you?

It doesn't guarantee that your package will be the best, but there is more to winning races than a strong car.

1gyxl88,Should Maclaren start giving Oscar more attention ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gyxl88/should_maclaren_start_giving_oscar_more_attention/,2024-11-24, Discussion,I believe that with the base Maclaren has it is really close to win both championships the next season. But I believe that they should start thinking that meybe they are closer to do that with Oscar than they are with lando. They absolutely did a good job for not treating him as a second driver. But I think they should consider him as their first driver maybe it would work great for them they didn't achieve much with lando ,"['Lando was over a second a lap faster than Oscar in clean air today.', 'Oscar needs to get to the point where he‚Äôs regularly beating Lando for that to happen.\n\nQualy H2H is 19-3 between the two. Race H2H is 15-7. Piastri has regular weekends where he‚Äôs absolutely nowhere, just like this weekend where he started P8 and finished 7th, but people only remember his excellent weekends like Baku.\n\nYou don‚Äôt declare the poorer performer the number one driver.', 'I stg people will look at interviews, see Oscar calm and collected and Lando a bit emotional or frustrated, and come to the conclusion that ‚ÄúOscar has the mentality of WDC while Lando doesn‚Äôt‚Äù. Lando is consistently beating Oscar at the moment on pure pace alone.', 'Other than your (apparent) emotional attachment to Oscar, is there anything in the data and results that bolster your claim and opinion?\n\nBoth are talented drivers and it might certainly be that Oscar develops into a future world champion. It is likely an almost equally good assertion for Lando. \n\nBut what, in your mind, does ""giving Oscar more attention"" even mean? You state that they did not treat him as a second driver. So are you thinking that they must now treat Lando as a ""second driver"" to assuage your beliefs?', ""I think Oscar needs to start driving better first. Lando isn't 70 points ahead of Oscar because they favored him. He's ahead because he was the better driver this year. Maybe 10 points were given to Lando because of favoring him."", "">But I think they should consider him as their first driver maybe it would work great for them they didn't achieve much with lando\n\nI think the Lando hate and Oscar hype has distorted some people's view of reality. Maybe Oscar will surpass Lando one day, but some people are acting as though it's already happened. Even when you account for team orders‚Äìwhich Oscar has also benefitted from‚ÄìLando is still beating Oscar in thoroughly every teammate H2H metric. \n\nOscar will be treated as McLaren first driver when he proves it on track."", 'Lololol that guy is 0,5 second slower right now.', 'Piastri first needs to find more pace', 'Yeah so they can have a driver fighting for P5-6 instead of someone who spends most of his time fighting for poles, podiums and wins.\n\nPiastri is too slow to get more attention than Lando. Lando pitted for the fastest lap and still finished several seconds ahead.']",0,97,0.23,0,1993,1993,0,0,-0.009999999999999981,0
