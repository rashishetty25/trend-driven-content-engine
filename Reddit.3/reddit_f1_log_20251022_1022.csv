We need to schedule 24 races at venues which could realistically hold F1 races, with an emphasis on races where we’ll rake in the biggest promotor fees.

Here’s what I think the nightmare calendar might look like:

**Round 1: Bahrain Grand Prix (mid March)**

**Bahrain International Circuit**

We’ll start the season off in the Middle East. Bahrain is a decent enough circuit but we’ll be racing on the dreaded ‘endurance layout’ which adds 9 corners to slow down the action and reduce overtaking opportunities. It’s the perfect way to spoil the excitement of a new season.

**Round 2: Grand Prix of America (late March)**

**Port Imperial Street Circuit**

This is a 5.1km street circuit in New Jersey which was supposed to host an F1 race starting in 2013. We know that Liberty Media desperately want to host a race in the New York metro area, so let’s pull some strings to resurrect the project. The circuit will be narrow, and the racing will be crap, but at least there will be some pretty shots of the New York City skyline.

Watch a lap on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD1B5\_3wcE0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD1B5_3wcE0)

**Round 3: Japanese Grand Prix (early April)**

**Mobility Resort Motegi**

Motegi would be a terrible venue for Formula 1. The 4.8km road course is awkwardly positioned inside an oval track, so the circuit is quite flat, it features an excessive number of hairpins, and the grandstands are located far away from the action. But if the owners write us a big cheque and promise to improve the facilities to secure FIA Grade 1 certification then we can let them host the Japanese Grand Prix.

Watch a lap on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPxY\_gmmfSk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPxY_gmmfSk)

**Round 4: Saudi Arabian Grand Prix (mid April)**

**Qiddiya Speed Park**

Qiddiya is a proposed entertainment complex in Riyadh which plans to incorporate a racetrack with elevated sections and lots of banking to make it feel like a roller coaster. I suspect that the bonkers design for this circuit will be scaled back once the developers have embezzled the project's funds. So it just becomes another boring Middle East racetrack with poor attendance.

**Round 5: Long Beach Grand Prix (late April)**

**Long Beach Street Circuit**

We’ll bring Formula 1 back to the LA area which is a great excuse to pack the paddock full of movie stars. The bumpy surface is an iconic feature of this circuit, so we won’t bother resurfacing the track, but it doesn’t matter all that much because the circuit is too narrow and short for today’s giant F1 cars. To distract viewers from the race we’ll order the TV director to cut to a celebrity every 30 seconds.

**Round 6: Buenos Aires Grand Prix (early May)**

**Puerto Madero Street Circuit**

To capitalise on the popularity of Franco Colapinto we’ll greenlight a race in Buenos Aires. I know there’s a proposal to redevelop the Autódromo Oscar y Juan Gálvez but that circuit looks too fast and too exciting. So we’ll hold our race on an expanded version of the city’s old Formula E circuit, which means that we have yet another cramped street circuit around a harbour. Let’s just hope that Colapinto is around for a long enough to help sell those tickets…

**Round 7: Chinese Grand Prix (mid May)**

**Beijing E-Town Street Circuit**

Attendance at Shanghai has been disappointing for years, so let’s shake things up and move the Chinese Grand Prix to this new street circuit in Beijing. The 4.9km circuit is essentially just a race through a business park, with eight slow 90° corners, one contrived chicane, and straights which are too short to let F1 cars overtake. We’ll leave the manhole covers loose so they can randomly destroy some cars over the weekend.

**Round 8: Russian Grand Prix (late May)**

**Sochi Autodrome**

Sochi was always a dreary circuit with no atmosphere. It’s main purpose was to help Vladamir Putin launder his reputation. So we’re going back to Sochi to help him relaunder his reputation. We’ll make sure that every driver parrots the same talking point about how “*sport brings people together*”...

**Round 9: Vietnamese Grand Prix (early June)**

**Hanoi Street Circuit**

We’ll now head to southeast Asia to give the Vietnam Grand Prix a second chance. The circuit is quite interesting with a long straights and lots of fast corners, like Jeddah. But we can ruin the circuit by making the entirety of the main 1.5km straight a DRS zone, which should make overtaking absurdly easy. Let’s just hope that we can hold the race before the new race promotor gets arrested!

**Round 10: Dubai Grand Prix (mid June)**

**Dubai Autodrome**

I actually think this circuit would be a good F1 track, which makes sense because it was originally supposed to host a Grand Prix. It’s 5.3km with two long straights and two challenging technical sections with elevation changes. But it’s yet another Middle Eastern race where we can be sure of low attendance and a tepid atmosphere. We’ll also schedule the race to clash with Le Mans.

**Round 11: Miami Grand Prix (late June)**

**Miami International Autodrome**

Miami is a decent circuit when you bear in mind that it’s just a car park with some blue paint. But to make it even more unbearable we’ll add another fake marina, we’ll bring back those cringy driver introductions from 2023, and we’ll let Trump hand out the trophies on the podium (unless he decides to keep them for himself).

**Round 12: European Grand Prix (early July)**

**Valencia Street Circuit**

This circuit was infamous for having very few overtakes during a five-year stint in F1, so it’s the perfect venue for the European Grand Prix. The circuit is quite run-down at the moment, but if we give it a fresh coat of paint I’m sure it will do fine. At least this circuit has a real marina…

**Round 13: Qatar Grand Prix (late July)**

**Lusail International Circuit**

Qatar has always been a woeful F1 circuit. But we can make it even worse by holding it on a July afternoon, which means we can expect temperatures of about 42°C. So the Grand Prix isn’t really a race, it’s more like a test to see which drivers can avoid passing out from heat exhaustion.

**Round 14: Sao Paulo Grand Prix (early August)**

**Sao Paulo Street Circuit**

Usually there’s a summer break in August to let F1 personnel have some time off. But we’re going to schedule a ‘triple-header’ in August to prevent them from spending time with their families. The action starts in Brazil, where we’ll utilise the 4.1km street circuit IndyCar used from 2010 to 2013. The circuit goes around an exhibition venue. It’s flat, it’s narrow, it’s boring – Nothing like Interlagos. Perfect.

**Round 15: Azerbaijan Grand Prix (mid August)**

**Baku City Circuit**

F1 has raced at Baku since 2016 and the fans appreciate the track for the long main straight and the tight corners which catch drivers out. So under the guise of safety we’ll add two chicanes to the main straight and another chicane on the back straight. The chicanes look awful and they turn the race into a dull procession. We can also spoil the excitement of qualifying by moving the barriers back on the exits of all the tight corners.

**Round 16: Rwandan Grand Prix (late August)**

**Bugesera International Circuit**

Lewis Hamilton’s prayers have been answered! An African government has diverted funding away from boring projects like education and healthcare and is using the money to build what the people of Africa *really* need - an international racing venue. I have no idea if the circuit will be any good, but it will be located right next to the airport to ensure that F1 personnel can spend as little time in the country as possible.

**Round 17: Australian Grand Prix (early September)**

**Mount Panorama Circuit**

Casual racing fans often say they’d love to see F1 race at Bathurst. But they should be careful what they wish for. You see, in order to accommodate an F1 race we’re going to butcher this iconic racing venue by widening the track, removing many of the tight corners and installing copious run-off areas. The result is a mess which doesn’t make a good F1 race, and the changes we’ve made spoil all the other series which race at Bathurst.

**Round 18: Kazakhstan Grand Prix (mid September)**

**Sokol International Racetrack**

Kazakhstan is home to 20 million people, but not many of them will get to see this race because Sokol Racetrack has been built in a field in the middle of nowhere. The few spectators who make the trek will be treated to a classic Hermann Tilke circuit, featuring very long straights and abundant tarmac run-off. It’s effectively a second race in Bahrain, but the promotion fee is much higher. At least fans can be grateful it’s not another street circuit…

**Round 19: Thailand Grand Prix (late September)**

**Bangkok Street Circuit**

This race will be held around the streets of Chatuchak district in the Thai capital. Unfortunately the only slot left on the calendar is late September, which is right in the middle of Bangkok’s ‘rainy season’. So there’s a good chance that the race is a complete washout. Assuming that the race stays afloat we’ll need to drum up local support for the event, so inspired by Alex Albon we’ll order every F1 driver to change their nationality to Thai.

**Round 20: Kuwait Grand Prix (early October)**

**Kuwait City Street Circuit**

Kuwait’s ‘Motor Town’ track would be a legitimately fantastic venue for F1, and it’s already certified as FIA Grade 1. So we’ll ignore that and instead hold a new street circuit in Kuwait City. We’ll race around the northern section of the city to ensure we get plenty of slow 90° corners and plenty of shots of the snazzy Al Hamra Tower.

**Round 21: Singapore Grand Prix (mid October)**

**Marina Bay Street Circuit**

Formula 1 has been racing at Singapore for eighteen years and the event makes a lot of sense when you realise its purpose is to show off the city rather than deliver an entertaining race. To make the racing even worse we’ll use the pre-2023 layout which gives us four more slow 90° corners.

**Round 22: Las Vegas Grand Prix (late October)**

**Las Vegas Convention Circuit**

The Vegas Strip Circuit is producing some good races, but it costs a lot of money and the locals complain a lot about the disruption F1 causes. So we’ll try ‘Vegas on a budget’ by staging a much less exciting race in and around the convention centre located just north-east of the strip. At least it’s better than Ceasar’s Palace…

**Round 23: Canadian Grand Prix (early December)**

**Circuit Gilles Villeneuve**

We’ll take a break in November to kill off any excitement for the end of the season. Then we’ll hold the penultimate round at one of the most beloved circuits on the calendar. The problem is that in December the average temperature in Montreal plunges to -1.2°C. So the teams will be faced with the technical challenge of keeping their cars and drivers working in the freezing temperatures.

**Round 24: Abu Dhabi Grand Prix (mid December)**

**Yas Marina Circuit**

Abu Dhabi has spoilt the finale of many F1 seasons, so it’s an appropriate venue to end our nightmare calendar. To make the racing extra dull we’ll revert back to the 2009–2021 layout, and we’ll award **triple points** for this race to undermine the significance of the rest of the season. And to be needlessly cruel to F1 personnel we’ll schedule the race for the weekend before Christmas.

1ocfwht,Championship Standings and Eliminations - United States GP,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ocfwht/championship_standings_and_eliminations_united/,2025-10-21, Statistics,"**WDC:** Despite outscoring Piastri in both the sprint and main race, Leclerc was not able to score enough to remain in contention. Russell is at risk of being eliminated next race in Mexico, if Piastri outscores him by 22 points. This would require Piastri to win and Russell to finish 9th or below.

I've added a new calculation: the best and worst possible finishing position. Interestingly, despite being 5th and 6th in the standings, the best Leclerc could finish is 2nd, while Hamilton could only manage 4th. Piastri is guaranteed to finish 4th or better, thus ensuring that he will at least tie his best finishing position (4th, in 2024). With 141 points remaining, there is considerable potential for movement towards the back of the grid, with 15 drivers being able to finish anywhere in the final 15 positions.

**WCC:** There was no change in the WCC this week, but the battle for 2nd is getting tighter, with Red Bull scoring more points than Ferrari, who scored more points than Mercedes. There is considerable potential for movement between these team next week in Mexico:

* Mercedes will retain 2nd provided they don't lose more than 7 points to Ferrari and 9 points to Red Bull
* Ferrari will retake 2nd if they outscore Mercedes by 8 points and don't lose more than 2 points to Red Bull
* Red Bull will take 2nd if they outscore Mercedes by 10 points and Ferrari by 3

There are two clear groups of teams forming: Mercedes to Red Bull, with possible finishing positions between 2nd and 5th; and Racing Bulls and below, with possible finishing positions between 5th and 10th. Williams is alone in the middle, with the possibility of finishing anywhere between 2nd and 10th.","[""Why is nobody out here talking about George's first WDC coming up??

It really highlights how Monza (or Zandvoort) were turning points in the championship race, with Max making significant gains since after a pretty steady decline beforehand.

RBR now have the better car, McLaren has stopped development,  so no improvement expected.\nPiastri and Lando are still fighting, so high chance of losing point so each other.
