Fuel corrected, he was on pole, also was 0.177 faster than Massa, having 3 laps more fuel than him (Massa made a mistake in the final corner though). \n\nHe was absolutely brilliant in the first stint, and was faster than Massa in 14 of the first 17 laps (As Massa pitted on the 17th lap of the race), despite having 3 laps more fuel than Massa. Pulled off 3 consecutive fastest laps, as Massa pitted and cut the gap to Hamilton from 8 to 4 seconds. And let's not forget, he did all of that in mixed conditions, so they were not dry at all. Also, Massa was running  3rd, just behind Raikkonen, so he has no excuse for roadblock or traffic as well. Both Raikkonen and Hamilton were left with the same set of wet tires after their stops, as they were not changed. Raikkonen conserved it better than Hamilton, and overtook him for the lead.\n\nA lot of people try to give Kubica a lot of credit for this race, but Heidfeld had 3 laps more fuel than Kubica, and still outqualified him. He was running ahead of Kubica as well, but Sauber pitted Heidfeld for the wet tires, while Kubica for the dry tires. Kubica got lucky that he pitted for dry tires at the right time, while Heidfeld had to pit after 4 laps again for the dry tires, so he lost all his advantage and dropped behind Kubica. Raikkonen pitted 8 laps after Kubica's stop for dry tires, and was only 3 seconds behind him. He had fresh tires, and with the car advantage, he would've won that race even then (In a case where Kubica got incredibly lucky). \n\nI know Raikkonen had some blisteringly quick/dominant drives in his McLaren years (Spain 2005, Monaco 2005, Silverstone 2004, France 2005 to name a few), but this one is so underrated because nobody talks about it at all.

At each step, the cars get more powerful, the races get longer, more elements like pit strategy are introduced, and you start racing at circuits that you probably haven't seen before. It also gets more competitive and more expensive.\n\nMotorsport has typically been dominated by men -- though that's not to say that there hasn't occasionally been a female driver -- so the F1 Academy was created out of the ashes of the W Series to try and get more women into the sport. F1 Academy cars are the equivalent of a Formula Regional car; Formula Regional bridges the gap between Formula 4 and Formula 3. I know it's confusing, but that's just how it is. The thinking is that female drivers can stand out in F1 Academy and that will make it easier to get into Formula 3 and from there into Formula 2.\n\nThere have been a few female drivers in these categories in the past. Sophia Floersch raced in Formula 3 in 2020, 2023 and 2024, although she won't be racing in 2025; she's moving to Indy NXT, which is Indycar's feeder ladder. Tatiana Calderon raced in Formula 2 in 2019 and 2022, although the general consensus was that she had no business being there. And Carmen Jorda raced in the GP3 Series -- the forerunner to Formula 3 -- in 2012, 2013 and 2014, but she was arguably worse than Calderon.\n\nThe challenges to getting more women into Formula 1, Formula 2 and Formula 3 are two-fold: money and talent. First of all, drivers have to be able to secure a budget to get into these categories, and we're talking hundreds of thousands -- if not millions -- of dollars in sponsorship. And then you need to have the talent to stand out and to keep standing out."", ""Because motorsports is (mostly) a meritocracy. You're good, you get ahead. You're not, you get nowhere. Connections and especially money certainly can help get ahead, but it's not enough alone. If I had to quantify it, I'd say connections/money can get you 5% there, maybe 10%. The other 90-95% is merit. If you don't have what it takes, no amount of money will help you. For example, there were Latifi and Mazepin, the two lowest rated drivers in recent history. Well, as bad as they were in F1, they were still at least top 5 in F2 with race wins. Not particularly strong results, but not unacceptably bad either.\n\nNo woman can replicate that right now and it's debatable if it's even possible. I know it's a hard pill for some people to swallow and they act like it's an attack on women, but it's not, it's just the truth: F1 requires immense strength and endurance, which are two things men are MUCH better at. Our bodies are not the same. Men are better suited for it.\n\nA woman ever comes along who can race on a top level, she will get a seat in F1.\n\nPS: there is a woman in F3, Sophia Flörsch. She might not be particularly fast, usually lurking around P18-20, but she definitely deserves respect for racing among the men instead of choosing the easy (and fully meaningless) option, which is F1 Academy. F1 Academy is lower level than regional F4s. Flörsch could absolutely decimate the entire field, she could win everything there.
