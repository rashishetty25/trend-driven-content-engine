I would think they’d have the capacity to limit comments on posts or block people / block certain phrases being said, or delete them outright. \n\nIt’s not just Lawson either, but I think he’s the latest brutal example of the social media herd and vaguely anonymous hive mind.

As someone whose favorite team is Ferrari and favorite driver is Sainz, I want to cry a little... I can't take any more rain-related pain... 😭"", ""I am really interested how Yuki will do. I honestly think he's the best fit for the seat since Ricciardo left, based around ability and qualifying speed. 2020 Perez was a superior driver, but Perez was always a wildly inconsistent, mostly dogshit qualifier. That wasn't really a big deal during the high tyre wear era as a midfielder. It didn't matter if he got knocked out in an earlier stage all the time, and with the Q3 tyre rule, it often helped vs Hulkenberg.\n\nPerez's horrible qualifying was a much bigger deal when he had a teammate who would put in on the front row every single week, it basically guaranteed he'd be in a different race to Max. I think Yuki will usually be within 5 grid spots of Max which will make a big difference to how they compare."", 'If graphene, CNTs, aerogel, and other advanced “supermaterials” were available, what could they mean for F1?\n\nWhat kind of technologies could we expect?', 'Hey folks, question about driver numbers:\nIf Max were to lose the championship this year, but it happens before the last race, does he have to return to his original number for any remaining races in this season? \nE.g. let’s say Lando bags it in the second to last race. Does Max have to race with 33 for Abu Dhabi, since he’s not the “current” champion at that point, or does he keep the 1 since it’s for the previous year and then it officially becomes Lando’s when he receives the trophy at the gala? \nJust a random thought I had. Here’s hoping as a Max fan it won’t become relevant 🤞🏻:)', 'Has it been established that Verstappen likes excessively ""pointy"" cars? (Going off Albon\'s ""maximum sensitivity"" comment and Horner\'s quote below.) I\'m wondering if Verstappen would push for this behaviour from any team\'s car, and thus would render the 2nd car practically undriveable for any other driver, sacrificing a WCC for the WDC. If you were a team principal is that a risk you would take? Or am I reading too much into Red Bull\'s issues? \n\n> ""If I think back to the beginning of \'22, we had quite a stable car but with quite a bit of understeer, which obviously Max hates.
