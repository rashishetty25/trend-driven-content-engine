1nj952b,In praise of morning warm-up: how the lost track time F1 will never bring back still appeals,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1nj952b/in_praise_of_morning_warmup_how_the_lost_track/,2025-09-17, News,,"[""Given the discussion about reverse grids for sprints, I do wonder if bringing something like this back on a Saturday might make sense.\n\nTheoretically if they want to do a reverse grid sprint, then you can't have a sprint quali session. You'd have GP quali on Friday evening which then has say the top 10 reversed for a Sprint. But then that puts you in a situation where the only F1 track action you have on a Saturday is a 25-30 minute sprint race, which to me seems pretty dire.\n\nI know Stefano hates Practice and wants to abolish it, but then they are just going to end up with so little track action through the weekend."", 'Stefano hating practice and viewership on Fridays then talking about the YouTube highlights doing good numbers, he’s turning into one of those warehouse managers you despise who’s a company man through and through and obsesses over metrics without looking at the bigger picture', 'GP Quali on Friday would also lock the cars into the parc ferme conditions from then on which is the whole reason they reordered sprint weekends to how it is now. \n\nEither the reverse grid would have to be based on some other order (top 10 in Championship) or there has to be some fundamental change in how F1 goes about the condition of cars between quali and race.', 'IMO, it’s more likely that they scrap Friday and just have two day weekends, with qualifying and the sprint on the Saturday and the race on Sunday. That way they can justify adding 5-10 more races as each weekend is shorter.', ""This feels like a likely scenario down the line. With other events taking place on Friday to activate spending on site. I've been hearing this within motorsport for the last 5 years that weekends need to be condensed, the races shorter and with less practice time. And in other forms of motorsport also more classes bundled together = fewer competing events / dates. It is only logical for F1 to walk the same route.""]",17,5,0.9,17,5,5,17,5,0.9,17
