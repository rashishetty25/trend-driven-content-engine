A new underbody is supposed to give the SF-25 a boost. The drivers hope it\'s pointing in the right direction, but doubt it\'ll be enough for McLaren.**\n\n> The unrest in Maranello was hushed up. Not a word about the fact that team principal Frédéric Vasseur and his engineers were being scrutinized, as was rumored in two Italian media outlets before the Canadian GP. Ferrari wants to answer all the doubters on the racetrack. Therefore, the aerodynamic upgrade planned for Silverstone was brought forward by one race to the Austrian GP (June 29).\n\n> The new underbody is intended to help open up the narrow window within which the Ferrari operates. This problem has been troubling Ferrari engineers since the beginning of the season. An initial underbody upgrade in Bahrain brought only minimal improvement. The Ferrari SF-25 remains a car that is difficult to drive at the limit, especially in qualifying.\n\n> According to Charles Leclerc, the third underbody version gives cause for cautious optimism: ""It\'s a significant step. Will it be enough for McLaren? I don\'t think so, because the gap is too big. Several small steps will be necessary.""

This is the mechanical part of the rescue operation. A new rear axle is intended to keep the car\'s ride height more stable within the window where the aerodynamics work.\n\n> The goal is to make better use of the tires in qualifying without having to sacrifice careful tire management in the race. Better starting positions would make things easier for Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton on Sunday. ""It\'s easier for us to manage the tires than to drive at the limit with little fuel. We lose too much time there because we rarely manage to get the tires into their window quickly enough,"" explained Leclerc.\n\n> **Criticism of 2026 cars.**\nWhile the eight-time GP winner is hoping that the second half of the season will be better than the first, he has nothing good to say about the 2026 car. Leclerc has already driven it on the simulator. ""To be honest, it wasn\'t much fun.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Currently sat in a hot taxi feeling super gutted. We were supposed to go to Maranello tomorrow on the literal trip of a lifetime from NZ which has cost us $8000 to arrange.  Our flight has been canceled so now we can't go and my friend is GUTTED.

Thank you","[""I don't know if I fully understand your question but yeah there are VIP packages that you can purchase."", 'Why not talk to airline and get a different flight arranged?
