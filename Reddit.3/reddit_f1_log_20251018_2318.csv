1o9tszf,Max Verstappen may not become WDC this year but he is going to the factor that decides who the WDC will be,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o9tszf/max_verstappen_may_not_become_wdc_this_year_but/,2025-10-18, Discussion,"Verstappen winning the championship is a long shot, but he definitely be the factor that decides whether Oscar / Lando will be WDC this year.  

Given the fact that Red Bull seem to have fixed the problem enough to keep Max close to the McLarens, this is the absolute nightmare scenario to the Papaya Rules Team.  

1. Max already knows that getting WDC is a long shot, so he can go elbows out trying to get the win and be super aggressive in starts while neither Oscar or Lando can afford a DNF.  

2. Because Max is now in the mix, the idea that a McLaren driver can get 7 points swing in a race is no longer possible. It can be as small as 3 points if Max wins to as big as 10 points if Max manages to finish 2nd.  

3. Lando could have closed the gap to Oscar in a significant way in the past 3 races of not for Max. Right now, Max has protected Oscar's lead a bit. On the other hand, with Max in the mix, if Oscar / Lando manages to win with Max in 2nd, they can can a 10 point swing.  

3. Assuming the Red Bull car is now good enough to hang in undercut range in 3rd, if McLarens are in 1-2, who does the team first? If they give priority to the lead driver, the driver in 2nd gets undercut. If they give priority to the 2nd driver to save them from undercut, then 2nd driver gets the better strategy and may even win.  

4. In case of SC / VSC and double stack isn't possible, McLaren pitwall is gonna have trouble deciding which driver to give the pitstop to. McLaren don't do well under pressure where they have to choose between the drivers. This can lead to a lot of surprise turn of events.  

5. Also, the mental pressure that Max brings is going to affect the McLaren drivers. In quali, in race, they don't just have to worry about their own race and strategy, they will also have to worry about Max's.  

I am not definitely saying Max won't win the WDC. He clawed 40 points since summer break to the championship leader and if there is one driver on the grid I trust to achieve this kind of recovery, it's Red Bull + GP + Max combo. However, there isn't enough races left to perform miracles like winning every race without a clear car advantage and/or without any kind of double DNFs from McLarens.   

However, Max can do what he did to make us all say ""Thank god for Max Verstappen"" during Mercedes era: be a menace on track, fight for wins and podiums, do another HAM-VER-BOT rendition, and be a headache to the team that's on top.

1oa4sqv,It was a racing incident.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1oa4sqv/it_was_a_racing_incident/,2025-10-18, Discussion,"So the divers involved in the T1 crash are Alonso, H√ºlkenberg, Piastri and Norris. 

Norris gets a bad start, Piastri gets alongside him, Norris brakes late into T1 so Piastri goes for the switchback and colides with H√ºlkenberg which results in the multi car crash.

1. Lando is completly innocent the only thing he did is having a bad start which puts Oscar in the positon of a switchback.

2. I also would say Oscar is innocent he leaves enough space for 1 car on the inside of T1 while going for the switchback to overtake lando. The drivers don't see a lot in these cars i would be suprised if oscar saw Nico going down his inside and he definetly didn't know alonso was on the inside of nico.

3. Nico has no fault he has to stick his nose down the inside of Piastri if he doesnt Alonso just drives past him once he's between alonso and Piastri he has nowhere to go.

4. Alonso also isn't at fault the inside is wide open and he is alongside Nico at the apex.

To summerise it's an unfortunate racing incident. The situation starts unfolding because lando had a slow start and the contact starts because Oscar goes for the switchback. With the benefit of hindsight Oscar shouldn't have went for the switchback but I think he did nothing wrong in the moment. I mean they are 4 wide at one point. (see picture)

To anyone saying oscar is at fault remember 2022 where Russel and Sainz had contact. Sainz also turned in harder than he had to and Russel runs into the side of him everyone blamed Russel for that one. Of course there are strong differences between the 2 incidents but I think you can draw some parallels. Lastly he has to go for it they are fighting for a championship and Lando is his main rival going past him also puts him in the optimal position to potentially attack Max later in the race and also makes sure that Lando can't go for the win. 

I would be interested in your opinions.","['its definitely the evil genius design of turn 1 that leaves it open for many incidents to happen like this', 'I think anyone sane would tell you it\'s a racing incident really, especially since we know F1 rules are (imo rightfully) a bit more easy on any lap 1 incident. I think that a lot of people see this incident with a ""papaya rules"" vision, because it has been the talk in the town for a few gp now, especially recently with the ""punishment"" on Norris, and if you punish Norris for what happened at Singapore (a racing incident in T3), you either remove his punishment or put one on Oscar here, but them putting the blame on Hulkenberg is kinda hilarious.', ""As far as the stewards are concerned it is a racing incident within the rules of racing. \n\nHowever. \n\nThere are places where you can put your car where it is more likely to be in a racing incident, and places you can put your car where it is less likely to be in a racing incident. \n\nPiastri put his car in a place where an incident was more likely, and the result cost both his and Norris' Championship battle against Verstappen, although chances are it won't make a difference."", ""I sim race a lot in iRacing.\xa0\n\n\nNo matter what, the concertina effect is going to bunch up all the cars in turn 1, every single time, as the person in front will stop a little past their full speed braking marker, causing the car behind to brake before their ideal marker, moving the cars back, etc. It's why it's so easy to make up places in the first couple of turns on any track because while people are being forced to brake and take the corner way differently, you might find an opening to get on the throttle WAY before they can and get ahead.\xa0\n\n\nOne of the FIRST Turn 1 lessons you start to figure out in the sim Rookie series is that leaving a car width or more open on the inside will guarantee that a car appears there. You'll have to brake because of a car ahead of you, but you've allowed someone else to not have to brake, so they'll take the opening. If you move over into the door you've left wide open, you WILL hit someone. In any T1 that can fit more than 1 car wide, you HAVE to hold your line through it or assume someone will be there. You don't have the capacity to be within centimeters of the car ahead of you and be in your mirrors at the same time.\xa0\n\n\nOscar fucked up.\xa0"", ""Racing incident because it was lap 1, turn 1.. doesn't change that Oscar is the one going for a switchback with complete disregard for everyone else.. real ''I turn now, good luck everybody else'' vibes."", 'Gonna get massively downvoted for this but,\n\n\nIf this was Norris, you guys would call for his head', 'Well said.

1. Winning everything from now til AB, and even without being his fan I can totally see him doing it, the other part of this factor is the car, looks strong, but there is high variety on the remaining tracks, Mexico's altitude, Brazil rain, ME heat, etc. Demands the car to adapt and beat McLaren car in different conditions, and that's a big ask.

2. Finishing VERNORPIA every race till AB, the arrive for a triple header decider, but people is dismissing George Russell as a factor, he have the speed and the consistency to race for the remaining podiums, and in the right conditions like Vegas low grip, Mexico altitude and brasil cold could suit the merc car, so he will be in the mix for the top points effectively affecting the McLaren points intake, and changing the outcome of the WDC.

It would be so funny if George turns into the de-facto teammate for Max after all their headbutting. Max and Red Bull need to be smart to lure George into helping them, George want the best result possible doesn't matter who wins, so if they are able to make the race dynamics  VERRUS vs NORPIA instead of a 3v1 or McLarens vs Max, while keeping Max first George second when possible,  could be key for Max ambitions for the WDC.

IF max wins all the remaining races he will end on 447 points.   
Even if this happens its in piastris hands, but just barely. With all 2nd places he wil end on 465 points - 18 points ahead of Max.  
This scenario would leave norris with a maximum of 422 points with all 3rd places.

In another scenario i wanted to see what would happen if piastri gets all 3rd places, and lando all 2nd places. This would make max the world champion with 447, Piastri with 444 and Lando with 443 - 4 points separating the top 3.   
In this scenario piastri would just need 1 2nd place finish to tie with max aswell with both on 447. This would still make max WDC with more race wins.

Ofcourse this will not happen, but the error margin for all drivers is so small at this point. One DSQ and the other 2 drivers are clear favorites. Piastri just needs to finish 3rd in every race except 2 where he needs to finish 2nd or better.
