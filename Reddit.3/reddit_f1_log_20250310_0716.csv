This begins some strategy struggles between who takes #1 spot. Charles sees it as his big moment and 2022 redemption arc. Lewis sees his final chance at an 8th Title. The battle is on.\n\nMeanwhile at McLaren, Oscar's ceiling gets realized it's truly 50/50 on Quali/Race H2H. However the strategies are still an issue as well as Zak no longer being able to reign in Oscar. Lando doesn't allow another Hungary 2.0 and they begin exchanging between P1-P5 with Lewis/Charles/Max/Lando.\n\nMercedes once again get the concept wrong compared to everyone else, George makes the best of it but overdrives the car on a few occasions and falls out of the WDC hunt. Kimi shows us he is the real deal, and repeats Max's history / rise. This involves insanely good raw pace, but also crash prone aptitude. This causes lots of drama with many worried Toto face cam's on F1TV (and future DTS).\n\nMax wins WDC in the end only winning a few races, but keeps smashing it with his consistency. Liam plays second gunner role perfectly knowing he's playing the long game before Max either rides off into sunset or goes to Mercedes (Replacing Kimi when Ferrari inevitably lures him).\n\nWCC goes to Ferrari and Fred brings glory to Italy."", 'Norris WDC  \nMcLaren WCC']",124,248,0.84,124,223,223,18,15,0.010000000000000009,18

Piastri has the talent, but he couldn't deliver every weekend last year. But when he did, he was sometimes even faster than Lando.

However, when Norris had his Singapore-level pace… nobody could catch him—except himself, almost crashing into the wall.

Can Norris handle the pressure if the car is the fastest and he has bad luck or poor performances? Or maybe we'll see Norris 2.0 with no mistakes, crushing everybody. Or maybe Piastri will get as comfortable as he was in the lower categories, where he won almost every race…

All in all, I'm very excited for the new season! Hopefully, it will be a tight season with more teams fighting for wins than just one.

","['He needs to be consistently faster than Norris, not just challenge him every now and again as he did last year.', 'If anything I think last year showed that he simply isn\'t fast enough. I was impressed with his rookie season especially how cold and calculated he is, but it seems he just lacks speed.\n\nAll the ""killer-instinct"" in the world doesn\'t help you if your teammate is consistently 10s ahead of you in the race.', ""I don't think there was any point last year where Piastri was quicker than Norris across the whole race. Maybe 1 or 2 off-weekends..? Exception makes the rule though."", ""I just don't think he has the pace. Too many races where's he's pottering about a pit stop behind Norris.\n\nLook at Baku. He made a great move on Leclerc and won the race so you can't be too critical. But then look at the pace Norris had. Norris would have dominated that race and won it much easier than Piastri did. Good, but not top tier. That sums it up."", 'No', '2007 had two evenly matched drivers, and Rosberg was not that far off Lewis.

He’s more aggressive when wheel to wheel and he doesn’t crack under pressure. None of that matters though when he qualifies behind Lando something like 75-80% of the time.  Then Lando can disappear off into the distance. \n\nIf Piastri can get that qualy ratio to something more like 50/50 then I think he’d have a great shot.

I think a general consensus with Oscar is that his flashes of brilliance are potentially a sign of a very high ceiling for him as a driver. \n\nThat said, you’re right in that he definitely has lot of improvements to make and I think that Abu Dhabi example is a strong instance of him being rattled. He’s still relatively new into F1, but going into his third season that excuse will certainly become less viable. \n\nI think 2025 will be an important season for him to either prove his critics correct or silence them, and one that will potentially shape the trajectory of his career.']",0,65,0.29,0,59,59,0,10,0.009999999999999953,0
