‚ë¥ The aftermath of Azerbaijan is where the ‚Äúfraud alert‚Äù insults against Albon began to circulate because Colapinto, on paper, out qualified him in just his second race. Completely ignoring the fact that both drivers made it into Q3 but the only reason Albon wasn't able to complete an additional lap is because his mechanics left a cooling fan atop his car. Despite this, Colapinto still finished the race behind Albon and has yet to still out-qualify him sans extenuating circumstances.

‚ëµ Albon was forced to retire after lap 5 due to cooling/PU issue.

‚ë∂ Bottas collided with Albon, damaging Albon's front wing and diffuser. They were able to fix his wing at a premature pitstop but could do nothing about diffuser that cost him the race.

‚ë∑ Albon was caught in a lap 1 racing incident with Gasly and Tsunoda. Colapinto would receive a 10 second time penalty and 2 penalty points for his incident with Liam Lawson.

‚ë∏ Albon had a crash due in qualifying due to an engine failure that yes, James Vowles later confirmed was true. The damage being extensive enough that he was unable to start the race at all. Colapinto would crash in qualifying and later in the race behind a safety car.

**COMMENTARY**



Many have said that Alex is ‚Äúfeeling the pressure‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing outperformed‚Äù by Franco which is why I thought it importent to outline the outcome of all races involving them because neither of these things are true and I feel as if Alex Albon is being unfairly maligned by those who seemingly begin watching the sport last night. Colopinto: 

‚Ä¢ has yet to out-qualify ALB by his own merit. 

‚Ä¢ has been unable to get into Q3 in three of his six races while his teammate has, and in each of these occasions he couldn't manage a Q2 entry either. 

‚Ä¢ has only managed to capitalize on **one** P10 point finish out of **four** of his teammates compromised races.

‚Ä¢ has racked up 2 penalty points, of which Albon & Sargeant managed to steer clear of all season.


And while we didn't include Sprints here, I want to further note that Logan Sargeant managed a higher Sprint finish this season in Miami (P10) compared to Franco's P12 finish in Austin, which is notable because the former managed to do so in a significantly overweight car.

What all of this ùò•ùò∞ùò¶ùò¥ùòØ'ùòµ mean is that Franco is a poor driver by any stretch. What it ùò•ùò∞ùò¶ùò¥ mean, however, is that the idea that Franco is a second coming of Senna who's even close to beating his teammate in all metrics is categorically false and I'll no longer be gaslit about it.

It was Albon who gave Williams their highest race & sprint finish of the season, both of which occurred ùò¢ùòßùòµùò¶ùò≥ Colopinto joined the team.

Franco came in just as Williams delivered another upgrade and so far has shown himself to be standard rookie making standard mistakes and standard bouts of promise, but by all this accounts this means that he ùò©ùò¢ùò¥ùòØ'ùòµ exceeded expectations as the metric for that would be beating his teammate, which I feel I've sufficiently shown isn't true.

I open this up for discussion but want to reiterate that the topic is not about Alex Albon's season as a whole nor an opinion on whether or not Colapinto deserves a seat. This is strictly about the rather baseless claim that's in the title.


‚Äî Points finish stats were taken from [here](https://www.formula1.com/en/results/2024/races)

‚Äî I will update this post at the end of the season and if comments are fruitful ai will then make another post to discuss all 9 of Franco's races with this post as a reference. ","[""I think we can agree that Colapinto has exceeded our expectations of him by far no? I mean he's close to Albon or at least closer than Sargeant has been."", 'For a rookie with his experience against Albon who was/is considered to be one of the more promising drivers on the grid, Colapinto is performing very very well.', ""I don't disagree and I think the pace difference between the two is bigger than some people think. However Colapinto looks talented enough for F1 and clearly outperformed Logan and Albon has also had a few mistakes since Colapinto joined. Although some of the mistakes weren't entirely Albons fault. Bearman was potentially to blame for their crash and it's possible the brakes gave up in Brazil. But he also had just done 2 purple sectors in Brazil.\n\n\nBut I don't think using terms like gaslighting and obscene really help the discourse rather than just presenting the facts\n\n\nF1 fans in general and on Reddit both suffer from recency bias and overeating the under dog. We saw this with Piastri and Norris. And like Norris and Piastri they're both good drivers still, but people tend to put one guy down to pull the other guy up. Cola is just outperfing expectations and I can understand people getting excited about it. He looks a real talent.\n\nEven though Sargent and Latifi were both bad, Alex's consistent battering of them I think is still incredibly impressive. And he only lost his qualifying streak because of the team putting a fan on the car. He'd probably like to be further ahead of Cola than he is but he also might have just had a few weekends not as his best and could bounce back again. It'll definitely be interesting between him and Sainz. I think it might be closer than some people think."", ""I think they're somewhat evenly matched but I do think it's important to note that Colapinto, with no confirmed seat next year, has absolutely nothing to lose and everything to prove meanwhile Alex may be more likely to be mindful of cost cap issues and car development going forward."", 'I think that COL has shown he is good, in 6 races he finished extremely close to ALB, and THATS the important part....nobody expects a rookie to do anything but not crash and to finish races, he has exceeded that in a way that people that dont watch too much of the sport need to put Titles for click bait.   \nTo further aggravate the situation, COL is charismatic and has won a lot of people with his attitude.   \nAll in all i think ALB should be destroying a young rookie with 0 experience, and he is not, and that makes Franco reputation go further up than maybe it would be to the eyes of so many, therefore making this phrases like out-preformed ....which i personally kind of agree in a way.

1gmnca2,[Tobi Gruner] According to our information Qatars souvereign wealth fund is set to buy a minority stake in the Audi F1 team. Talks have been ongoing for months. Audi won't give up control of the team but get fresh money for investments in Hinwil.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gmnca2/tobi_gruner_according_to_our_information_qatars/,2024-11-08, Social Media,,"['This are good News tbh. Lets Not forget that mercs stake on their Team is only 33%.', 'i‚Äôve seen this path before.', '> Formula 1 is booming worldwide. Thanks to cost caps, growing interest from sponsors and increasing income from the sale of rights, the first teams are now operating profitably. Whereas it used to be necessary to invest millions in racing, it will soon be possible to earn real money with Formula 1.\n\n> One consequence of this is that the racing teams are increasing in value. Even small teams such as Haas or Toro Rosso are now valued at over a billion euros. And because this is an illustrious circle of teams that is not so easy to get into from the outside, the trend is even increasing.\n\n> Some racing teams have started to literally capitalize on the development and sell shares. In June 2023, for example, Alpine announced that it had sold 24% of the team to a group of investors including actor Ryan Reynolds, golfer Rory McIlroy, boxer Anthony Joshua and football stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce.\n\n> In mid-September, the British website ‚ÄúSky‚Äù reported that the US investment companies HPS and Accel were planning to invest in the Aston Martin Formula 1 team. Between 20 and 25 percent of the shares are to change hands. The deal is expected to increase the valuation of the racing team to at least 1.8 billion euros.\n\n> And according to information from auto motor und sport, Audi is also on the verge of concluding a deal with an investor. The purchase of the Sauber racing team was only completed at the beginning of the year. However, because the value of the racing team has already risen considerably since the deal was concluded, Audi can now really cash in.\n\n> Rumor has it that a suitable partner has already been found. The Qatar sovereign wealth fund wants to acquire a minority stake in the new works team. The emirate already owns shares in Volkswagen and Porsche. Now the billionaire investor from the Middle East is investing its money in the premier class for the first time.\n\n> The fresh money is likely to be used by Audi to further expand the Hinwil site. Here, the increase in personnel and infrastructure has not yet been completed. The car manufacturer would therefore not have to draw on its own reserves as a result of the Qatar deal.\n\n> Audi itself did not want to confirm the sale of shares in its F1 racing team. When asked by auto motor und sport, the company merely stated: ‚ÄúWe are not involved in speculation. The team is not for sale.‚Äù However, the sale of a minority share would not be ruled out.\n\n> Even if it is not clear how high the sold share is, Audi will certainly retain control and not allow itself to be talked into decisions. According to our information, the negotiations began some time ago and are not a reaction to the current economic situation.\n\n> Managing Director Gernot D√∂llner said back in September at the race in Monza that the team‚Äôs involvement was not in question and was a long-term decision: ‚ÄúThe decision was well prepared two and a half years ago and reassessed last year. We are firmly convinced that Formula 1 and Audi are a perfect match. It is in line with our strategy.‚Äù\n\n> The deal with Qatar could also be lucrative for Audi beyond the pure investment.

He didn't put a foot wrong in Hungary 2021 when Vettel was in his DRS for 60+ laps.

The cameras zoom in excessively and are constantly moving. This makes it nearly impossible to distinguish the car from the background.

Lando entered new territory for himself this season, and while it didn't ultimately go the way he wanted it to, I think he'll come back stronger from it if McLaren can continue this momentum into 2025.

The 5-10 second penalties are a bit more fair, you either serve the penalty when you pit or you get the time added to your finish time.

1glcrbv,Full Speed Control??!,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1glcrbv/full_speed_control/,2024-11-06, Technical,"So I saw this video. It is in german but it basically says this: They are in an BMW museum in Germany. The guy in the green hoodie says in that F1 BMW car they had some FSC switch (Full Speed Control) and that using the position of the car on track, the car kept full throttle even if the driver would lift in a corner that is flat out.
I never heard of that and I couldn‚Äôt find anything online. And my gut tells me it‚Äôs bullshit. 
But maybe one of you knows more‚Ä¶

So this is the video with timestamp: https://youtu.be/NHh7W0c9j8w?si=6jtZ0Si1faKOZM0S&t=4m44s","['I believe it\'s a 2004 BMW/Williams FW26. If you look at 4:19 you can see the whole car from overhead and it\'s the only year where the nose would look like that.\n\nFor some reason BMW published a guide to the steering wheel at the time seen here: [https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/photo/detail/P0016281/williamsf1-bmw-fw26-steering-wheel-07/2004?language=en](https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/photo/detail/P0016281/williamsf1-bmw-fw26-steering-wheel-07/2004?language=en)  / Direct link to hi-res: [https://i.imgur.com/OtwVknA.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/OtwVknA.jpeg)\n\n  \nAs you can see they did have a switch called ""FSC"" but this is simply labelled as ""high speed engine braking"". I suspect the explanation in the video is a misunderstanding, I\'m not certain but I cannot believe auto throttle would have ever been allowed.', 'Maybe they meant traction control', 'That\'s the BMW Group Classic collection in one of the historical factory buildings in Munich, it\'s a pretty awesome collection.\n\nI wonder if they\'re really just describing some sort of drive by wire throttle with an adjustable limit, i.e. the driver can choose to have the throttle pedal really work with 0-95% range, then regardless of whether they are at 95-100% throttle, the throttle is treated as full open. BMW and many manufacturers offer this on their road cars today, with sport modes they adjust the throttle map to make the pedal ""feel"" more sensitive by reducing the actual range.', ""So thinking about it, I could absolutely understand a button that changes throttle map to effectively ignore a driver's foot lifting on the pedal and keep full throttle being useful for bumpy tracks. \n\nIIRC this was around the era (2000s) when F1 electronic driver aids all got a bit crazy. There was even automatic downshifting alongside TC and launch control. Overriding the physical throttle position would not have been unusual to hear."", 'That was correlated to GPS, and only worked @ eau rouge, Spa‚Ä¶', 'From the era of blown diffusers? \n\nIf I remember rightly people would be on the throttle through the corner as the exhaust was routed through the rear diffuser to generate more airflow and therefore grip. Although BMW may have been gone by then.', 'You could try on r/F1technical', ""From what I gather this is to help stop rear wheels locking.  IE, you are hard on the brakes, rears lock up and the engine hits the throttle to get the rears spinning again.  It's probably pre-emptive in a way and you might want this to happen at varying speeds and amounts.  Just like it's got 3 settings for diffs and you can control the TC as well as the yaw induced as well.\n\nIt could work in the opposite way as to how strong the engine braking itself is.  Not really sure and I could find anyone explaining the engine braking of the williams."", 'That engine was so shit that it probably did both at the same time.']",31,18,0.72,31,85,85,2,0,0.01,2
