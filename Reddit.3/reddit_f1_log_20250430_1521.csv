1kbhryv,[AMuS] That is why the wind tunnel is so important,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kbhryv/amus_that_is_why_the_wind_tunnel_is_so_important/,2025-04-30, News,,"['Translation and full article:\n\n\n> **Despite computer assistance, the good old wind tunnel is enjoying a renaissance. In the current phase of Formula 1, it is especially important that engineers can rely on the data.**\n\n> Wind tunnels should have disappeared from Formula 1 long ago. On the desired path to carbon neutrality, these massive facilities leave a significant footprint on the energy balance. Just a few years ago, there was discussion in the paddock about a complete ban on this traditional development tool. The proposal found some prominent supporters, including aerodynamics guru Adrian Newey. CFD computer simulations were intended to replace test runs with real models.\n\n> But after taking over the old Force India racing team, Aston Martin suddenly expressed interest in investing heavily in the Silverstone facility. New owner Lawrence Stroll hoped to buy a competitive advantage with a modern wind tunnel. His lobbying efforts with the FIA \u200b\u200bwere successful. Since then, there has been no more talk of a possible ban.\n\n> The groundbreaking ceremony for the new factory in Silverstone took place in September 2021. After several construction delays, the new wind tunnel has been online since mid-March. ""We\'re using it for both the 2025 car and for development for 2026. We should see the first parts from the new facility on the track soon,"" reveals team principal Andy Cowell.\n\n> **Moving with obstacles.**\nPreviously, the racing team had rented space at the Mercedes wind tunnel in Brackley for many years. The engineers can now save themselves the half-hour drive. However, according to Cowell, the transition wasn\'t entirely smooth: ""I like to compare it to two watches that show different times. How do you know which wind tunnel is producing the right results? Unfortunately, if you test the same parts in both facilities, you never get exactly the same results.""\n\n> In the future, you\'ll have to be able to rely entirely on your own tools. The team boss is convinced of the benefits of the investment: ""Our eyes have already been opened to certain characteristics of the car. We now have a clearer view. But we\'re still in the learning process.""\n\n> The two Red Bull teams, however, are still eagerly awaiting the completion of their new wind tunnel. The facility should have been completed long ago. But there were delays even during the planning phase. Newey waited until the last moment to see if the aforementioned ban campaign would be successful. Financing the new building within the company also took time. In 2023, the construction site near the factory in Milton Keynes was also changed.\n\n> Recently, however, completion has progressed rapidly. Team principal Christian Horner proudly reported that they are three months ahead of the original schedule. Those in charge hope to be able to move in during the 2026 season. However, the results on the car won\'t be seen until the 2027 season.\n\n> **Relic from the Cold War.**\nUntil then, Max Verstappen\'s team will have to make do with the old facility in Bedford. The building complex at the former Thurleigh military airfield was built in 1947, initially for aircraft aerodynamic testing. Over the years, the technology has undergone repeated modifications and upgrades to meet the specific requirements of motorsport.\n\n> Jaguar originally purchased the facility from Arrows. With the team\'s takeover, the wind tunnel became Red Bull\'s property in 2004. Horner likes to disparagingly refer to it as a ""relic of the Cold War."" While the technology inside is state-of-the-art, the exterior concrete walls unfortunately couldn\'t be modernized so easily. This has caught the engineers off guard several times.\n\n> The problem lies in the poor insulation against external temperature influences. This is especially noticeable at the end of a regulatory cycle when only minor details are at stake and reliable results are required. The Red Bull wind tunnel has too much tolerance in this regard.\n\n> ""We\'re very dependent on the weather. Depending on whether it\'s hot or cold outside, there are huge fluctuations,"" complains Chief Technology Officer Pierre Wach√©. When developing entirely new concepts, the disadvantage isn\'t quite as great. ""But when the development curve flattens out at some point, we have problems with the precision and reproducibility of the data.""\n\n> According to Horner, the system in its current form is no longer competitive: ""It was good enough to produce some fantastic cars over the years. But we can no longer conduct tests at temperatures below five degrees Celsius. And when it gets above 25 degrees Celsius, the results are unstable. Upgrade parts today rarely add more than three points of downforce. Unfortunately, half of that remains hidden in the measurement inaccuracy of our wind tunnel.""\n\n> **McLaren\'s wind tunnel helps with high-altitude flight.**\nMcLaren is already reaping the benefits of its own investments. The current upward trend is certainly also a result of the wind tunnel conversion in Woking, which will be completed in autumn 2023. Previously, technicians had to fly to Cologne for 13 years to conduct aerodynamic test runs at the Toyota development center. The decision was made under former team boss Andreas Seidl to expand the facility to accommodate models in the maximum permitted 60 percent format. A wealth of modern measuring technology was installed for this purpose.\n\n> After a year and a half with the renovated wind tunnel, it\'s safe to say the investment was worth it. The development curve was steeper than any other team. The correlation with reality is good. No team has a better success rate. ""A new facility and a lot of time in the wind tunnel alone aren\'t enough to be successful. You also need the right ideas to test. Fortunately, we chose a development direction from the beginning that had a lot of potential,"" says team principal Andrea Stella, praising his aerodynamicists.\n\n> Toyota, incidentally, was able to quickly find a new tenant for its own wind tunnel. Cadillac engineers have been regular guests in Cologne since 2024. As long as the eleventh Formula 1 team wasn\'t officially registered, the technicians were still allowed to test without the restrictions applicable to all other teams. For a long time, however, the tests were like groping in the dark. The first version of the technical regulations for 2026 was not published until mid-2024. In the months that followed, there were repeated adjustments. To this day, not all details have been clarified.\n\n> Team principal Graeme Lowdon explains the biggest problem for the aerodynamicists: ""We\'ve been in the wind tunnel with the 2026 model the longest, but we can\'t verify how well the data correlates.

The teams are all (bar Haas I think?) based in Europe, with many in the one small area in the South West of England. Even in America it seems difficult to build the connections required.\n\n\nSecondly, and this seems harder to solve, there is a requirement for basically everyone to have native profiency English and a willingness to near permanently speak it. I don't think you can relax it for safety reasons, but a say Chinese competitor might struggle to come along and staff a team with local crew.\n\n\nIf they can find a way to address either of those without compromising safety and accessibility to the general public, I think we'd see a more interesting variety of competitors."", 'The more money there is to be made the more youth programs there will be and the cheaper they will get for the actual student.

1kbbci6,Should crashing in qualifying result in an automatic DSQ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kbbci6/should_crashing_in_qualifying_result_in_an/,2025-04-30, Discussion,"I‚Äôve been thinking about how one crash in qualifying ‚Äî intentional or not ‚Äî can totally ruin another driver‚Äôs lap, especially on tight tracks like Monaco. It's such a narrow circuit that a red flag at the wrong time can wipe out chances for pole, and sometimes it feels like there's no real consequence for the driver who caused it.

What if there was a rule that said: if you cause a red flag in quali, you're automatically disqualified from the session? Or at least your best lap is deleted? It would definitely make drivers more careful and stop any ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù red flag tactics. I get that sometimes it's just an honest mistake, but the impact it has on the whole grid can be massive.

Would love to hear how others feel about this ‚Äî would it be too harsh, or is it a fair way to keep things clean?","[""It's almost always (like 99.99% of the time) a genuine mistake."", 'Not disqualification but laptime deletion.
