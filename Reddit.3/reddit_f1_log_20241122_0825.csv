- The three fastest teams at the beginning of the season were Brawn, Red Bull & Toyota, who finished 9th, 7th & 5th respectively the previous season. A bit like if we were to rock up to Bahrian at the beginning of 2026 (after the rule upgrades) & the fastest teams are Williams, Haas & Aston Martin.

- Button won 6 of the first 7, but then only scored 2 podiums (no wins) over the last 10 races.

- Teams would be competitive one race, then absolutely nowhere the next. And we're not talking like this year whereby Ferrari might win one race, then be fighting Mercedes for 3rd fastest car the next - rather teams on the podium one race then back of the grid the next.

- The three champions on the grid - Hamilton, Raikkonen & Alonso - absolute non-entities for most of the season.

- Double diffuser controversy.

- F1 on the verge of splitting into two.

- Loading spinners for ages when opening stories.
- No matter how many times I sign in, invariable some story throws up the ""Join F1 unlocked!"" screen. Easily once a week if not more.

No app is perfect, and I don't want to shit on developers. But to wait multiple seconds for page transitions to load a news story is not cool. It's not network latency; this happens regularly on my home wifi on the west coast of the US with fiber internet.

Releasing something that has some rough edges is fine, we've all shipped a turkey here and there with the intent to make it better. But this hasn't gotten better in years and it's not some niche experience which is hard to trip over.
