1ivn08y,Brazil 2006 could have been one of the best title deciders of all time,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ivn08y/brazil_2006_could_have_been_one_of_the_best_title/,2025-02-22, Discussion,"Just something that sprung to my mind: if Michael Schumacher didn‘t have his engine fail in him while leading Suzuka, Brazil 2006 would have been one the most dramatic title deciders ever. In reality, Alonso was 10 points ahead and everybody felt like it was a done deal that Alonso would clinch his second championship, as he only needed to score one point to secure it. Michael needed Alonso to not score and win himself. In this scenario, Michael and Alonso would head to Brazil 126 to 124. 2 points difference, all to play for. With this alternate scenario in mind, let‘s look at how things played out in Brazil 2006:

Qualifying: Michael suffered a fuel pump issue in Q3, leading to him not setting a lap time and thus starting from 10th. Alonso started from 4th.

Race: Michael has a good start and first lap. By the end of the SC, Michael is already up to 6th, behind Fisichella. Alonso is still 4th.  Michael tries to overtake Fisichella, but catches his front wing, puncturing one of Michael‘s tires. He has to go almost a complete lap back to the pits like that, falling down to last place in the process and almost losing a lap. Michael begins his comeback drive. On lap 10, Trulli retires, promoting Alonso to 3rd. Both Ferraris are the fastest cars in the field at this stage. In the first round of stops, Alonso jumps Raikkonen to get into 2nd place. By the halfway point, Michael is back in the top ten, having overtaken some cars on track and through pitstops. He carves through the field, overtaking Heidfeld and Barrichello. On lap 47 Michael pits for his one and only regular stop, coming out again in 8th. Alonso is in a secure 2nd place after all pit stops are completed. The recovery drive of Michael continues; 15 laps from the end he caught up to Fisichella again. On lap 62, Michael makes it stick and takes 5th from the Italian. Raikkonen ahead is slower than Michael two and three laps from the end, Michael pulls a great maneuver on Kimi to take 4th. Pushing on, Michael scores the fastest lap the following lap but unable to catch 3rd place Button. In the end, Massa comfortably wins in front of Alonso, Button finished on the podium and Michael takes 4th after one of his best recovery drives of his career. Just for perspective, he made up nearly a minute on his teammate Massa after the puncture (knowing that Massa didn‘t need to push for the whole race).

So what are the implications of this, if Suzuka went to Michael? 
Alonso wins the title by a single point, 132 to 131. Michael would have only needed to pass Button to win the championship as he would have won on countback in this scenario with two more wins than Alonso. Michael was only 4.5 seconds behind Button at the finish line. The collision between Michael and Fisichella would have been looked at very differently. In reality, it didn‘t matter too much in the end, Michael would have lost anyway as Alonso finished in the points. But in this scenario, it effectively decided the championship. Fisichella wasn‘t to blame for the collision, it simply was a racing incident, but if the stakes would have been that high, it surely would have sparked some controversy. All this would lead to such a dramatic storyline: the all-timer in his last race shows everyone that he still has a claim to be the best on the grid and would nearly take his 8th title. He comes oh so close after a masterful recovery drive but ultimately has to concede the title to the young gun who shows he can hold up in a straight fight with possibly the best driver of all time. Alonso shows great maturity and truly cements his status as the heir to Michael (as in reality). Interesting fact: had it played out that way, Ferrari would have taken the constructors title 209-203. 

Tl;dr: Just one variable, Michael Schumacher‘s engine blowing up in Suzuka, prevented Brazil 2006 from being one of the most dramatic title deciders ever. 

What do you think? How do you think Brazil 2006 would rank among the great title showdowns in F1 history if it took place under these altered circumstances?","['Schumacher would have won the race by a massive margin.\nHe recovered like 50s on Massa despite losing a lot of time in traffic.', ""I very much agree it would've been quite dramatic, but I really like the way it ended anyway. Alonso wins the title, Schumacher caps off his last title challenge with one of his best drives. All in all, a great battle between the two titans, and a well deserved win for Alonso. The lack of controversy makes it good in this case. 2006 is one of my fave seasons."", 'Honestly even considering this alternative scenario Schumacher had in my opinion one of his top 5 drives he basically lost an entire lap through the puncture he got early on, and then managed to claw back all of that time with no help from a safety car and finish fourth only 6 seconds behind Alonso and in fact only 24 seconds off Massa.', 'I was there :) “the final battle”, but yes indeed it was done deal', 'Ok, but does Kimi still go for a shit pre-race?', ""Even so I remember the tension really ratcheting up at Brazil in the last few laps. Such was Schumacher's speed, for a short time at least it felt like there was a race on. I remember a real urgency to Alonso's driving at the end, like he suddenly realised the incoming threat (albeit he wouldn't have needed to fight Michael)."", ""That R26 would be in huge trouble. For all his skills Alonso was nowhere near Schumi during the 2nd half of the season once Renault's performance advantage was ironed out after the mass-damper was deemed illegal."", 'Him finishing on P4, after almost losing a lap at the beginning of the race and without any help from safety car is pretty impressive. One of the best races from Schumi\xa0']",181,18,0.95,181,199,199,7,0,0.0,7

Have there been any prolonged upticks in form similar to Grosjean's second half of 2013?

It honestly still boggles my mind that on a grid with drivers like Hamilton, Alonso, Rosberg and Raikkonen that Grosjean of all people consistently outdrove them all in the back half of 2013 and was seemingly the only guy who could actually challenge the mighty Red Bull/Seb for wins. Was the 2013 Lotus really strong in the back half of the year, or was Grosjean in the form of his life outperforming every driver on the grid not named -ettel?

Edit: I'm probably underselling the Lotus' performance in the second half. For the record I do think it was clearly the second strongest car after the break, but that it wasn't *that* much quicker than the Mercedes and the Ferrari.","[""Lotus was the second best car in both halves of the season. Raikkonen was clearly better in the first half when the tyre management was absolutely crucial. After the change in tyres Grosjean's performance improved while Raikkonen's slipped back (although the saga with Lotus not paying him probably didn't help his motivation either). \n\nGrosjean was indeed performing at his best (although the next two seasons in a much worse car were also very solid), but I don't think he was the second best driver in F1 even in that period with Alonso and Merc drivers being better at the very least"", ""Lotus had the 2nd best car in 2013. Grosjean was driving decently in the 2nd half of the season and Raikkonen was underperforming a bit due to various issues (back injury, wasn't being paid). \n\nHowever, across 2013 overall, Grosjean was still the worst driver of the top teams."", '2013 Lotus was just a lot quicker than people originally thought. Same could be said as the 2012 lotus which I’m sure the engineers said that if Hamilton or Alonso were in, could’ve challenged for the WDC. \n\nThe car was crazy quick and great on the tyres, it was unfortunately under driven by essentially a rookie Grosjean and a Kimi who was no longer elite from 2007 and who came from a 2 year break. \n\nCoupled with the fact that Kimi was destroyed by Alonso in 2014 and comfortably beaten by Vettel from 15-18 and it’s clear he was not a top driver. Grosjean himself was never amazingly quicker than Magnussen and I’d put them both in the solid midfield category.', ""That Lotus was very fast in the later stages. Grosjean finally stopped crashing and drove the car as he should have. Raikkonen's back caused him problems and he fell off a bit and missed a few rounds.\n\nGrosjean was still the worst or second worst driver in the top 4 teams."", 'IMO, Lotus was a very strong car from 2012-2013 but the drivers at the time were meh. He just had a purple patch and the car suited him + other teams were not as competitive.', ""It was great but it felt like in the second half or the vibes was at the time that pretty much everyone had waved the white flag and full focus was on 2014 especially when Seb was winning everything it didn't even feel like the drivers you mentioned were even giving it 100% imo."", ""Lotus brought a longer wheelbase car for Monza which Raikkonen didn't seem to get on as well with. That coincided with the car being very competitive at that time (not at Monza though). Raikkonen went back to the shorter wheelbase car for Abu Dhabi and was planning to keep it before he decided to miss the final two races for surgery. Raikkonen's performance relative to Grosjean also got worse when Pirelli changed the tyres too."", 'Perez in the second half of 2020 was so much better than in the first half and maximised the result nearly all the time.', 'Shame what happened to Lotus.
