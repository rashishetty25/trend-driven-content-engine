Maybe they can squeeze another $10m out of Honda for Tsunoda too lol.\n\nLawson and Hadjar can continue to grow their confidence at VCarb and then come the following season, Red Bull can choose between them, or maybe Tsunoda if he gets it together, or maybe someone else outside the Red Bull pool if the market opens up a bit more when deciding who goes in the 2nd Red Bull seat."", 'And I thought odds were a nose dive after Horner...', ""It's interesting to try to make claims about the qualities of the cars and drivers relative to the nearly two decades that the teams have been on the grid.   \n\n\nMany people would claim that RBR is the least able to extract performance from its second driver ever. Still, Yuki is either more experienced *or* was rated initially as having a higher ceiling than all of the past decade of drivers for the lead team that never managed a win. (I.e., Rookie and early-career Yuki seemed stronger than Kvyat when accounting for proneness to dumb incidents, and Gasly, Albon, and Lawson never had a real shot). Additionally, the car itself is rarely ever the clear fastest or even challenging for it over a weekend, with Max as an incredible confounding factor in rating performance. Nevertheless, a driver able to consistently stay 2-3 positions behind Max would have them a clear second in the championship, which is better than most years of the team's history. \n\nThe Racing Bulls sit at 7th in the constructors' championship, in the midst of a very tight 6-8 and abnormally close 5-9 when the whole field is incredibly tight. Two mediocre drivers could fly completely under the radar if they only occasionally made it into Q3 as long as they weren't under constant threat of Q1 exits. However, Hadjar has had incredible qualifying form, having made only one Q1 exit and taking 16 races to do so. Lawson bounced back to have strong mid-season form after falling short of optimistic expectations in his shock promotion to Red Bull. \n\nGiven that AlphaTauri finished 7th and 6th in 2020 and 2021 when Gasly was paired respectively with Kvyat and Tsunoda, and Toro Rosso recorded sixth-place finishes in 2008 with the Sebs and 2019 while primarily driven to the points by Gasly and Kvyat--all more experienced pairings than the current duo--I think there's a strong case to be made that Lawson and especially Hadjar are proving to be some of the strongest young drivers the team has had. Now, measuring by peak qualifying result in a rain-affected session is deeply flawed, but this is just one of the many statistics that tell us how impressive the Kiwi and Frenchman are!"", 'If Albon wasn‚Äôt out in Q1 it could‚Äôve been huge for former Red Bull drivers too', 'I‚Äôm starting to believe in these Horner sabotage conspiracy theories', ""C'mon, we all know how Yuki's race is going to be.\n\nHe's gonna do fine for the first part, keeping his position, maybe gaining one, and then, during the first pit, Red Bull will call him too late or too early, and maybe some satefy car shenanigans will happen while he is in pit, and he's gonna end up in 14th or something.\n\nC'mon, we've seen that happening all year."", 'Simply lovely']",2722,80,0.99,2722,2956,2956,34,0,0.0,34

So are they supposed to come to an stop during a yellow flag now? Yes i know the flag rules no overtaking and so on, but it has always been a difference between overtaking an car that drives the same speed as you vs overtaking the one who caused the flag in the first place. And the same with the case from yesterday with Piastri, where there was a splitt second momentary yellow but he didn't slowed down while seeing the green light. 

What is the next thing they are going to drag drivers into the office for? Overtaking durin a red light because they drove past the striken car? ","[""When an infraction occurs, it is *required* to take note of it and investigate if any ambiguity remains. There is 0 reason and 0 need to be more lax with yellow- or red-flag infringements. Safety is not something you can just forego 'following the rules to the T' for due to 'it otherwise perhaps maybe inconveniencing the drivers'.\n\n>What is the next thing they are going to drag drivers into the office for?\n\nWay to be dramatic. None of them got penalized for it, so why the twisted knickers?"", 'I think it\'s more track specific. Because most of the run offs require going into reverse, there are more ""infringements"" even though drivers have no other option than driving past a reversing car. It appears the stewards this race are just being cautious and want to make sure none of the infringements are egregious and dangerous.', ""From what I could see in the broadcast, seems like a mixture of factors. Some ads are in yellow (yes, flag is anyway visible, but it surely changes a bit the perception and still driver's fault). Also, flag position in some curves and last: delays in showing them after an incident or not getting to see them when they're closer to the incident than the next flag.\n\n\nI also felt the difference with other tracks. Something to investigate rather than only the infractions."", ""just accept that you're wrong and move on."", 'I want to know what‚Äôs up with the stuff on the track.
