1ojui8q,Oscar Piastri is Scared of Flying (Probably),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ojui8q/oscar_piastri_is_scared_of_flying_probably/,2025-10-30, Is it off-season yet?,"Everyone is wondering about Oscar Piastri's dip in form. Well for me the explanation is very clear, he's scared of flying! Here is some data to back up my nonsensical theory:

Points scored at ""local"" Grand Prix:

GBR 18

HUN 18

NED 25

BEL 32

AUT 18

ESP 25

EMI 15

ITA 15

MON 15

Average: 20.11 per weekend.

  
Points scored at ""flyaway"" Grand Prix:

AUS	2

SIN 12

JPN 15

MXC 10

CHN 32

USA 10

MIA 32

CAN 12

BHR	25

SAU	25

AZE	0

Average: 15.91 per weekend.

  
As you can see, Piastri's points per weekend goes down by 4.2 points on average when at a ""flyaway"" Grand Prix. The **only** explanation for this is that Piastri is scared of flying! How else could anyone explain that dip in form? With the final four Grand Prix taking place far away from Piastri's home of Monaco, expect his performances to suffer as a result.

1ojz8x5,Championship Standings and Eliminations - Mexico GP,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ojz8x5/championship_standings_and_eliminations_mexico_gp/,2025-10-30, Statistics,"**WDC:** There were no eliminations in the WDC this race, with Russell remaining in contention. To remain in contention after Brazil, he will need to outscore Norris by 15 points and Piastri by 16. For him to win the championship, he would need to win every race from now on, and hope that Norris scores no more than 17 points, Piastri no more than 18, and Verstappen no more than 53 over all remaining races.

Despite Norris retaking the lead in WDC by one point, Piastri remains ahead in number of wins. This means that whichever McLaren scores the most points in Brazil will walk away with the lead, even if Piastri only outscores Norris by 1 point. The singular exception to this would be if Norris scores 0 in the sprint and wins the race, while Piastri wins the sprint and is 2nd in the race. In that case, both drivers would end the weekend on 382 points and tied on 7 wins. Norris would then be ahead on 2nd place countback, with 8 to Piastri's 4.

It is not currently possible for a driver to clinch before Abu Dhabi simply by winning everything. If Norris were to win everything and Piastri come 2nd in everything, they would go into Abu Dhabi separated by 24 points, making it technically possible for Piastri to win in the final race.

**WCC:** Ferrari outscored Mercedes just enough to retake 2nd by 1 point, and while Red Bull did outscore Mercedes, it was only by 1 point (I'm sensing a 1 point theme here...). This means that once again, 2nd place is on offer for all three teams:

* Ferrari needs to outscore (or score the same as) Mercedes and not be outscored by 10 or more points by Red Bull to retain 2nd
* Mercedes needs to outscore Ferrari by any amount and not be outscored by Red Bull by 9 or more points to retake 2nd
* Red Bull needs to outscore Ferrari by at least 10 points and Mercedes by at least 9 to move up to 2nd

Williams is also officially out of the fight for 2nd, and will now have to settle for a best possible finish of 5th.

^(Note: the best and worst finishing positions are rough calculations, and assume that multiple drivers can finish in the same position. Obviously this is not possible, but there are) *^(670 billion scoring possibilities in each GP)* ^(and) *^(5 billion in each sprint;)* ^(so it's not exactly practical to figure out the true best and worst positions.

He’s one of the true icons of our sport. Then he’s on the phone telling me why I should come to the team [Mercedes], and then when we finally met we had a really good conversation. He said, “You’re just like me, you’re a racer to the core.” It wasn’t until we had that meeting that those barriers came down, that the stereotyped view he may have had was dealt with. After that we would travel to races together and he’d fly us places all the time.***\n\n\n**FM: Did you educate him?**\n\n>**LH:** ***I think we educated each other. He had the best stories, and we used to laugh so much together. And he was a fighter, literally until his last breath. It was unbelievable for me to see how hard he fought. We’d send video messages to each other, and right to the end he was fighting, saying “I’m coming back…” I loved him for that.***\n\n\n**FM: What do you say to those who suggest that this extra-curricular stuff is a distraction? (referring to his off track passions like music and fashion)**\n\n>**LH:** *It’s not a question of distraction. Everyone can get distracted, one way or another.

Like Michelle Obama said, “They go low, we go high”.** Every meeting I have with a potential partner, I ask what they’re doing about impact. It will be a challenge as long as I live and there will be other fights along the way, too.*\n\n\n**FM: Do you have a full slate of upcoming projects?

I’m in the process of figuring it out but storytelling is something I’m really passionate about. **More than ever, we need inspirational stories out there, given the dark times we live in.

1ojyfub,FIA’s ADUO for 2026 power units — why it’s not BoP and what it could change,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ojyfub/fias_aduo_for_2026_power_units_why_its_not_bop/,2025-10-30, Discussion,"The FIA’s new **ADUO** mechanism (*Additional Development & Upgrade Opportunities*) is intended to prevent a 2014-style split in PU performance under the 2026 rules. Rather than BoP, everyone stays under the same regulations; if a manufacturer is clearly behind after early-season reviews, the FIA may allow **extra test-bench hours**, small **cost-cap allowances** and limited **re-homologation** paths to close reliability/performance gaps. Media reports suggest formal review points during the season, with details still being finalised with the PU suppliers. What’s your view — a sensible safety net, or interference with natural competition?","[""They'll probably screw it up but I think something *like* this is necessary."", ""In other words if anyone does fall behind early on, it'll mean just 2026. down the drain, maybe part of 2027. instead of 4 years to catch up"", ""I don't think anyone is interested in a 2014 style split again, so I can only see it as a good thing."", ""It has received a few more significant changes with the latest regulations update, which i think makes it a very powerful tool.\n\nOn top of the regular update schedule, it basically now allows manufacturers to introduce 1 to 2 greatly reworked PU designs during the season the status is granted, and the subsequent season, depending on how far back they are. The number of parts eligible for ADUO has also been expanded a lot and now includes most of MGU-K, ES and CE. Only drawback is that they now have to combine all changes into one package.\n\nThe threshold has also been changed, although I dont know exactly in what way. Instead of 3% down on average ICE power, it is now 2% down on the ICE performance index, but their methodology to calculate this isnt public, I think. So I dont know if it's ultimately lower than it was before. There are then further benefits for every additional 2% deficit up to >8%, which is quite a lot. I am kind of wondering who lobbied for some of these changes in the latest ruleset. The new reliability allowance in the cost cap also considers some extremely high numbers in terms of components used.\n\nI am not sure yet what to make of all of this. With the upgrade restrictions on the new PUs being the way they are, having a safety net appears necessary. They have certainly made that safety net much, much stronger over the past year, and I think it's clear that they want to keep the performance spread within a manageable window. Maybe it's too much, maybe it will be needed."", 'If someone wants to read up on AUDO: https://www.motorsportweek.com/2025/10/17/fia-authorises-change-to-discourage-2026-f1-rules-concern/', 'Or Some one is going to Sandbag the first races…', 'Isn’t this basically just concessions from MotoGP?', ""I've always been of the opinion that you should not punish the successful teams in motorsport by kneecapping them, but instead you should give the weaker teams opportunities to catch up. That's why I do not like the Balance of Performance in WEC or the sliding scale for aerodynamics in F1.\n\nThe ADUO system seems like a much better way to handle things. It remains to be seen how it will work in the real world, but on paper it sounds like music to my ears. I wish F1 would adopt a similar system for aero development, where all 10 teams start with the same amound of wind tunnel runs and CFD allocations rather than pre-emptively kneecapping teams by taking away up to 30% of the baseline wind tunnel and CFD opportunities simply because they built a good car."", 'Why all these charades?
