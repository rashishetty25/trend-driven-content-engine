1o35wd0,"“ The next morning I was in the shower and I collapsed. I was peeing red , That was not great ! ” Esteban Ocon reflects on the most violent crash of his F1 career so far",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o35wd0/the_next_morning_i_was_in_the_shower_and_i/,2025-10-10, Quotes,,"[""Ocon's crash exposed a glaring safety issue that most newer street tracks appear to have (edit: I can think of at least one corner in each of the new street circuits that has the potential to cause a bad accident). I always questioned how tracks like Miami and *especially* Jeddah got approved by the FIA when their construction ended mere weeks before their scheduled races.\n\nThe latter's case is especially baffling, that whole track is made of high-speed blind corners, several of them with nothing except concrete barriers like the one shown above. That track is legitimately dangerous, and I think it's a disaster waiting to happen, especially on feeder series races."", 'I see Ocon is a man of class who also pees in the shower', ""I remember this crash vividly. You know why? \n\nBecause the f@@king FIA was busy pestering Lewis for his f@@king nose piercing!!!😡\n\nThe seriousness of this crash into a concrete wall wasn't even addressed."", '>“I took 42G – for people who want to see that crash, it’s not that impressive, but I hit a concrete wall.

I managed, starting from last, to finish eighth in that race. I was peeing red, that was not great!”\n\nI have nothing against Ocon, but participating in a 2h race in an F1 car **the same day** he had balance issues and was pissing blood is the dumbest, most irresponsible things I\'ve heard in a while.', 'Did he have beets the night before?\n\nBecause I want to share a very important public service announcement that if you eat beets and then pee/shit red you do NOT necessarily have internal bleeding.\n\nRelax, you good 😏', ""This is why I don't like that all the newer street circuits are bare concrete. It has very little energy absorption capability, so hit it at the wrong angle and/or where it's unprotected and the impact is really really nasty.\n\nArmco is less practical (has to be bolted down, sometimes has to be repaired after an impact), but deforms significantly to dissipate more energy. I'll take that any day on the sort of high speed street circuits we're seeing more and more of."", 'super safe race track that one', ""Because f1 and the FIA don't care about safety.

1o3b5xc,Championship Standings and Eliminations - Singapore GP,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o3b5xc/championship_standings_and_eliminations_singapore/,2025-10-10, Statistics,"**WCC:** McLaren's 3-4 was more than enough for them to clinch the constructors championship - in fact either drivers finishing position alone would have been sufficient to clinch the title. Not only was McLaren able to clinch with 6 races to go, tying Red Bull's 2023 record; but they have enough points that even when separating the drivers they would be P1 and P3 in the WCC (Piastri on 336, Mercedes on 325, Norris on 314).  
McLaren is also still on track to beat Red Bull's points record of 860 points. The soonest they could do so would be in the Qatar Sprint.

**WDC:** There were no eliminations in WDC, and very few changes in position.

* The soonest Piastri could clinch the title is now the Brazil GP. This would require that Norris scores no more than 30 points and Verstappen scores no more than 71 points between now and the end of the race.
* ~~If Piastri were to win everything between now and the Brazil Sprint while Norris scored 0 points, followed by Norris winning everything for the remainder of the season and Piastri scoring 0, then they would tie on points~~ *~~and~~* ~~on wins. Norris would end up winning on count-back of 2nd places, with his 7 vs Piastri's 3.~~ Ignore this, Norris would finish on 422 points and Piastri on 402. My dyslexia got me on this one, and I read them as the same number...
* If Piastri wins every GP (and scores 0 in all sprints), he would clinch in the Qatar GP, even if Norris comes 2nd in every GP and wins every sprint.
* If Verstappen were to win every race, and Piastri finished 3rd in all races, then Verstappen would win in Abu Dhabi by 3 points. Consequently, so long as Piastri finishes top 3 in all remaining races, and Verstappen has one result of 2nd or worse, Verstappen would not be able to win. Edit: This is true if the result of 2nd or worse is in a GP. In a sprint, the same would happen if he finished 5th or worse (a 4th place could tie Piastri on points, if Piastri finished 3rd in every race; and Verstappen would end up with 10 wins, beating Piastri's 7 on countback).","['Leclerc WDC confirmed', 'Whats gotta happen for Leclerc to win?
