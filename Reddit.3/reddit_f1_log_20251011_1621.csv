1o35wd0,"‚Äú The next morning I was in the shower and I collapsed.

I always questioned how tracks like Miami and *especially* Jeddah got approved by the FIA when their construction ended mere weeks before their scheduled races.\n\nThe latter's case is especially baffling, that whole track is made of high-speed blind corners, several of them with nothing except concrete barriers like the one shown above. That track is legitimately dangerous, and I think it's a disaster waiting to happen, especially on feeder series races."", 'I see Ocon is a man of class who also pees in the shower', ""I remember this crash vividly.

1o3b5xc,Championship Standings and Eliminations - Singapore GP,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1o3b5xc/championship_standings_and_eliminations_singapore/,2025-10-10, Statistics,"**WCC:** McLaren's 3-4 was more than enough for them to clinch the constructors championship - in fact either drivers finishing position alone would have been sufficient to clinch the title. Not only was McLaren able to clinch with 6 races to go, tying Red Bull's 2023 record; but they have enough points that even when separating the drivers they would be P1 and P3 in the WCC (Piastri on 336, Mercedes on 325, Norris on 314).  
McLaren is also still on track to beat Red Bull's points record of 860 points. The soonest they could do so would be in the Qatar Sprint.

**WDC:** There were no eliminations in WDC, and very few changes in position.

* The soonest Piastri could clinch the title is now the Brazil GP. This would require that Norris scores no more than 30 points and Verstappen scores no more than 71 points between now and the end of the race.
* ~~If Piastri were to win everything between now and the Brazil Sprint while Norris scored 0 points, followed by Norris winning everything for the remainder of the season and Piastri scoring 0, then they would tie on points~~ *~~and~~* ~~on wins. Norris would end up winning on count-back of 2nd places, with his 7 vs Piastri's 3.~~ Ignore this, Norris would finish on 422 points and Piastri on 402. My dyslexia got me on this one, and I read them as the same number...
* If Piastri wins every GP (and scores 0 in all sprints), he would clinch in the Qatar GP, even if Norris comes 2nd in every GP and wins every sprint.
* If Verstappen were to win every race, and Piastri finished 3rd in all races, then Verstappen would win in Abu Dhabi by 3 points. Consequently, so long as Piastri finishes top 3 in all remaining races, and Verstappen has one result of 2nd or worse, Verstappen would not be able to win. Edit: This is true if the result of 2nd or worse is in a GP. In a sprint, the same would happen if he finished 5th or worse (a 4th place could tie Piastri on points, if Piastri finished 3rd in every race; and Verstappen would end up with 10 wins, beating Piastri's 7 on countback).","['Leclerc WDC confirmed', 'Whats gotta happen for Leclerc to win?
