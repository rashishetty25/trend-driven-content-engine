1ozthtr,Engineers terrified by 2026: but what has the FIA done?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ozthtr/engineers_terrified_by_2026_but_what_has_the_fia/,2025-11-17, News,"Translation:

With the first 2026 chassis hitting the track just weeks away, the word circulating in the design offices isn't ""excitement ."" It's ""fear . ""

The FIA has not only changed the regulations for the next era of Formula 1; it has imposed such a profound conceptual revolution that even the most seasoned technical directors admit to navigating by sight.Formula 1 Clothing

Andrea De Zordo, Haas' technical director, had the honesty to say out loud what many are thinking quietly: this is the most frightening stage of his career. And for good reason: the engineers no longer just have to design a fast car, they have to solve a complex energy equation .

The heart of the problem lies in the new philosophy imposed by the legislature. By 2026, everything, absolutely everything on the car, will be subject to energy management. The goal is to protect the battery at all costs. This has forced engineers to design schizophrenic single-seaters.

On the straights, the car must generate almost zero drag to avoid draining electrical power. In corners, it must suddenly regain maximum downforce to maintain its grip on the track. To achieve this, the FIA introduced Total Active Aerodynamics: the front and rear wings will move in unison. This is no longer just DRS; it's a complete transformation of the car's form several times per lap.

The challenge for engineers is immense: they have to simulate two cars in one. Too much downforce on the straights? The battery drains, and you become a moving chicane. Too little downforce in the corners? Lap times plummet. Finding the optimal balance point without ever having set foot on asphalt is a real gamble.

De Zordo revealed that the design of the 2026 chassis was one of the most complex projects ever undertaken, particularly because of the movable wing mechanisms which must be compact, lightweight and absolutely reliable under colossal aerodynamic loads.

For customer teams like Haas or Williams, the anxiety is twofold. They depend on the data provided by their engine supplier (Ferrari or Mercedes). However, with power units (PUs) whose behavior in terms of energy regeneration and deployment is still unpredictable, a late update to the engine design – such as a change in cooling or dimensions – can force a complete redesign of the chassis at the last minute. “So, what do we do now?” is a phrase that De Zordo admits to having uttered more than once in the face of these unforeseen events

With the manufacturing of a complex front wing taking up to eight weeks, teams postpone production until the last possible moment to refine their concepts. The result? The car that will run in testing will likely not be the one for the first race, and major adjustments probably won't be possible until the fifth Grand Prix.

In this fog of uncertainty, everyone is trying to reassure themselves as best they can. In Maranello, they're talking about a ""silent winter ,"" but feedback from Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc in the simulator is reportedly positive, with the Monegasque driver seeming more comfortable with this 2026 concept than with the current cars. Aston Martin, for its part, is preparing for the strategic use of ""MOM"" (Manual Override Mode), the power boost that will replace DRS, although Fernando Alonso has already warned that its use will be a double-edged sword.

Perhaps the most surprising approach comes from Audi. The newcomer seems to have already finalized its 2026 engine to focus on the 2027 and 2028 versions, potentially accepting to suffer in the first year in order to aim for the title at the end of the decade.Hamilton Caps

Ultimately, what the FIA has created is a 2026 season where the hierarchy is likely to be dictated not by the one with the most power, but by the one who is least afraid to dare radical solutions in a regulation that punishes the slightest energy inefficiency","[""I honestly think these regulations are going to be an absolute shitshow, but I think it's going to make for some insane technical innovation, inter-team drama and on-track shenanigans, so I'm here for it and looking forward to 2026."", ""I hope that this chaos means that no single team will just fly away from the rest of the field and that we'll see a more varied podium from race to race. I miss the days when you could see midfield teams putting drivers on the podium."", 'I don’t know, all of that sounds quite exciting actually. I’m fully aware that the odds are that one team will dominate for a while, but even then we are likely to see a ton of different solutions, some big standings shakeups, a race to converge to the better concepts and a lot of drama and Technical Directives. Fun!', ""Isn't this what every team goes through at the start of every new regulation period where make changes occur?  This feels like an article written because they don't have any major news to break.  \n  \nBreaking News:  Team's find that overhauling their designs and coming up with new concepts involves lots of unknowns about where their concept stands against competitors."", 'Whatever happens the FIA better not just panic and nuke them like they did last time. Just stay firm and make everyone figure it out', 'I for one don’t really enjoy when everyone has figured out 95% of the regs and they spend 24 race weeks trying to squeeze out the remaining 5%.\n\nI want unreliability, massive letdowns, massive improvements, unpredictability, etc.', '""Single seaters"" \n\n\nImagine if Cadillac shows up with a 4 seater sedan?', ""What are you on about?

1ozwor1,What are some F1 books you recommend?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ozwor1/what_are_some_f1_books_you_recommend/,2025-11-17, Discussion,"I'm currently reading Ted Kravitz's book ""F1 Insider: Notes from the Pit Lane"". I have also previously read Adrian Newey's ""How to Build a Car"". I recommend both of these books, great reads thoroughly in the style and personality of their self writing authors.

But I'm looking for more. I've ordered ""Unless I'm Very Much Mistaken"" by Murray Walker, ""The Mechanic"" By Marc Priesley, and ""Total Competition"" by Ross Brawn today. Came to a hair over $50 USD on Amazon AU with free shipping to me in NZ. I can't speak to how these are yet, but I do look forward to picking one up when they arrive as I think I will be done with F1 Insider by then.

Edit: I don’t gamble and don’t recommend it. Maybe I should have posted a graph from a predicted outcome model.

I posted the graph of the betting market because I think it’s a neat representation of predicted outcome and public perception. For anyone concerned that odds trends don’t represent actual predicted outcome I recommend looking into the many pure predicted outcome models. Same spike and trends in the models for the most part.
