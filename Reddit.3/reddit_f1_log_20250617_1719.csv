1ldq23r,Got lucky and went to the F1 Movie premiere last night so here are my thoughts (no spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ldq23r/got_lucky_and_went_to_the_f1_movie_premiere_last/,2025-06-17, Discussion,"Hey all, I was lucky enough to win tickets to the world premiere of the new F1 movie last night (I never win tickets so 100% felt it wasn't real until I had them that night!), and I figured some of you might be curious about how it holds up, especially as fans.

Here are my main takeaways:

1. **The racing scenes are pretty incredible.** I'm not super into action, so maybe others will appreciate this even more than me but they feel fast, raw, pretty real and completely embedded in the F1 world. You can tell they put a lot of effort into shooting on track and used a lot of actual race footage which was cool. I recognised some of the moments from the season.
2. **The Apex GP team is really well done.** It felt like they genuinely belonged on the grid. I left wanting to follow them like they were a real team, kind of like how I get invested in certain back marker teams via Drive to Survive. 
3. **There are a few unrealistic bits.** Nothing huge, but if you're a fan, you'll definitely know some moments or 'liberties' were taken for the sake of the storyline. That said, it didn’t ruin the experience for me, it was funny at times (should have at least been a yellow...).
4. **A lot of Easter eggs for fans.** There were definitely a lot of nods to F1 fans/the fandom - down to the right pets being in the paddock. I appreciated that and it’s clear the movie was made with fans in mind.

As for the premiere itself, it was definitely a cool experience, though I wish there had been a bit more for the fans. I don’t think the drivers stayed for the screening (most of the big names left after a short on-stage intro). I understand though as I guess it was more of an industry/influencer event. So overall it still felt surreal to be there, saw some F1 personalities and I feel incredibly lucky to have experienced it. Especially just being in the same room as Lewis Hamilton, that was enough ha. 

I think you'll all enjoy it and looking forward to the discussions!

Why go against Mclarens history of letting team mates race.', 'No  \nNext question', 'Translation:\n\n\n> **Lando Norris crashed into the rear of his teammate Oscar Piastri in Montreal. What impact will the McLaren collision have on the team structure? And how could Nico Rosberg possibly help Norris?**\n\n> Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once wrote the following lines in his poem ""The Sorcerer\'s Apprentice"": ""The spirits I summoned, I will not be rid of now."" After the tenth Grand Prix of the year, this sentence could almost be applied identically to the best Formula 1 team of this season.\n\n> Ahead of the Canadian Grand Prix, drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris spoke to the media on Thursday (June 12). After the first third of the season, it had become clear that Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris were likely to battle it out for the world championship title. While the competition exhibited more erratic performance, McLaren shone with consistency.\n\n> The drivers know this, too. Regarding past internal team friction in the fight for the World Championship crown, Norris wisely said, ""Something will happen at some point."" And just three days later, he put his own words into action at the Montreal race.\n\n> Norris attacked Piastri in the hairpin on lap 66. However, his rival braked later before the final chicane and stayed ahead. Norris gained more momentum on the finish straight and tried to position himself to the left of the sister car. However, there was no room because the championship leader was covering the inside lane. Norris slammed into the rear of his teammate and then into the concrete wall. His race was over, and Piastri retained his fourth place.\n\n> **""It was only a matter of time.""**\nAbout an hour after the race, team principal Andrea Stella spoke to the journalists on site. The boss of the two rivals seemed composed: ""It was only a matter of time. It wasn\'t a question of \'if,\' but of \'when.\' Now we have certainty and can say: \'Canada 2025.\' Of course, we don\'t want that at McLaren. We\'ll have to have some discussions now.""\n\n> However, the famous ""papaya rules"" are not being put under review. There won\'t be a complete ban on attacks by team orders: ""Of course, we could control everything from the command post, but we don\'t want that. That would be artificial racing. We want to give both drivers the chance to fight for positions – also among themselves,"" explained Stella.\n\n> Norris himself had already apologized for the incident in the car. He then doubled down in the press conference. ""I simply misjudged it. It was my mistake, I take full responsibility, and I apologize to my entire team and to Oscar for attempting something like that.""\n\n> As Piastri spoke to journalists in the mixed zone, Norris approached him and apologized personally with a handshake to the Australian. Stella emphasized Norris\'s behavior: ""It\'s good that Lando immediately took responsibility. He simply misjudged the situation on the track. I\'m sure he\'ll learn from this and emerge stronger.""\n\n> **Does Norris need mental help?**\nSome experts may disagree. While Piastri has made fewer mistakes this year and is also assessing situations better in most duels, Norris seems to repeatedly slip up under pressure. He already made two errors in qualifying. Piastri started the Montreal GP, which was a poor performance by McLaren standards, from P3, while Norris had to start from seventh.\n\n> The fact that the two ultimately clashed on Sunday was also due to their differing strategies. Piastri used the medium rubber in the first stint, then switched to the hard tires twice. Norris preferred to start the race on the C4 tire. The long first stint and the intermediate sprint on the medium brought him within striking distance of his World Championship rival.\n\n> But Norris\'s good race pace ultimately didn\'t help him. Last year\'s runner-up left Canada 22 points behind Piastri. As he walked through the paddock, the weight of the defeat was evident on his face. He took a deep breath and kept his head down.\n\n> **Rosberg offers Norris help.**\nFormer champion and Sky expert Nico Rosberg has often noticed the Formula 1 driver\'s ups and downs. The former Mercedes driver knows from personal experience the psychological strain of a World Championship battle. He believes Norris needs a mentor of sorts to support him off the track, like Mark Webber does with Piastri.\n\n> ""I\'ve already offered him my help and written to him. But unfortunately, he hasn\'t responded. Maybe it will still happen,"" Rosberg revealed in front of the cameras. Rosberg himself had brought a mental coach onto the team during the 2016 season. The psychological support also helped him win the 2016 World Championship battle against Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton.\n\n> Rosberg subsequently decided to retire. After three years of friction and internal battles, calm returned to Mercedes. McLaren isn\'t quite there yet. Canada was the first incident of this kind. But the ghosts themselves summoned them.', 'Team orders, people say let them race.  They race with contact, people say they need to rules.

It’s very interesting and insightful in terms of how everything is developing inside the team. \n\nIn chronological order from the video:\n\n\n- The “crisis” is partly due to underachieving expectations. At the beginning of the season, the target was the championship, and the current situation is merely fighting for podiums.\n\n- What Hamilton was referring to when he said, “there’s a lot happening in the background that I can’t say publicly,” relates to an ongoing deep restructuring of the Gestione Sportiva (GES).\n\n- Vasseur, alongside D’Ambrosio, is trying to fundamentally change Ferrari’s old management structures and has encountered internal backlash to these changes. One example is the frequency of upgrades.\n\n- Hamilton is deeply involved in this restructuring and trusts Vasseur.\n\n- They mention that Leclerc, despite delivering great results on track, isn’t taking on the leadership role in the way Hamilton is. This doesn’t mean he’s unhappy or wants to leave.\n\n- Hamilton isn’t very present in the simulator — which was expected — but this initially caused some surprise within the team.\n\n- They mention that the SF-25, while under Vasseur’s responsibility, was mostly developed by technicians who are no longer part of the team and who followed an older philosophy.\n\n- New technicians and engineers are now working under Serra’s guidance and direction.\n\n- The guys note that internal change at Ferrari is very difficult due to the Italian nature of the organization and its people. As a consequence, when things don’t go well, “bands” tend to form within the team.\n\n- Almost all of Binotto’s loyalists are now gone from the team.\n\n- There is no “upper board” or “higher-ups” interfering in team matters. John Elkann (Ferrari’s Chairman) is the one who will decide whether Vasseur continues or not.\n\n- Antonello Coletta has declined the team principal role twice when Elkann offered it, prior to Vasseur’s arrival.\n\n- Christian Horner is considered a potential replacement if he were to become available. This isn’t likely — unless Red Bull’s management no longer wants him, which cannot be entirely ruled out.\n\n- The team at AutoRacer emphasizes that the recent attacks on Vasseur are not well-founded, and much of the reporting has been vague about what’s really going on inside the team.\n\n- Vasseur has been very harsh to the Italian Press and he needs to learn how to deal with the pressure from the press. \n\n- They believe Vasseur will be renewed, and that this “crisis” is mostly a consequence of the deep changes underway at Ferrari. Ultimately, the decision lies with Elkann.\n\n\nIn summary, Ferrari is undergoing the deepest restructuring it has seen in the last few decades. The lack of results and the return to an uncompetitive and problematic car have exacerbated the difficulties Vasseur has faced in trying to restructure the team. There are a lot of changes happening, and Vasseur needs time to implement them. That said, he also needs to deliver results to Elkann and prove that what he’s doing is the right path forward.\n\n—\n\nHere’s a link to the video that I’m referencing above.

The same thing happened in Barcelona, me wanting to see Max's steering inputs during the incident with Russell, but they only show Max's rear-facing camera.

Can the geniuses at FOM please stop with the madness? If I want to see what's happening behind a driver, I'll pick the camera feed from the driver behind. It's really that simple. Stop using the rear-facing camera. The only time it should be used, even on the main broadcast, is to provide a third or fourth angle for a replay. It only causes frustration when used live.","[""They will show all the angles of the incident in Palmer's analysis. During the race, the rear-facing angle was the most logical. They can only transmit 1 camera live from each car"", 'Agree, the rear camera is overused, especially considering it has such a low FOV so whenever the drive behind does make a move you can’t see it anyway', ""> Can the geniuses at FOM please stop with the madness?

Piastri followed the racing line, or at least the line that he had been using for several laps. If he deviated from it, the stewards would have picked up on it and it would have been cited as a major reason for handing out a penalty.', 'They are limited in the number of simultaneous onboard streams that can be broadcast live, so unfortunately, the dedicated onboard feed is also the source for the world feed, and if they want to use a rear-facing shot in the world feed, they have to switch the entire onboard feed to that.\n\nThat being said, I feel like they do sometimes make questionable selections, and it regularly annoys me a lot. A simple forward-facing shot should ideally be available at all times because it is by far the most useful angle. And even with the current limitations, I am not sure it is always a good choice to have, for example, a rear shot available for the main feed at the cost of not being able to provide the front view at all. But that is the choice they have to make.', 'For yuki’s start, they used a cam that faces his front wheel.', ""Thank you, I agree completely. I've been annoyed by this for so long."", 'they should just finally integrate a 360 camera in the roll hoop like ive seen on indy car footage. and then let me choose the viewangel like youtube does.', 'Agree, rear facing camera is so utterly pointless. It totally ruins looking back incidents like you said. \n\nMaybe they will change it in 3 years time, F1TV just recently finally implemented being able to have sky commentary/other national sound + onboard feed instead of just onboard+team radio, took them years too.']",0,33,0.36,0,31,31,0,0,0.0,0
1ldlq0d,Which circuits are unnecessary from the calendar and which ones should return?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ldlq0d/which_circuits_are_unnecessary_from_the_calendar/,2025-06-17, Discussion,"With the news of the Canada circuit, I've been reminded of many circuits that aren't there and should be, and others that are unnecessary. No, Canada isn't unnecessary.

For me, Jerez, some German circuits, Malaysia and Indianapolis should return.

And those that are unnecessary are Miami, madrid (especially since there are already rumors that it has been paid for with public money, again, like Valencia) and Vegas.

There are others that I don't like in my opinion, like Interlagos, but I think I'm the only one in the world who hates it. ","[""I'd say lose Qatar over Jeddah as I prefer the Jeddah track and Abu Dhabi now kinda has some heritage to it so I'd keep that too"", 'Qatar is the worst for me, absolutely soulless track in the middle of nowhere where every corner looks the same. I would like to see Portimão and Mugello in the calendar, I thought the races there in the covid season were great. Out of yours I think Sepang would be a good one to come back, Jerez is a good track but overtaking would be very difficult in F1. The Indianapolis infield circuit is dreadful, even worse than Miami.', 'Hot take, none are unnecessary.', ""I'd like to see Buenos Aires come back. The layout used between 1974 and 1981 could still provide great racing IMO. \n\nThe contrast between the full throttle blast of the lake extension and the tight twisty infield would force teams to compromise on setup, which would in turn lead to different cars excelling in different areas of the track. Would also be fitting with Colapinto now on the grid too."", 'What do you mean by ""paid for with public money""\n\nThey all are.\n\nAnd its why Malaysia was canned. The government couldn\'t justify paying that much for it when the locals have a greater following of Moto GP.', ""For your unnecessary tracks you've listed Vegas which has had two great races, Miami which isn't the best but it has had two good races now, and Madrid which we haven't even seen an F1 car driving at yet? It really feels like people hate those tracks for the sake of hating them tbh. And how can you possibly dislike Interlagos?\n\nFor me, I'd probably get rid of Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Mexico and Imola. I'd bring back Sepang and Istanbul"", ""I don't think Jerez would be good with the current car but Sepang needs to come back yesterday I love that track"", 'Miami and Qatar ffs take those off, soul less and boring', 'It depends on how Necessary is defined.\n\nIf you ask the teams and FOM (or the current FIA leadership), it\'s necessary to have the circuits that pay or bring in the most money so they can maximize their revenue.  The middle east and U.S. races fit that bill, so that\'s why we have them.\n\nAs a fan who wants to see great wheel to wheel racing - is Monaco necessary?  Probably not, but ""tradition"" to some is necessary.\n\nIs it necessary to haul everything down to Australia or Brazil (South America) for one race at great expense?  We could run a cheaper series if we just stick to closer to base races, or closer grouped races, but might alienate those fan bases if we do.']",0,82,0.36,0,76,76,0,3,0.0,0
1ldh7fb,VCARB as a Rebull B Team,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ldh7fb/vcarb_as_a_rebull_b_team/,2025-06-17, Discussion,"Will Vcarb always just be a B team where rookies are put in before promotions to redbull or other teams? Is it a waste of grid slots?

From my understanding, each team genuinely tries to build a car/team that can be competitive in the driver's/constructors championship though it may be very difficult for some.. 

Would it even be possible for VCARB to be competitive, or would redbull genuinely just want to have them as a junior program? Could their development be limited/stunted to keep them as a B team? And if so, how is that okay?

","[""toro rosso has always been its own team trying to be competitive while being red bull's B team for drivers\n\nthe best people, resources and drivers always go to the A team so the B team won't be a top team, but they've been strong midfield contenders for quite a large part of their existence. The only team they'll never be allowed to compete against championship-wise is the main team"", "">ach team genuinely tries to build a car/team that can be competitive in the driver's/constructors championship though it may be very difficult for some..\n\nSame goes for VCarb, they try their best with limited resources. But they are also dedicated to developing young drivers/mechanics/engineers which can't be said for teams like Haas."", 'I mean, they did beat Red bull in 2008 though', ""Team Faenza has always been a relatively small team compared to Red Bull's main team. Back when it was Minardi they struggled financially. Eventually Red Bull took over that team and promised to not move the HQ. So till this day there are Italians working for VCARB. Although they now have facilities in the UK too.\n\n\nIt's a team that recruits young talents, drivers, mechanics, engineers etc. Not all of them go to Red Bull, some even go to Ferrari or other teams."", '>Would it even be possible for VCARB to be competitive\n\nShared P6 in the constructors but ok.', 'It’s a bit of a history…\n\nThey started it for two reasons. \n- they were developing drivers and the switching next to DC didn’t work\n- RB had an ongoing contract with Cosworth and they wanted Ferrari engines (and Minardi just had a deal with them). Benetton played the same trick with Ligier in 1995 by the way. \n\nWelcome extras: extra voice at the table and more power (voting rights, money)\n\nExtra extra welcome: year development of the Honda PU before it went into the big team\n\nWith that prize money and the shared services that they are allowed to have, I think they make good money on VCARB. \n\nThey flip a bit between junior and b team. It’s what drivers they have. Now, it’s clearly the junior team where young drivers are build. Few years ago, not so much. \n\nWith the cost cap, it’s more viable for smaller teams to either sell to a big corp or build something independent themselves. Before there were clearly “couples” on the grid. \nLike, \nFerrari with Sauber and more complicated with HAAS\nMercedes and Force India and later Williams to some extent. \n\nThere is a bit of competition between Ferrari and Redbull how much the HAAS and VCARB are allowed to be one team…', ""It's quite incredible they have 2 wins (one as Toro Rosso and 1 as Alpha Tauri) in it's 20 season run under 3 names. While Sauber, in the times it wasn't owned and run as BMW, hasn't a sausage.\n\nThose wins alone make them worthy of a slot in my eyes honestly."", ""Yep, they're doing better than Aston and Alpine which is definitely a black eye for those two. Their car is a genuine midfield threat, they are doing excellent under the cost cap.\n\n\nThe engineers are all doing their best, and now on a level playing field. They will never have first pick of drivers and unfortunately we've seen them strategise to support Red Bull so they will never be WCC obviously, but in this era there's very little to hold them back.""]",0,9,0.31,0,8,8,0,0,0.010000000000000009,0
