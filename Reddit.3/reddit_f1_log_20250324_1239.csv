Let‚Äôs assume that Verstappen is (say) three tenths quicker than Lawson at this moment, intrinsically. Then add that this car is so difficult to drive that Lawson is yet to extract 3 tenths out of the car. Because he is driving this car both under and over the limit, the tyres are not in the right window, add an extra 3 tenths to that. So now you are facing almost a second of lap time difference between Verstappen and Lawson, and only three tenths of that gap is down to raw speed. The rest is about Lawson not being comfortable in the car. I know it‚Äôs just an estimate, but I don‚Äôt think that reality is vastly different. Theoretically the Red Bull is faster than the Racing Bull, but a confident Lawson in a Racing Bull is faster than a struggling Lawson in a Red Bull.\n\n>I get that the people at Red Bull say that the car is fastest the way it is set up now, but that seems a moot point if the driver is not able to extract that potential.

Do the current rules mean that every team is doing an estimate of how much rubber they will lose through a race and add some extra weight in their car? So if Ferrari's estimate is 500 grams and Mercedes's estimate is 700 grams, both cars start the race at different weights just because they estimate different tire wear?

Does it also mean that you have to add extra weight, just in case you want to go long on the same tire set in the end? So if you stay 30 laps on the same tires, you're legal, but if you stay out another 10 laps, suddenly you're not?

Does it also mean that a severe lockup or two during an intense battle can make your otherwise legal car illegal?

When someone crashes or has damage, we account for this weight loss by mounting a new part before weighing them or weighing them with the debris. I'm fairly sure the fuel also gets drained to account for different fuel use between cars. So why don't we account for tire loss when different cars will have different tire wear + drivers pick up different amounts of rubber marbles on their cooldown lap?

I understand why we can't remove the tires every time we use the weigh bridge in-session, but at the end of a race, we absolutely can afford to remove the tires and weigh the cars without them. So why don't we?

This feels really strange for a sport where we claim every gram matters... yet the weight of cars all over the grid can vary massively just on their estimate of how much tire they'll lose and also based on whether they stay long or not.","['The minimum of 800kg is car + minimum possible tyre weight when completely worn. So in any case a car is found to be underweight it‚Äôs the team‚Äôs fault.', ""> both cars start the race at different weights just because they estimate different tire wear?  \n  \nOr to read it another way - the team failed to consider their minimum weight based on their chosen strategies. They could have installed half a kg of extra ballast and they'd be fine.  \n  \nThe core rule is that car dry weight at any time during the competition shouldn't be below the set weight. This includes consideration of wear and tear components, including PU, tires or plank wear.  \n  \nOnly accidental damage can be replaced with equal specification equipment.

The answer is annoying but simple, practicality.\n\nLet's say you weigh a car without wheels, you can't do the random spot checks when they pull in from a lap.

If they're under, maybe you just over estimated their tyre weight?\n\nThis system let's them do random spot checks and uses 1 standard for everything.
