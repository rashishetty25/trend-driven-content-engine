Some interesting bits I found:
The 80’s are the only decade the UK didn’t win a title and that they have been first or tied for first in 4 of the 7.5 decades. Ironically in the 80’s every driver who won the title did so driving a British car, but none of the drivers were British. The UK in the 60’s was the most successful any nationality has been in a decade with 6 titles.

Germany were nowhere before Schumacher but since his first title they have been the most successful country with 12 titles since then ahead of the UK with 9 titles since then. Germany also were first or tied first three decades in a row from their first appearance but it’s looking like they may not even appear this decade at all as things stand.

Before 2000 South American countries were first or tied first for titles in 3/5 decades and were second in another decade, only missing out on titles in the 60’s. After 2000 however, they have failed to win a single title. It goes back further though with Senna’s 1991 title being the last South American title. No one from outside of Europe has won a title since Villeneuve’s 1997 title.

Argentina and Italy were first and second for title wins in the 50’s but haven’t won titles since 1957 and 1953 respectively. Since then however, Ferrari has won 16 constructors titles so it’s not all bad for Italy. Argentina on the other hand, hang in there maybe Franco can turn things around.

Asia is the only continent (not counting Antarctica) that has never had a driver win a title. Africa has 1 thanks to Scheckter in 1979, which also happens to be the last Ferrari driver’s championship of the 20th century, North America has 3, Australia/Oceania has 5, South America has 13, and Europe has 53. Not really close on the continent level for the most titles.

The 90’s were the most competitive decade in terms of titles per nationality, with no country having more than 2 titles. All around though the sport was more competitive as a whole from 1958-1999. In that time period no driver won more than 2 titles in a row (you can technically extend that to 2001, before Schumacher won his 3rd in a row in 2002). In fact, from 1960-1985 no driver won consecutive titles. Prost in 1986 was the first driver to retain the title since Brabham. Compare that to 2000-2025 where 4 drivers have won 4 consecutive titles, and one of those, Schumacher, won 5. In the first 50 years of the sport only 1 driver did that and now in the last 25 years 4 have done it. As much as I loved when Vettel did it, I sincerely hope this era of drivers dominating for long periods of time ends and we go back to different drivers winning the title each year. 

Finally, the most titles any driver has won in a single decade is 5 and 3 drivers have done it (Fangio, Schumacher, and Hamilton). Verstappen has this year and 4 more after it to try to become the first to win more than 5 in a decade and if he wins this year, though it seems to be getting more and more unlikely, it would guarantee the Netherlands finish the decade in at least tied first for most titles. Hamilton may not win another title in his career, (though if he wins the title with Ferrari he would be the first Brit to do so since John Surtees in 1964) but he is the only driver to win titles across 3 decades, the 2000’s, 2010’s, and 2020’s.

To anyone still reading thanks for going through my ramblings and I hope the post was enjoyable. I personally find all the stats involved with F1 fascinating and will go through them for hours. While reading stats or watching old races I’ll sometimes come upon interesting stats and then I’ll go down the rabbit hole to find out everything about that stat, so this is me sharing what I found so you guys can learn about it faster than I did. This was me just doing this from my head cause I know all the champions so hopefully I didn’t get anything wrong.

1l5ukmz,"The latest letter of support for FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem's leadership. Signed by FIA Member clubs from across Africa, including one member leader who was suspended by court order 6 months ago.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1l5ukmz/the_latest_letter_of_support_for_fia_president/,2025-06-07, Social Media,"The list of signatures is \[from MBS' instagram.\](https://www.instagram.com/p/DKnA0puoXK7/?img\_index=1) The full letter itself is from the \[FIA Vice President for Sport in Africa, Rodrigo Rocha's Linkedin\](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7333873816831528962/) as this was not included in MBS' instagram post

The suspended member is Maina Muturi who was elected president of the Kenya Motor Sports Federation back in 2023. However in late December last year, a Nairobi court issued temporary orders to suspended Mr Muturi pending the hearing and determination of a case filed by a KMSF director (And former chairman) James Kahumbura who is now acting head.

As far as I'm aware, he is still suspended although he has tried to act as leader since then, signing agreements on behalf of the KMSF that have had to be nullified by the High Court as they were made in defiance of the court order.

The latest news in regards to this I can find state:

\> *""The court has given Muturi seven days to show cause why he should not be committed to civil jail for disobeying court orders. He has also been ordered to appear in court on March 25 to respond to the contempt charges.""*

So possibly he has signed this from civil jail or more likely, the FIA needs to update their contacts list.","['Straight out of the FIFA playbook', ""This is why people need to realise he's likely going to get reelected again."", ""It's Dirty politics, I'm guessing he's gonna get re-elected soon."", 'Lmfao, only could bribe the African FIA members to vouch for him', 'Aside from a letter and a list of names, it would also be interesting to see how much money each name was given by MBS.', 'This isn’t suspicious at all', 'Really scraping the barrel, are we?', 'Gravy.
