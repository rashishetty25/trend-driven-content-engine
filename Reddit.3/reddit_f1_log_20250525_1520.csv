The commentators are wrong. The 30 second penalty for ignoring the 2nd stop is ONLY of the race is suspended and cannot be resumed. If the 2 stop rule is ignored and the race finishes at normal it will be a DQ. The same way it is for ignoring the one stop rule in a regular race.

It's incredibly frustrating to have the primary commentators on the main feed consistently be not understanding the rules, and convincing people of things that are incorrect.","['The have corrected themselves.', ""I'm watching the British sky F1 and they have corrected themselves already. It's a one off rule specific to Monaco and written in legalese to confuse everyone, mixing it up is understandable."", ""They literally just corrected themselves. Mistakes happen often, but less often they actually correct themselves. I'm thankful for them doing so in this instance."", ""they fixed the error and said that dude it's ok"", ""Yeah if it wasn't a DQ there could be some 4D chess for anyone as the last car on the lead lap but one stop still to do - they could take a 30s penalty without losing a position."", 'On Canal + they say it right', 'Did the Mercedes pit twice? Did Russel finish infront of kimi?', 'Crofty has to fix his shit.

Idk how F1 tempo gets their data but i heard they are very accurate most of the time. ","['I always wondered if the ghosts were actually accurate.', ""Honestly its pretty tricky to calculate. First of all you are converting a gps position to relative position. Then you have to project it onto the camera using the correct FOV.\n\nI also don't believe they update GPS position very frequently (maybe every 100ms?) so you are essentially getting a linear interpolation between all of the GPS points\n\nDon't forget that when the source car updates GPS and when the ghost car updates GPS is also out of sync, so you are inevitably going to have interpolation warping.\n\nIt's cool tech, but it's also implicitly inaccurate.\n\nEDIT: Oh also, the live view of the source car is not when they are calculating the relative position from the source. So even from that perspective it is out of sync.  \nThat is, what you are seeing from the onboard, is not the data they are using to calculate the position of the ghost. It's from the GPS data of the source car. If they were to project the source car GPS onto the onboard, you would see pretty large desyncs.\n\nYou know what. If I wanted to save myself a lot of work with the 3D projection, I would probably just import the relative data into a 3D box engine like Gadot/Unreal/Unity, match the FOV in engine, and render out the movement of the entity with a transparent background.  \nThen you could easily just overlay the recording on top of the onboard and you don't have to do jack shit."", ""Sorry OP, I would really love it if F1-tempo was that accurate, but it's not. I think the 3d video has slightly better data, but they're both wrong. I'm just comparing the sector times here.\n\nOn the end of the first sector (after Casino square), per F1-tempo, Leclerc is 0.05-0.1 s ahead, but we actually know that the 1st sector was 18.216 for Norris and 18.290 for Leclerc, so .074 better for Norris, which matches the video.\n\nOn the end of the second sector (after Tabac) the 3d video shows Norris quite a bit ahead, maybe 0.15s (which means Norris had the better 2rd sector), while F1-tempo shows the gap still in the 0.05-0.08s range in favour or Leclerc (so an equal second sector). The actual times show that Charles had a better sector by 0.074s (33.180 vs 33.254) and, incredibly, Norris and Leclerc were level by the 2nd sector line, 51.470s. \n\nThe third sector, per the 3d video Norris might have even been slower, given how far ahead he was entering the swimming pool section, and on F1-tempo, Norris had a 0.185s better sector. In real life, Norris was .109 faster (18.484 vs 18.593).\n\nSo yeah, none of those are very good.\n\nEDIT: TL;DR, it was more or less like this:\n\n1st sector - F1-tempo off by 0.15 for LEC, 3D pretty much right.\n\n2nd sector - F1-tempo off by 0.075 for NOR, 3D off by 0.15 for NOR\n\n3rd sector - F1-tempo off by 0.075 for NOR, 3D off by 0.15 for LEC"", 'Is F1 Tempo 100% accurate?', ""It just looks shit with how much it lags and slides. They have literally all the data they need, I don't know why they can't just overlay it better."", ""Hey there, I'm the creator of F1 Tempo and thought I would chime in. I can't speak for how F1 calculates relative position in their videos, but I can of course comment on how it's done in F1 Tempo. \n\nThe comment by u/f1bythenumbers pretty much nails it in terms of how the deltas calculations work. The core problem that causes inaccuracy is the low frequency data. As distance is calculated by integrating speed, the error in the distance accrues quickly and by the end of the lap there can be large discrepancies. Additionally, laps are taken with difference racing lines, so aligning the data to perform a direct and accurate comparison is difficult.\n\nIn F1 Tempo, I do a drift adjustment using the known total lap time delta to produce a cleaner result. This is crude, because it's only using a single correction to adjust the entire lap, so data within the lap is prone contain drift. \n\nI've been aware of this problem for some time, and have been hard at work on a brand new version of a site that does a better job of delta calculations. I now use the known sector times and distances to perform drift adjustments at the sector markings as well. This certainly doesn't solve the problem completely, but it does help. \n\nThe name of the new site is called GP Tempo, and you can check out the same telemetry [by clicking here](https://gp-tempo.com/app?year=2025&roundnumber=8&session=4&drivers=%5B%22NOR%22%2C%22LEC%22%5D&laps=%5B%7B%22y%22%3A2025%2C%22r%22%3A8%2C%22s%22%3A4%2C%22d%22%3A%22NOR%22%2C%22l%22%3A26%2C%22c%22%3A%22%23F47600%22%7D%2C%7B%22y%22%3A2025%2C%22r%22%3A8%2C%22s%22%3A4%2C%22d%22%3A%22LEC%22%2C%22l%22%3A26%2C%22c%22%3A%22%23ED1131%22%7D%5D&tab=telemetry).\n\nTL:DR, deltas are an approximation, GP Tempo has an improved approach, but the results should still be taken with grain of salt."", 'The data is the same, but gp-tempo.com has a much improved interface that you should use (made by the same guy)', 'I hope all you realize that Norris‚Äôs car is 3D here.\xa0\n\nAs a vfx artist, i can day it is not easy to make it better.', ""Unfortunately, neither F1 Tempo or any other site that uses the Fast-F1 api will be correct. The data isn't granular enough since you only get a data point every 0.2-0.3 seconds. Last time I checked, F1 Tempo was using the interpolation provided by default by the Fast-F1 api, which isn't accurate enough for millisecond precision.""]",220,52,0.92,220,516,516,2,0,0.0,2

9:42 to go in Q1, 0:13:25 in F1TV. I'll use F1TV's timestamps for practicality.

Our protagonists:

- **Stroll** is on a prep lap, going into the tunnel. He's about to let Tsunoda by.

- **Hamilton** (not Charles, sorry Lance) is behind him, also on a prep lap, he just let Tsunoda by.

- **Gasly** is on a fast lap.

13:28 - Hamilton: ""*Down on my delta cuz... traffic's crazy.*"" Engineer acknowledges and warns him of Gasly. **Hamilton speeds up**. 

13:37 - Stroll exits the tunnel. **Stroll's Engineer**: ""***Gasly coming now***, *watch for Gasly in the tunnel, Gasly 3, Gasly 2...*"". No warning is given about Hamilton.

13:38 - Hamilton exits the tunnel. At ""Gasly 2"", Hamilton overtakes Stroll, and Stroll moves back into the racing line.

13:40 - Gasly arrives at the scene and the debacle unfolds.

--- 

So IMO, this was a right old mess. Hamilton's worried about his delta, so he's passing cars on a slow lap. Stroll gets no warning about him. ""Gasly coming now"" is misleading. And all of this happens right when exiting the tunnel, when visibility is lowest, and on a braking zone.

If a driver is unable to complete a lap in the final session both drivers reached, the session is discarded (Haas Australia, McLaren Saudi, Miami Sprint Mercedes+Williams, Imola Red Bull are affected by this).

The exception to this is Mercedes Monaco - both drivers did not set a lap in Q2, so Q1 times were used (as they effectively ended qualifying at the same point).

Obviously datasets for Ver/Law and Gas/Col are very small, so are less reliable.

Interesting insights:

Norris wins on median but Piastri on mean. Piastri‚Äôs gaps when he‚Äôs won out are generally a lot bigger vs narrow ones when Norris has won out. McLaren is the smallest gap of all.

The ONLY time Monaco is exciting is when it rains.

Thus I would propose the following:

- Make Monaco a Sprint weekend

- Reduce the number of support races, as more prep time will be required between sessions. 

- Have Pirelli bring significantly more sets of inters to the track.

- Prior to every session including the race, and assuming it‚Äôs not raining, send a bunch of water trucks out to wet down the track, to make it suitable for inters but not to the point of needing full wets.  

- Do not wet the run-off areas, the chicane cutting areas, the inside of the tunnel, and the pit lane - for safety purposes. Perhaps avoid wetting the curbs on the racing line at Sainte Devote, Nouvelle Chicane, and the swimming pool. 

- If there are any red flags in the race, re-wet the track once it is safe, unless it is actually raining. This might be just wetting the standard racing line and not the full track width for time reasons.

- Make Beau Rivage a second DRS zone. This may not be applicable if the 2026 rules eliminate DRS.

The thing clearly has straight line speed and I think that's why Hamilton was able to snatch pole in China , long straights and not many slow corners it was the perfect track for that type of car unfortunately the rest of the calendar is nothing like Shanghai and that's probably why they've been so shit the last few months but thankfully they seem to have gotten their heads out of their arses.","['bro really went ahead and judged by monaco performance', ""A redditor thinking Ferrari's Monaco form this weekend is down to a rear wing is the most on brand thing they could have ever done."", ""Are we really doing this over Monaco performance?

It infuriates me to no end to see the same comments week after week. ""There's no overtakes, like at all""

Even if that week there were 40 overtakes.

I swear it's just the reality TV brainrot that has corrupted people's attention spans along with tiktok or whatever.

I'm not tuning in to F1 to see 159 overtakes, I'm tuning in to see this amazing engineering marvels dish it out - if someone overtakes - it's fucking amazing. But most of the time, it doesn't happen.
