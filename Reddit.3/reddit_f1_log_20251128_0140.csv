1p7we2e,McLaren explain cause of shock double Las Vegas disqualification,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p7we2e/mclaren_explain_cause_of_shock_double_las_vegas/,2025-11-27, News,,"['Stella - “we didn’t do it on porpoise”', 'Let’s just say that thanks to McLaren, it’s now really exciting to see what will happen in Qatar. You can’t blame them for that.', 'Andrea Stella:\n\n>The specific cause that led to the situation was the unexpected occurrence of extensive porpoising, inducing large vertical oscillations of the car. The level of porpoising was exacerbated by the conditions in which the car operated during the race, and it was not anticipated based on what we had seen in practice and based on the predictions of the car operating window in the race. Based on the data we had acquired in practice, we do not believe we took excessive risks in terms of ride height and we also added a safety margin for qualifying and the race, compared to practice, in terms of clearance to the ground. However, the safety margin was negated by the unexpected onset of the large vertical oscillations, which caused the car to touch the ground. The porpoising condition that the car developed in the race was also a difficult one to mitigate, as even a reduction in speed – an action that, in theory, should increase clearance to the ground – was only effective in some parts of the track but in others was actually counterproductive.', ""TLDR: It wasn't a risky setup choice, the car was porpoising excessively, and they don't expect to have similar trouble in Qatar or Abu Dhabi"", 'Tldr: they were disqualified for excessive plank wear.', ""I'm still struggling to understand why there's suddenly a porpoise issue. This car was almost perfect for most of the season, well-balance and no tire deg. Sure, they stopped upgrading, but that doesn't make the car worse.

1p7rya1,James Hinchcliffe and Alex Rossi explain McLaren DQs,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p7rya1/james_hinchcliffe_and_alex_rossi_explain_mclaren/,2025-11-27, Video,"James and Alex offer some insight into the DQs that I hadn’t seen/heard yet. 

I’m interested to hear what fans more knowledgeable than myself think about the discussion around how Austin, shortened practice stints, Max gaining on both Lando and Oscar, and a lack of data played into the risks McLaren took this weekend?","[""Lack of practice time definitely played apart, but it was the same for all the other teams. McLaren is definitely feeling the pressure, they took a risk running that low. Their car must be pretty sensitive to ride height changes for them to take that bet. Qatar will be interesting cause there's going to be limited practice time again. They could suffer in the sprint"", ""Alexander Rossi....now that's a name I haven't heard since the Silver Wars..."", 'We love you hinch and Alex... Two of the most genuine people on the internet, hands down. Two of the only people that share their real wealth of knowledge and insider information about motorsport, instead of just dumbing it down', 'I thought the plank is made from a resin/fiber glass material... not wood?', '“That thin?” needs to be on a t-shirt', 'I’ve watched other discussion videos over it and he’s basically made the same video over several others lol. If I was a commentary channel you wouldn’t catch me saying the same commentary as a majority of people even if it would be truthful lol. Just seems like lazy content.', 'On this podcast they explained that teams typically use the Sprint race as a long stint practice session to gauge plank wear so they know where to set the ride height for the race. At Austin both McLs didn’t even finish one Lap of the Sprint so they had virtually no data and set the height too high, affecting both drivers’ performance in the GP.', ""If [this article](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/what-could-be-behind-mclarens-plank-wear-dsq-shock/) is to be believed, it was less about running too low and more about running the floor differently than they had so far to deal with the unique demands of LV and last year's graining issues that caused unexpectedly high porpoising. \n\nStella has said earlier in the season that a strength of this year's car compared to last is that it's competitive over a bigger ride height range, so it's certainly not sensitive. Pressure, yes very likely."", 'Shoot this in my veins because I want a three-way shootout in Abudhabido.', ""Go watch IndyCar then, it's fun!""]",38,25,0.79,38,213,213,-2,0,-0.010000000000000009,-2
