1p5uq5n,How do you rate drivers?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p5uq5n/how_do_you_rate_drivers/,2025-11-24, Discussion,"How do you rate drivers?

In F1 spaces, there's a pretty strong consensus over where each driver relatively ranks. This post was prompted by [this discussion post asking who would be closest Max in the second RBR seat](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p5ftxx/which_driver_from_the_current_grid_would/), where there's a clear favorite answer (Charles) and then some runners-up (George, Fernando, and Lando a few times), which seems to be about the usual ranking.

But like...how do you guys know? I get that different drivers have demonstrated fantastic W2W skill or pace or raw speed, but these things are obviously affected by the car. When comparing drivers who have never been teammates, e.g. Russell vs. Leclerc, in your mind, how do you compensate for machinery? Like, I don't think I could say George *wouldn't* have done even better than Charles in the 2022 Ferrari, or that Charles wouldn't have more race wins than George in the 2025 Mercedes. 

I guess related: where does the consensus in the relative quality of cars come from? This season, with all the VCARB/RBR shenanigans, I've heard that the RBR has a higher ceiling but the VCARB is easier to drive. But based on what we know (everyone not Max has done better in the VCARB than the RBR), it seems equally possible that Verstappen is just car Jesus who  would have won the championship in the VCARB and the RBR without him would be a backmarker—not saying this is true or I believe it, but it doesn't necessarily seem *less* true than the current popular opinion.

I think the boring answer is that fans will naturally reach consensus (especially with new fans coming in and learning about past seasons via memes/stories) and that F1 is fundamentally not a sport where you can compare drivers like that, but I might be/probably am missing something. So how do you compare drivers and cars?","[""Vibes\n\nAnd consider how they're performing compared to their teammates, how consistent they are, and in relation to the team/car's recent performances.\n\nBut mostly vibes."", ""For that discussion post you linked, the reason Leclerc is mentioned is likely more because he and Verstappen like similarly slippery cars + have known each other for a long time so they're often associated together. \n\nIf we're rating based on skill, you'll never find a clear consensus on the 2nd best after Verstappen. There are people on here who 100% believe Leclerc, Russell, Norris, etc. are all bums - when in reality they just don't like them. Sports are inherently biased, that's part of the fun but also frustration when speaking to other fans."", ""The general public have no clue, including myself. There's so many factors that go into each driver's race.\n\nIt's mostly favoritism, vibes, or simple nationality that usually makes people like a driver more than others"", ""it's pure vibes, but most people vibe similarly, especially when they're not die-hard fans of any driver or team\n\nI'd say most people would agree max is, at the moment (and for the past few seasons), the strongest driver on the grid. \n\nOscar and lando were pretty close to eachother at the start of the year but oscar losing confidence as of late and lando REALLY hitting his stride in the last few races"", ""This is Reddit, we rate drivers based on whether we like them or not.

It does also capture that there can be bias.', ""It's tough, you cant REALLY, definitively and quantitatively really compare drivers. Even in NFL with all their stats, sometimes the numbers dont tell the whole story; maybe someone isnt putting up big numbers in TD's pr recieving yards, but they're still playing a big part in their teams performance. If you cant really quantify exactly two NFL players, with all their billions of stats, we've no chance to really quantify F1 drivers in different machinery, lol.\n\nBut everyone does it anyway, you just see how someone performs race after race, over a whole season. For a better read though you need a couple seasons. Like Albon I felt was higher up in earlier years, but this seson, even though he's had some great performances, hes made a bunch of silly mistakes and crashed unnecessarily, kinda brings him down a tiny bit.\n I'd say you rate them based on a number of diff variables, hows their qualy, how do they develop over a weekend, how do they compare to their teammate, what do the drivers and team say about the car (easy or difficult to drive, really sharp balance that snaps on you, then you give them more leeway, or like verstappen, if they dominate in that cars is all the more impressive), how they do in qualy, how they deal with pressure, how they bounceback from shitty weekends, etc""]",0,43,0.48,0,248,248,0,1,0.0,0

1p653ta,My take on Lando's championship fight so far!,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p653ta/my_take_on_landos_championship_fight_so_far/,2025-11-25, Discussion,"Suppose there's a guy in your class -born intelligent, always on the top, perfect scores and then there's you, an ordinary guy with ordinary skills. One day you started working really hard for a test and scored more than the other guy. 

Was that luck? Maybe. Was that hardwork? Definitely. Was that worthy? Hell yeah.

Max is a born driver with top skills. There are million times where I thought ""how is he doing that?"". But lando is a hard worker. He got abilities, skills and most importantly resilience. I thought championship was over for him after zandvoort. But he fought back. Was there luck involved? Yeah. But dude got some balls. He always says 'one race at a time ' many people will not like that approach. But for me, that is patience. 

How can anyone say ""he is not worthy of the championship""? He for sure worked hard for that. Just because there's another guy in the grid who is more skilled than him doesn't make him unworthy. Instead, you should appreciate that he outscored the top of the class. Hardwork should always be rewarded. 

And some of you will say, ""it's the car!!"" If that is the truth, great. This is a MOTORSPORT, not a driversport. We are watching this to see some of the best machineries in the world. It's not an individual sport, there are hundreds of people involved in a single car. If lando is not the reason for his success in a McLaren, then ask other cars to make a fucking rocketship as well. It's not his problem that he got a good car and others didn't. He is maximizing his output and he shouldn't be blamed for that. 

I'm not any driver's fan. I just love racing, strategies and the engines. It's what I watch this sport for. But I'm tired of seeing people saying he is not a championship material bullshit. Everyone in that grid is championship material, that's why they were entrusted with a fucking car in the first place. No one is wishing their driver to be P20 when they give their car. It's the machineries and the state of mind of the driver that makes the difference.

For me, lando is top 2 driver in the current grid after max. Only thing I hate about Lando's racing is that sometimes he takes lot of time to overtake. But he was never like that in his rookie years. Over the years, he became a lot cautious and that's the difference between him and max. Max takes risks and he just got this incredible vision. But for Lando, most of the time he is cautious, and if he takes a risk for once it will end up like Canada because of his lack of judgement. Recent times, like in Singapore he showed his aggression for once and tbh I loved it. I hope he does more like that in the future. And no one is a perfect driver, everyone makes mistakes and that is okay. Even Max has good days and bad days. At the end of the day, we are here for racing.

He raced, he won, he got points and at the end if all those points are more than any others in the grid then he is the champion of THAT SEASON. There is no ""undeserve"" in that. And people who make these claims are 'driver's fan' not a 'formula1 fan","['His resilience is my favorite part of his game. \n\nWithout a strong mental game his season would have ended sitting on a dune at Zandvoort.', ""If he has the most points at the end of the season, he's the deserved winner."", 'I agree with OP in general, except that I think Leclerc & Russell are slightly better drivers.

But for some reason it\'s only certain drivers.\n\nAt the end of the day, if we started claiming drivers didn\'t deserve a championship due to events that happened in the season both inside and outside of their control, no one would deserve it, cause that\'s just how the sport is, there\'s no way to win undeservingly, unless cheating of course, which no one has actually done despite conspiracy theories.\n\nIf you win, you win, they put in the work, sometimes things didn\'t go their way, sometimes they did, it\'sqll part of the game.

Also, from your example, you have to be fair and acknowledge that Max has also been working extremely hard all through his career. He didn't just end up with an insane amount of talent, that talent is developed through all the racing and practicing he's done (and still does) to an insane degree. \n\nBut sure, Lando deserves the championship if he finished ahead on the points, it will very likely only be a one off unless they nail the regulations and/or red bull completely mess up the development of the new car."", ""Even with him getting a lot of credit lately for how he overcame the setback of Zandvoort, I still think a lot of people miss how when Lando is knocked down he often locks in and bounces back even stronger: \n\n- After Qatar '24 where a mistake of his caused a major stop/go penalty that cost Mclaren their chance of sealing the constructor's that day, he locked in and went from (iirc) last in the field to P10 + fastest lap in the very few laps remaining to salvage at least 2 points for the team, and then absolutely dominated the next weekend in Abu Dhabi to bring the Constructor's home for his team\n- After Canada, he responded to his mistake there by leading every single session in Austria and winning 3 of the next 4 races.\n- After his Zandvoort DNF, he's responded by beating Oscar 8-0 in races (incl sprint) and 9-1 in qualifying, and turning a 34 point deficit into a 24 point lead in 6 races.\n\nAnd those are just a few examples from the last year. Lando's not a perfect driver by any means but I think the way he responds to adversity and frustration (whether it be self-inflicted or out of his control) shows a ton of composure and strength. A lot of people seem to think this DSQ is somehow going to make him crumble, when in reality he’s shown that it’s very likely to do the opposite.""]",0,21,0.28,0,20,20,0,4,-0.019999999999999962,0
