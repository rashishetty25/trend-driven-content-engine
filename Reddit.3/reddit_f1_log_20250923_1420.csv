1no0vla,I think the 10 second penalty for Albon shows a deeper problem of the current stewarding,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1no0vla/i_think_the_10_second_penalty_for_albon_shows_a/,2025-09-22, Discussion,"I think this incident highlights the problems of the recent limit on penalties. Only handing out 5 or 10-second penalties for the vast majority of incidents means that incidents like this, which cost Colapinto 25+ seconds, kind of make it worth it (obviously not really, as it also costs Albon and penalty points). Introducing 15-second penalties, and actually using drive-throughs and stop-and-go's. 

The current stewarding process needs fixing in general. I think a selection of professional stewards is needed, but even stuff like this shows they need to go back over a lot of the guidance and really have another look.

They have pretty much sorted the extending track limits, which was a massive talking point a few years ago, by just using the B&W black, which is what it was there for, but wasn't used for ages. It shows that a lot of these stewarding problems do come from the guidance issued to them.","[""Penalties are not meant to repair the damage done, just to disuade drivers from doing certain things. I don't think it was worth it for Albon, even if it was way worse for Colapinto."", 'Bad take. Penalties aren’t there to vindicate the driver that got crashed into, but to punish the driver that caused the crash. Sucks to be the guy that got crashed into, but giving Albon a 25 second penalty because he cost Colabinto 25 seconds doesn’t do shit.', ""Stewarding has many more serious problems, I don't think this is a major problem.   \nConsistency and timeliness mostly.\n  \n\nIf you are found to gamble on penalties being worth it penalties do increase and have in the past (ie don't be dumb on radio). Penalties are also already handed out based on result often, so smaller penalties suffice.   \n  \nThe current drivers are also keeping it rather clean, so there is no need to penalize missteps as harshly"", 'Penalties should penalise the action and not the outcome. Which has been heavily discussed before with the Ham/Ver incident in Silverstone. \n\nPeople said a race ban would be appropriate, because Verstappen crashed with 50G and Hamilton was able to continue and score points.', 'I agree with you - Fornaroli on Dunne in the F2 race is another example.\n\nOn Russell at Monaco - it’s not good race direction IMO if the guidance allows drivers to profit from purposefully taking a penalty, which is entirely why the standard one moved up to ten seconds from five in the first place.', ""Yeah, I totally understand that penalties are not meant to repair the damage done, but looking back it was a very good trade for Albon, I don't think he was penalized at all tbh."", ""been saying it for a while. Driving standards have tanked a few years after the 5/10 second penalties. They were introduced to have less severe options for minor shit but they very very quickly became a replacement for almost all penalties. So many insane things done on track and rarely a drive through, stop go or black flag. Max shoulda got the black flag in mexico for sure. IN brazil again max should have gotten a drive through probably for how egregious that shove off was, but instead no penalty at all but that's because over hte years worse and worse behaviour went from a drive through, to a 10 second penalty, to a 5 second penalty to often being ignored.\n\nF2 is a heavy result of this. Kids coming through having never really watched/remembered f1 before the 5 second penalties were introduced. dive bombing being rewarded, cutting corners being rewarded is just the f1 they would have gone from like 5-15 yrs old watching and now those kids are in f3/f2 driving like maniacs."", ""Penalties aren't meant to copy the impact you had on the other driver. They are there to make it unattractive to do naughty stuff. \n\nThings would get very weird when you make a penalty the same as the impact on the other driver. It could even incentivize the other driver to crash his car in the wall because that can make sure that your rival will score 0 points we well. \n\nAnd what if a driver gets wounded or even dies in an incident. It would be a tragedy to lose 2 drivers ;)\n\nAlso it was very much not worth it for Albon here to begin with with a 10s penalty."", ""I know they are not meant to repair damage; it's more about how I can see this alongside other incidents labelled as 10-second penalties, which are not on the same level.\n\nIf you hand out 5-second penalties for minor incidents and 10-second penalties for everything besides that, then worse incidents are dealt with the same.\n\nIf drivers know that no matter what moves they do, the worst they will get is a 10-second penalty, things like Russell's chicane cutting at Monaco will become more and more common (I know he got a drive-through). \n\nMax got a 10-second penalty for the incident in Spain, which was a more serious incident than this by Albon, but I would also say this was a more major incident than quite a lot of the 10-second penalties handed out.\n\nAll of them exist on a scale, and not using the entire scale of penalties to reflect the seriousness of incidents seems like something that will come to cause a major problem eventually."", ""if he got a 25 second penalty he's not likely to do it again, and other drivers are unlikely to try to stick their nose in that late again. The fact that drivers so frequently get such small penalties encourages them to try these reckless moves dramatically more often.\n\nBut also there is this issue of fans looking at every dive bomb collectively and deciding they are all non risky. Albon had zero room there, zero chance, he was way too far back and this is not a track that has room for error, this was not a shallow corner with more than enough space for him to bomb in at that speed that late.\n\nthis was a literally never going to work move, not an well he messed up but the move was there for the taking, this move was never even close to on and he tried it anyway... because the penalty for trying is so low.""]",0,23,0.34,0,216,216,0,1,0.010000000000000009,0
