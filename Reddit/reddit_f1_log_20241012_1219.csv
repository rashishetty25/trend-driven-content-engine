1g17keq,Brief Summary of an Evening with Guenther Steiner ,"Went to this last night in Liverpool. It's great to see if you get the chance.

He discusses his role at Ford, working in Banbury/Oxford developing the Focus Rally Car, the challenges of managing Colin McRea and Carlos Sainz senior, his introduction to F1 through Niki Lauda, with some cracking anecdotes, which led to the start of his F1 career, the setting up of Haas and the challenges of obtaining the F1 license, although it's seemingly nothing compared to today, the accomplishments of HAAS and how their initial success rattled some other teams and TPs, the drama with Russian investment and subsequent war, his relationship with Gene and why he was mentally ready to exit when he did. He talks about Netflix and why he hasn't ever watched DTS. He had a brief cameo in the new F1 film with Brad Pitt, so keep an eye out for that. 

He was as entertaining as you expect. There's loads more tour dates coming in as he's pushing another book. His ghost writer/publisher is the host and has followed him around for a number of years. All good fun.

1g0psb7,Driver and Team Radio Broadcast - A Good Thing?,"Hi all,

I just wanted to know what opinions here are with regards to the amount of team/driver radio that is broadcast. Do you think that it adds to the sport's broadcast, or do you think it takes away some of the sport's magic and mystique? 

Personally I preferred not hearing from the drivers during a race. Commentators and viewers were left to think more about the reasons for fluctuations in pace, speculate over any challenges the driver or team were encountering.  It was up to the viewer to try to make sense of the race as it unfolded. 

But I am an old folgie, probably plagued by Rose-Tinted spectacles for the 90s!

1fzlnnt,Il Predestinato has got to be the hardest-hitting driver nickname ever in F1,"Because of the long break, I found myself watching extended highlights of memorable moments this season. I came back to Charles Leclerc's victory in Monza and I heard again Carlo Vanzini, the Italian commentator, calling Leclerc ""Il Predestinato"" (The Predestined). When Vanzini started calling Charles ""Il Predestinato"" back in Bahrain 2019, it already hit hard, especially in his first win in Monza, Il Predistinato Vince! (The Chosen One!). But this time in Monza 2024 with a win coming unexpectedly, it hit even harder. 

Il Predestinato is crazy as it is not just a badass sounding nickname but it captures Charles carrying the hopes and expectations of a nation. What a burden, if you think about it, but Charles winning two Italian GPs already make him worthy of the nickname, IMO. Kimi may be the last Ferrari WDC but The Predestined winning two races on home turf may have already made Charles a more beloved Ferrari driver.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fzlnnt/il_predestinato_has_got_to_be_the_hardesthitting/,2024-10-09 07:10:21,"3 days, 5:08:45.045938",1513,136,2024-10-12 12:19:06

1fz4e59,"Can racing in Monaco be fixed simply by an ""reverse joker lap"" logic?","As we all know, overtaking in Monaco is impossible no matter how much faster you are (unless you are 6s faster which is impossible to achieve in dry condition).

Some may suggest increasing the number of mandatory pit stop to provide more strategy variation which kind of making sense, but still, this doesn't change the fact that overtaking on track is impossible. No teams will give up track position to any one no matter how many stops they need to do. Moreover, 1 more stop means less tyre delta, it will be even harder to perform undercut / overcut.

  
Instead I come up with a simple solution: 

Each drivers have **5 free chances to cut Turn 1, only if they got DRS on the pit straight** and **no pit** **warning light is currently flashing** (to avoid collision with cars exiting the pit), however they **cannot run over pit exit line** (to avoid collision with the car driving in the racing line).

Why Turn 1? Turn 1 is the only corner that can be safely cut because the car behind will not run into the car in front.

Why DRS? DRS is an indicator that the track is dry (safe for doing this) and the car behind is within 1s (cannot be used for defending, unless they are in a DRS train). Similar concept can be applied after 2026.

[Drivers can't cut Turn 1 without getting DRS, this image is only to show the line for cutting Turn 1](https://preview.redd.it/hy4lf270xjtd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9c1d4ecfe170d49cdf09ce606bc5ff488b77ff8)

[Drivers cannot cross over pit exit line while cutting](https://preview.redd.it/0qzt4uyhzjtd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bfe2b0d243a4d2f09cb9876949b33319b29e8dc)

Time gained by cutting Turn 1 is around 1s (purely my estimation, may not be the actual case but they can easily control this delta by amending the shape of Turn 1), which means they may be quite close to each other all the way up to Turn 3, yes this may be dangerous (as we can see from the Perez - K Mag incident) but at least this will provide more wheel-to-wheel racing which is unthinkable in modern Monaco GP, and they are the best drivers in the world, they can sort themselves out.

(Of course this won't count as a valid lap time)



This solution can make all drivers push all race (no matter they are attacking / defending for position). Pushing means more mistakes and more tyre degradation, which makes either undercut / overcut become much more powerful and significant (drivers with an overcut strategy can now overtake cars on track in this way).

1fy6lka,The mathematically best drivers to never win a championship,"Recently, there have been a post or two trying to figure out who the best drivers to never win a championship were. I find that question very interesting and put together a list, based on my [mathematical model](https://f1mathematicalmodel.com). To make this more representable, I went decade by decade. I assigned the drivers to the decade in which they had most of their best seasons according to the model. For each decade I then picked out the 2 worst drivers that are WDC, and the 3 best that aren't, aswell as their best seasons. Behind the driver name, you'll find the model's overall rating (based on the 4 best seasons), and behind that in parentheses the driver's theoretical ceiling.

# 1960s

The model doesn't assess most of the 60s yet, but Moss and Gurney seem to clearly be the 2 strongest non-champions, while Hulme and Phil Hill are clear candidates for weakest champions.



# Final Thoughts

Unfortunately, most of the higher rated non-champions are tales of accidents instead of squandered potential or ""never had the car"". However, filtering those out, you'll notice a mixed zone in the high 70s. Most champions seem to at least have a potential of 80. Of those that weren't denied by career or life ending accidents, Daniel Ricciardo, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, and Gerhard Berger are the most unlucky to not take a title, according to the model. Of these three, Berger has the single highest rated season in 1994, and Frentzen the single highest ranked season in 1999 - quite fittingly, he had an outside shot at the championship¬†that¬†year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fy6lka/the_mathematically_best_drivers_to_never_win_a/,2024-10-07 12:38:58,"4 days, 23:40:09.612477",911,215,2024-10-12 12:19:07

&#x200B;

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

GOOD LUCK AND MAY THE TRASH TALK BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOUR.

1fwe1gv,Do F1 teams care less about driving performance when they get millions of dollars of backing?,"If teams perform badly, they get little air time, which means advertisers get less air time. That means less money in advertising for those F1 teams.

In order to get on the podium and more air time, they need a good driver yeah? Someone like a Max, Alonso etc. That makes sense.

*But does that sort of get thrown out the window when you have a lot of team funding from the driver's parents or backing? (correct me if I'm wrong).*

* Lance stroll is terrible. Gets outqualified by Alonso many times. Stroll does nothing with the car while Alonso puts it in podiums and at least gets points.
* Yuki Tsunoda is okay at best and not amazing (even after many years). Thing is Honda has a relationship with Red Bull or something. Makes many errors.
* Zhou has a 30 million dollar backing from Chinese companies. Zhou has been outqualified by Bottas. Valtteri Bottas 17-1 Zhou Guanyu .. in qualifying.
* Ricciardo was a highly marketable driver and for a few years, the ""face"" of F1. His driving adaptability isn't the best. In qualifying... Daniel Ricciardo 6-12 Yuki Tsunoda
* Perez has progressively gotten worse in F1 compared to Max, but he brings in a lot of Merch sales and has some good sponsors.  He's also very popular. Max destroys perez. In qualifying .. Max Verstappen 17-1 Sergio Perez.

- is it permitted to enter with a DSLR camera, zoom lens, to the grandstands? Canon EOS SL2 with 18-200 lens to be exact. What about GoPro or selfie sticks?
- any recommendations about affordable places to stay? We are 2 or 3 guys, 35 to 40 yrs old, going, and I've been to Sao Paulo before, but just for 3 days. I am aware the city is dangerous but my country has its dangerous places as well so I know the basics of how to survive hehehe.

1fvoyik,Dynamic Ticket Pricing - Melbourne F1,"My friends and I are heading to Melbourne for the F1. We have booked our accommodation in advance, as this disappears fast, and we‚Äôre awaiting the pre-sale for tickets. We normally take a grandstand seat on the last corner leading to the start/finish straight.  
  
We receive the invite for booking tickets and are met with the pricing ‚Äòfrom $625‚Äô. This seems a little higher than years gone by, but whatever - it‚Äôs only a little bit more so no big deal.  
  
Clicking the link takes you to Ticketmaster where they have applied ‚Äòdynamic pricing‚Äô. You now pay a market price based on demand, so the tickets I could otherwise purchase for $625 are close to $1,000.  
  
Formula One reportedly generates +$2b USD each year, and are apparently committed to growing the sport? This is an absolute joke.  
  
Just a small rant really, but having seen the reports of the shit-show in Vegas last year, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm surprised, just really disappointed that this is where sport is heading now days.

1fvh051,Best Driver not to win a championship (top 3 for each decade by wins and podiums),"Another post inspired me to make one I've been meaning to for a while. Stirling Moss is widely regarded as the best driver never to win a championship, but it's impossible to compare eras in F1. So here's a few contenders, divided up by decades, and their wins and podiums.

Where a driver spans multiple decades, I've just repeated their information for each decade.

I've left out drivers who are still active.

If some of these names are surprising, remember, every driver with better stats than them has won a WDC.

50s:

Stirling Moss, raced 1955-1961, 16 wins (24% of total Grands Prix entered), 24 podiums (36% of total Grands Prix entered)

1fvdqsh,Anything stopping a team fielding 3 drivers (not cars)? ,"There's a common theory that some high performing drivers are able to drive at their best whatever the circuit, whilst others excel on some, struggle on another. These end up being a clear number one in a team, with potential to win a WDC, and the other good enough to just bring in the points for the WCC.


Im sure it's easy enough to look up, but asking here for debate. Could a team, in theory, employ the generational talent and two additional drivers with different strengths. They run the number one all season, and swap out the other two in the second car based on which is best for the circuit.

1fvc4dw,I made a thing: Interactive F1 GOAT comparison tool (feedback welcome!),"Hey r/formula1, Long-time lurker, occasional commenter here. I've been working on a little side project, and I thought some of you might find it interesting. It's an interactive tool that lets you compare F1 drivers across different eras based on various stats. Here's what it does:

* Compares drivers using stats like wins/GP, championships/season, podiums, etc. 
* Lets you adjust the importance of each stat 
* Shows results in real-time as you tweak the settings 
* Works for different eras of F1

I know the Greatest Of All Time debate is always contentious (and probably impossible to settle), but I thought it might be fun to have a data-driven way to play around with the numbers.  
You can check it out here: [https://www.formula1points.com/performance/greatest-of-all-time](https://www.formula1points.com/performance/greatest-of-all-time)

I'm not trying to push any particular driver as the GOAT ‚Äì the whole point is that you can adjust it based on what you think is important. And of course, stats don't tell the whole story of a driver's career.

Anyway, I'd love to hear what you think. Any feedback, suggestions, or ideas for improvement would be really appreciated.

A while ago I asked you guys for tips on Formula 1 podcasts, and you delivered! 
My favourite is still definitely The Race, where every episode is fkawless. But the other ones I'd encourage a look at are:



F1 Nation - It's good and interesting. Tom Clarkson 



Beyond the grid - good for in depth interviews 
Tom Clarkson




The Inside line - F1 journalists and writers, they have fun together, but not in a broey way 



F1 chequered flag - BBC. Quick with new episodes after each race. I think it's uneven




Formula for success - Uneven. David Coulthard is always great, but Eddie Jordan is sometimes fun but sometimes just babbling.
A mix between news and old times 




And then The Race tech show if you're in to that. Which I am! With Edd Straw and former F1 technical director Gary Anderson 





My question is, is it worth paying for The Race Patreon membership? It's not really clear to me how much extra you get for the money. I'm not that interested in asking questions myself which seems to be a big selling point, but I'd love more content. I'm also not really interested in hearing too much about the good old days, I prefer to learn more about what's going on now.

Well a team which doesn't finish in Top 3 in WCC.

Looking at the current drivers who drove in midnfield teams:

Max - drove for Toro Rosso

Alonso - Alpine, Aston Martin

Norros (WDC designate) - drove for McLaren when they were midfield


Looking at prior drivers:

Vettel - drove for Toro Rosso, Aston Martin

Michael - drove for Benetton, Mercedes


Now Lewis is towards the end of the career and unless he makes a comeback after retiring from Ferrari, I don't see him driving for mid-field team, which will make him the only WDC who never drove for a mid field team.

1ftxrle,Frustrated by Lando press coverage ,"Is anyone else as frustrated by the press coverage of Lando Norris this year? At least the English (usually UK based) coverage? Yes, there is an outside chance he could win the WCC, but that‚Äôs always been a super small chance, given that Max remains one of the best drivers in recent years and he‚Äôs still in a very very good car. 

Add to this that McLaren just isn‚Äôt as cohesive a team as Mercedes and, until recently, Red Bull. 

Look, I‚Äôm unapologetically a Landostan, and watching Oscar has been one of the joys of F1. The racers are already hard enough on themselves (thinking of Lando at last year‚Äôs Silverstone vs this years) and this press fixation that if Lando doesn‚Äôt somehow pull a 2021 ultimate victorious lap in Abu Dhabi means he will have failed this season is so ludicrous to me. 

 A lot of people blame recent fans for wanting the 2021 season again, but honestly, most of us are really really enjoying this season mightily, not because of one specific driver vs another, but because it feels as though things are in motion for so many of the teams and this means not only a great year this year, but likely next year too.

It‚Äôs a big hill to climb but given that Max is having issues with the car and that Norris is not maximizing at every race, can history repeat itself in the WDC?

Ferrari being the dark horse for the WDC seems more likely. Max and Norris are struggling, Perez has been off all season, Oscar might lose some mojo having to play second fiddle.

If Ferrari decide to maximize both cars without caring about the WDC, can they manage to win the WCC?

1ftwk5p,Theory on Alpine,"tl:dr is they're gonna sell, but try to remain in F1 under the Alpine name so they spend the least amount of money. 

There's been way too many rumors about Alpine selling for there not to be any smoke to this fire no matter what they say publicly. The entire mismanagement since abiteboul left has been on another level even for Alpine. It looks way too familiar to MBA practices of gutting the company to reduce costs then putting a bow on it to make it attractive for the highest bidder. If they find a privateer that will take over operations at Enstone, they can reduce costs further if the privateer must use the Alpine name.

Viry will continue developing engines for WEC, what they have now can replace that shit Mechachrome in the A424. The 26 F1 engine might be shit in F1 but it's much better than the Mechachrome. WEC gives them more freedom in developing their own engine and costs a fraction to run a car than F1. They've already spent money developing the 26 engine so tossing that into the A424 means R&D not going to waste and people's jobs are saved. Renault doesn't have to payout a bunch of money to employees or gov fines. They can focus more on pushing reliability and less on pushing performance in WEC. 

Enstone facilities can be sold to a privateer where they cover the operating costs but the rights to the facilities stays with Renault should the privateer team wish to sell or pull out. Alpine can sell the rights to Enstone operations with the stipulation that the privateer must use the Alpine name. They will likely get paid for the name same as if Alpine was a title sponsor. Realistically it's little more than a major discount towards the operating costs of Enstone. 

Signatech already runs the Alpine WEC team, Mechachrome designs their engine, Alpine designs the car's Aero, Oreca develops the chassis. This same situation is what I feel they're trying to replicate in F1. 

For example if Hi-Tech bought the rights to team operations then it'd be. Hi-Tech runs the team, Enstone develops the aero & chassis, Merc designs the engine, Alpine sponsors the car. 

So whoever buys the team is really only paying the yearly cost cap which is a much cheaper option then the $1B price tag to fully buy out the team.

# Stats & Standings

**With no race to report on this week, let‚Äôs tuck into a bevvy of stats and standings; the meaningful, the whimsical, and the amusing:**

Such as [Lance Stroll laying claim to the most races raced without a fastest lap.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fnl3hx/most_races_without_fastest_lap/)

For a stat that‚Äôll take some wind outta Lando‚Äôs sails‚Ä¶ After Singapore, [Max has the same 52 point lead over Lando in the WDC that he had 13 races ago going into the Miami Grand Prix.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fni3qa/daniel_valente_most_points_scored_since_miami_max/) Despite all of Red Bull‚Äôs woes‚Ä¶ Incredible.

Continuing with Maxy stats, [he‚Äôs leading the championship (obviously) and has led more than double the laps of anyone](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fpc057/f1_leading_the_championship_and_leading_more_than/) else this season.

Behold, [our podium finishers after 18 rounds!](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fociw3/podium_finishers_after_18_races/)¬†

Here be [the WDC Top 10 after 18 rounds, 2023 vs. 2024‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fofwtj/23_24_points_rd18/)

And [the latest update in 2024‚Äôs Black vs. Yellow T-Cam Championship](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fralhq/black_vs_yellow_tcam_2024_championship_standings/).

For some neat insight into each team‚Äôs head-to-head driver battles, [this post breaks down the percentage of each team‚Äôs points scored per driver.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fs2j9f/f1guydan_percentage_of_teams_points_scored_by/)

\~\~\~

# The Drivers‚Äô Mumblings & Mutterings

Well folks, there we have it: In a poorly handled and unceremonious end to [the Honey Badger](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fq1yot/davidcoulthardf1_danielricciardo_has_become_one/)‚Äôs Formula 1 career, [Danny Ric has been released from RB with immediate effect](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fpzdzm/f1_breaking_daniel_ricciardo_to_leave_rb_the_team/). I have no special love for Danny Ric and was never of the mind that he‚Äôd bounce back from his McLaren travails, but how Red Bull managed this situation over the past week was [awfully disrespectful, and disappointing](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fqazfg/further_puts_in_perspective_how_profoundly/). For a man loved in the paddock by so many, he deserved to go out with a celebration, not while shrouded in whispers and rumours.

However, [what Red Bull lacked in decorum](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/when-lawson-knew-he-was-getting-rb-seat-and-how-ricciardo-handled-it/) while handling Danny Ric‚Äôs exit, I like to think has been made up for by the groundswell of heartfelt goodbyes and support from [drivers](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fqktpx/yukitsunoda0511_it_was_a_big_pleasure_to_be_your/), [the rest of the paddock](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fqkn8m/formula_1_one_of_formula_1s_most_beloved/), even [Netflix](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fqedn8/netflix_daniel_ricciardo_forever_our_honey_badger/) and [GQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fql088/gqaustralia_farewell_instagram_post_for_daniel/).

In Formula 1, race seats are never empty for long. Daniel‚Äôs mid-season departure paves the way for [Liam Lawson to finally get his opportunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fq0sah/liam_lawson_via_instagram_ive_dreamed_of_being_a/) with Toro-Tauri-VCARB. While there‚Äôs no confirmation from Red Bull on this matter, the suspected consensus is that the purpose of putting him in the seat *now* is [to evaluate him as a potential driver for the top team in 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fq1z41/lawsons_ricciardo_sub_is_surely_a_2025_red_bull/). No pressure, kid.

*(Making for a classic ‚ÄúWelcome to Formula 1‚Äù moment,* [Liam will be slapped with a 10 place grid penalty in Austin](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fqjjlc/liam_lawson_to_serve_10place_grid_penalty_in/) *thanks to needing to add an additional engine into his‚Äîthe car‚Äôs‚Äîpool. Say hi to Valtteri for me!)*

Naturally, rumblings of unofficial origin are already suggesting that [F1‚Äôs newest Kiwi, Liam Lawson, could lose his freshly minted seat in 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fsaadr/liam_lawson_he_could_lose_his_cockpit_to_hadjar/) to the young driver [Red Bull has seemingly bet all of their future chips on, Isack Hadjar](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1frouoh/feeder_series_news_isack_hadjar_is_the_new_red/) (who is currently a handful of points off P1 in his rookie F2 season).

In contrast to the murky muckiness going on at Red Bull and Co, perhaps we have some clarity on Sauberaudi‚Äôs driver plans: [Which may be to sign Bottas for the ride alongside Hulky McHulkerson, and bring Bortoleto on board as a reserve.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fnn88b/sauber_set_to_make_2025_double_driver/) That plan doesn‚Äôt tickle my pickle as I‚Äôd love to see Bortoleto be our probable 5th rookie next year, but alas, I‚Äôm just a man with a Reddit account.

While perhaps premature and dramatic, courtesy of The Race, [Albono is facing his career-defining test](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fo9g79/albons_facing_his_careerdefining_test_six_months/) six months early thanks to the shockingly good surprise rookie, Franco Colapinto. In any case, Franco‚Äôs ferocity followed by Carlos in the car next year *will* be rather revealing of Alex‚Äôs performance level.

Speaking of Franco, [Darth Helmut Marko has an eye on him‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fr2q4o/marko_colapinto_is_definitely_someone_for_the/)

\~\~\~

# The Teams‚Äô Twistings & Turnings

Amongst the Singaporian madness, Sith Lord Christian Horner casually expressed interest in George Russell for 2026 given he‚Äôs out of contract at the end of next season. Master Wolff responded with a classic [‚ÄúChristian is always trying to stir shit up‚Ä¶‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fngxdk/autosport_toto_says_christian_is_always_trying_to/) That‚Äôll be one full and glorious weekend of community service for you, Toto Stinkmouth!

In case you‚Äôre wondering how likely Red Bull poaching George is, Toto went on to say that [‚ÄúGeorge has been a Mercedes driver forever and hopefully will be forever.‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fp9xlc/f1_george_russells_not_going_anywhere_on_totos/) Reading between the lines, I‚Äôm interpreting that as ‚Äúgood luck and piss off Christian!‚Äù However, stranger things happened in F1‚Ä¶

Speaking of the FIA‚Äôs new swear jar, [the drivers are reportedly set to hold private talks over \[their?\] response to Max‚Äôs sweary ‚Äúcontroversy‚Äù.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fneu1l/f1_drivers_set_for_private_talks_over_response_to/) Max‚Äôs dad, Jos politely scathed the FIA in an interview, calling their crusade against no-no words [‚Äúthe most ridiculous thing ever.‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fsd46k/exclusive_jos_verstappen_calls_fia_swearing_row/)

If you‚Äôre into keeping tabs on such things, [here‚Äôs a comprehensive list of all the young drivers to have taken part in an FP1 session this year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fnk3kp/autosport_f1_young_drivers_to_have_driven_in_fp1/)

Not with anything close to immediate effect, [Red Bull will be losing Will Courtenay, their chief strategist, to McLaren](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fod4md/erik_van_haren_news_another_important_pawn_is/) where he‚Äôll become their Sporting Director as of mid-2026. And so the Brain Drain continues‚Ä¶

Sith Lord Horner claims that [Red Bull are rebuilding after their torrid Monza low.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1foaz8a/horner_red_bull_rebuilding_after_monza_low_point/) Which leaves this cynical fan wondering if that explains Max being back at the sharp end while Checo was mired in the Singaporian midfield‚Ä¶

\~\~\~

# Technical Tidbits

Ferrari have claimed to have finally gotten on top of their intermittent-but-recurring bouncing issues after [identifying an anomaly in their wind tunnel](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fpr26j/ferrari_on_top_of_bouncing_issues_after/). Tricksy wind tunnels can‚Äôt be trusted‚Ä¶ WDC & WWC 2025?

\~\~\~

# This Week in Formula 1 History

35 years ago, [Nigel Mansell was disqualified from the Portuguese Grand Prix](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fo70m0/on_this_day_35_years_ago_nigel_mansell_was/) after missing his Ferrari pit box and reversing in the pit lane. Oopsy-daisy!

19 years ago, Fernando Alonso clinched his first drivers title. [Ollie Bearman was 6 months old, while Kimi Antonelli literally didn‚Äôt even exist.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fp7rr9/daniel_valente_19_years_ago_today_fernando_alonso/) Crrrazy.

3 years ago, Lewis Hamilton [won the Russian Grand Prix for the 5th time](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fprqrs/on_this_day_3_years_ago_lewis_hamilton_won_the/)‚Äî[scoring his 100th Formula 1 victory in the process](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fpux2i/mercedes_amg_f1_via_instagram_an_iconic_moment/).

# For Funsies

Please enjoy [George Russell pretending to be a tree.](https://www.instagram.com/p/DAQWzeYoaeB/)

After putting in the hard yards to bring us from-the-streets pictures of the build up to the Singapore Grand Prix, [](https://www.reddit.com/user/MilkTeaRamen/) has done much the same in bringing us [snapshots of the track and paddock deconstruction.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fo8zqa/two_days_after_the_singapore_grand_prix/)

If you‚Äôd care for more insight into the story of one of our looming new rookies for 2025 and hopefully beyond, [Young Ollie Bearman appeared on F1‚Äôs ‚ÄòBeyond The Grid‚Äô Podcast.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fp5a1e/f1_beyond_the_grid_ollie_bearman_just_getting/) And speaking of [young F1 drivers‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fp3kv7/f1_when_we_were_young/)

In what I sincerely hope is a subtle ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to the FIA and their new swear jar rules, [Max Verstappen plans to narrate a sweary, adults-only adaptation of The Very Hungry Caterpillar](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fpkupy/verstappen_to_narrate_sweary_adultsonly/). I shudder to think of how many days of community service the FIA will try and slap him with after this goes live‚Ä¶

Speaking of Max being real, [he shared how he really feels about #2 drivers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fqpgvi/scuderiafemboy_max_in_his_new_viaplay_documentary/)

One of F1‚Äôs biggest ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù drivers, Stoffel Vandoorne, sat down for an interview for the official Formula 1 website covering [‚Äúracing for McLaren, partnering Alonso, and more‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fs4476/vandoorne_on_racing_for_mclaren_partnering_alonso/). My man had some abysmal luck and timing.

1ftgify,Jean Alesi‚Äôs career could‚Äôve seriously turned out differently in the 90‚Äôs,"Jean Alesi in my opinion was one of the top talents of Formula One in the 90s, and had maybe the best car control + heaps of raw speed. He was incredible in the wet and a very passionate racer but unfortunately he suffered from Ferrari producing mainly unreliable cars that ruined his chances. He walked away with 1 memorable win at Montreal in 1995, but his career could've been much different. 

In 1990, after his incredible season with Tyrell, everyone wanted a piece of him. He actually had a contract for Williams in 1991, but some behind the scenes drama occurred. The announcement was supposed to come at the French Grand Prix, but kept getting delayed after Mansells ""retirement at the British GP"" and Sennas increasing talks with Williams added to the confusion with not a heap of transparency on Frank's behalf to my understanding. By September Alesi backed out of the contract after the announcement was still not being made and went with Ferrari. 

Alesi's driving style was similar to Senna's and Mansell's. He could've been incredible quick and 100% have a chance at the WDC driving the active suspension Williams cars of 92' and 93', that thrived on an aggressive driver, then that makes me wonder what Senna could've done at Williams in 92 and 93. Imagine Senna/Alesi in the FW14B, I can't imagine anything else than them taking pole and winning every race! 

Ultimately Alesi at Ferrari ""should've"" won the following races had poor unreliability and other unforeseen circumstances not befallen him :

1991 Belgian Grand Prix 
1994 Italian Grand Prix 
1995 Italian Grand Prix
1995 Japanese Grand Prix 
1996 Monaco Grand Prix

He could've turned out so much different if he was at Williams

1fteo1r,I am a fan of the DRS,"There are many critics of the DRS because it supposedly makes overtaking artificially easy in F1. But I tend to think of it as opening up more challenges that engineers, drivers, and strategists have to overcome, which really pushes cars to the limit.

Example, because of DRS, design teams have to push the limits of aerodynamics to design cars that are so fast and drivers have to almost perfect their form so that they can break away from a fast DRS-assisted car chasing them. Which is why when Lando Norris' Mclaren broke away from Max's Red Bull (we need you to pull away by 5 seconds) in Singapore, I was in awe. What a freaking fast car that even a DRS-assisted car driven by Max was left behind. That is pushing car engineering to its limit!

The use of DRS also removed the monotony of undercut as a strategy. Before when one successfully implements an undercut, it is almost sure victory as track position can overcome the tire offset in the next stint. But now, staying out long is becoming a viable strategy in the arsenal of drivers and strategists. Example, Alex Albon in this season's Baku. Charles in Singapore. Teams can now think of both undercut and staying out long as strategic options.

Finally, the use of DRS made us witness truly great defensive driving that was able to hold back even DRS-assisted opponents behind. Charles vs Hamilton in Monza 2019. This season, the Oscar vs Charles battle in Baku was so freaking tense that just one defensive lapse coinciding with one brave offensive move decided the battle. Russell vs Hamilton in Spa.

So yeah, I am a fan of the use of DRS. Pushed aerodynamics to the limit and really opened up more options in race strategy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fteo1r/i_am_a_fan_of_the_drs/,2024-10-01 03:29:28,"11 days, 8:49:43.101064",105,103,2024-10-12 12:19:11

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

1fqoapj,"using amateur data analysis to compare ""pure"" driving ability","hello all, as we're settling down from the danny ricc news, i found myself under the weight of a heavy workload morning and filled with angst about this long post-summer break. so of course, i decided to look at some F1 stats and thought up of this non-serious data analysis of F1 drivers for our collective amusement and/or outrage. 

*note, i cooked this up in literally a couple hours. i am not a data analyst, just an out-of-practice former software engineer with just enough knowledge to be dangerous. i'll try to be upfront about flaws in this but i wouldn't put too much weight on this either*

### the concept

i've always wondered how to compare a driver like hamilton with a driver like goatifi. they're both once-in-a-generation drivers but it's impossible to tease out their relative pure driving talent unless they're both using the same car. but hey! they both raced against russell in equal machinery, so we should be able to compare them by normalizing against russell. 

the general idea is to calculate relative performance as a ratio b/w one driver to another on the same machinery. this ratio would be the trimmed mean of their laptimes in the most recent *x* races against one another under the same constructor. 

a ratio of exactly 1 would mean that the two drivers are equivalent in driving skill. a value greater than 1 would mean driver1 is slower than driver2 (and vice-versa). the more recent the pairing, the better. 

then, since many drivers end up driving for different teams and/or teammates, i can build a web (or graph) linking all those drivers together. finally, i can compare two drivers in that graph and find their relative performance by calculating the product of all those ratios as we traverse the graph from one driver to another. 

### the methodology

- first, data. i was amazed to learn that there is an amazing and updated store of f1 statistics via [Ergast](https://ergast.com/mrd/) which collects some stats even from 1950. it's **amazing** -- they have data available via an api, but i just opted to download their static tables (as of today) to load into python. i didn't do much in the way of data cleaning, and i did notice one crazy outlier by chance (and corrected it) but there could be others. 

- some variables. i came up with 3 variables that i could adjust to make things easier (ie. smaller datatables for my poor ancient macbook pro).

  - `MIN_YEAR`: this is the lowest year i would use laptime data from. i settled on 2000 for now

  - `TRIM_AMOUNT`: set this to 0.1 to exclude 10% of outlier laptimes for each race for each driver. this wasn't set scientifically, just plucked a number out of the air that felt right. 10% would be 6 laps in a 60 lap race. 

  - `MAX_COMP_RACES`: i chose to only take a certain amount of the most recent races for any two drivers on the same machinery. i settled on 1.5x of a season's worth of races, or 36.
 


- data prep. i had to create many datatables for this analyis. one was for determining the unique driver pairs (UDP) under the same constructor. 

  then i created a table calculating the trimmed mean laptimes for each of the drivers per race. some issues here are since i take the trimmed mean of each race and compare them b/w drivers driving for the same constructor in a race, it doesn't take into account things like different strategy, different tires, different starting grid positions, different upgrade packages, etc. the process assumes that everyone racing under the same constructor name in a race is on equal footing. 

  then i calculate the ratios b/w the averaged laptimes b/w each UDP. finally, i take the (up to) 36 most recent races for each UDP and average those race ratios together to come up with a final ratio for each. 


- the graph. i opted to use the networkx library as it pained me to try and conjure up dijkstra's algorithm from my memory of college courses like 20 years ago. 

  using the UDPs and the time since they last raced together, i added drivers as vertexes and the time since their pairing as edge weights. the idea was to link two drivers together using dijkstra's to get the shortest path (as defined by time since pairing) b/w any two drivers. 

  for example, to link hamilton to goatifi, dijkstra's would see that hamilton and russell raced together only a few days ago and russell and goatifi raced together almost 3 years ago and that's the shortest path between them. 

  a more interesting case (and illustrative of some of the drawbacks) is linking hamilton to alonso. even tho they raced against each other in equal machinery more than a decade ago, the shortest path algorithm comes up with this route: <'hamilton', 'russell', 'latifi', 'de_vries', 'tsunoda', 'gasly', 'ocon', 'alonso'> since the sum of the times since each of those pairings comes out to a little less than 10 yrs.

  the difference in the final ratios is slight and at the very least in the same direction, so it seems to be generally consistent.

- the final link. here it was a matter of putting the pieces together and creating a function that can do all the math and spit out the relative performance metric. here's an example 

(`WEIGHT` is simply the number of years since their pairing, `RATIO` is the driver1_avg_laptime/driver2_avg_laptime, `#` is the number of races together that go into the computed ratio, `MOST_RECENT` is the last time they raced together



    DRIVER1              DRIVER2              CONSTRUCTOR  WEIGHT RATIO    #  MOST_RECENT
    -------------------  -------------------  -----------  ------ -------- -- -----------

    russell              latifi               williams     2.7899 0.986169 36 2021-12-12
    
    overall ratio:  0.985494
    OR hamilton IS 1.4506 % FASTER THAN latifi

that settles that once and for all!

here's one b/w liam lawson and danny ricc:

    DRIVER1              DRIVER2              CONSTRUCTOR  WEIGHT RATIO    #  MOST_RECENT

    overall ratio:  1.015308
    OR sainz IS 1.5078 % SLOWER THAN albon

couple interesting notes here, there's a number of driver links with this combo where the driver only shared 1 race together (the ones with bearman and the hulk/checo pairing), which is a pretty weak link cumulatively. again, this is just for fun, so take it with a big wheelbarrow of salt. also, the checo/max perf disparity is one of the biggest of the current crop of UDPs, so any link that utilizes this pairing is going to be very skewed, fair or not. 

the lowest hanging fruit here for improvement is probably to alter the edge weights in the graph to be some kind of combination of # of races together and time since racing together. there's also the question (brought up in the HAM/ALO linking) whether direct competition from many years ago is better than many links from recent times. happy to take suggestions here from those more knowledgeable than me. 


### final thoughts

this was a fun quick project to whip up. let me know if you want to see any other driver pairings (from drivers in the past 20 yrs). i'll do my best to keep my real work at bay to post any good pairings. it would take some time to put together a public google sheet to host ALL pairings and i might get to it at some point in the future, but this was just to get some feedback to see what i could improve. if it makes sense, i'll post a refined version in the future. if anyone has some good questions/feedback on the methodology happy to look into those as well. thanks for reading!",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fqoapj/using_amateur_data_analysis_to_compare_pure/,2024-09-27 13:55:14,"14 days, 22:23:59.121548",8,9,2024-10-12 12:19:13

T√§nak meanwhile had something very interesting to say, seemingly standing strong with Ogier.

‚ÄúQuite interesting times at the moment, not sure how much we can say,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut still living the dream and enjoying to drive the cars.‚Äù

Stage 1 ending - both Ogier and T√§nak don't say much and subtly hinting that they can't say what they would actually say.

Will see how much they will keep this going on during the weekend. Wonder if they are protesting because Ogier got fined last rally about beeing critical or this involves the Max thing aswell?

1fqk944,What's next for Ricciardo?,"Several options:-

- driving for another team in F1 (see below)
- another series like Indy in the USA
- commentating on Sky F1 (with Villeneuve!)
- straight retirement, disappear
- Honda car dealership
- team management role with e.g. RB
- coaching drivers 
- driver management, like Mark Webber
- junior team owner in F3/F2
- paddock hanger-on for a while 

Unless something shifts at a team like Kick or Williams, he's probably done in F1. But I wouldn't rule it out that one of those kind of teams might offer him a late lifeline for 2025. Bottas said his deal isn't signed, Albon looks slightly sus against Colapinto and if he doesn't perform in the next 6 races might be in a weak position, and Ricciardo's profile (and another comeback story) would be a massive boost for some teams. Can't create the results for sponsors on track? Create them off track. DR will be cheap.

More likely Indy in my opinion. It's a payday and he will shine there, European-type drivers (I know he is Aussie) usually do. And he likes the USA for sure, it suits his showy style and his media appeal.

Commentating etc? Maybe, if he hangs up the helmet. But only then I think, not before.

I doubt he will disappear. He likes the spotlight too much, and his appeal now is his huge profile.

1fq3tpx,I don't know how much more I can take as a Red Bull fan,"Hi everyone. This may be a long post, so bare with me.

Like many F1 fans, I got into the sport due to Drive to Survive, and one of the first drivers I was introduced to Daniel Riccardo. His outgoing personality made him fun to watch. In many ways, I became a Red Bull fan because of him. I also grew up in the action sports community so I was very familiar with how Red Bull as a larger organization was pushing the boundaries of things and doing edgy marketing stunts.

While I loved seeing Max and Lewis compete in the 2021 drivers championship and give F1 fans a new world champion the enthusiasm I had when I first got into the sport has shifted. The PR over the last few years has been awful and it really started when Max wasn't willing to be a team player and give Checho the win in Brazil. Over the last year it just seems like things have gotten worse with different scandals at Red Bull and now dropping Riccardo in an awful way. He deserved so much more of an exit.

I'm now at a point, where I've been finding myself cheering for Lando as he chases down Max in the WDC. (Is this normal or am I the only one?) In summary, I'm just disappointed in the situation and wish Red Bull and RB handled the situation differently.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fq3tpx/i_dont_know_how_much_more_i_can_take_as_a_red/,2024-09-26 18:52:17,"15 days, 17:26:56.121919",0,202,2024-10-12 12:19:13

1fpth45,What happens to drivers who don't make it.,"Edit (Ok maybe i Shld rephrase my title as it may sound a little offensive): What happens to drivers who dont't reach F1 or other top categories like Formula E, Indycar

Hey everyone! I've been curious about what happens to drivers in lower categories like F2, F3, F4, W Series, and karting who don't make it to F1. We all see f1 drivers earning millions but what we don‚Äôt see is the 500-1000+ different drivers in f2 f3 f4 karting who have spent hundreds of thousands or even millions and don‚Äôt get much recognition. 

Given that many of these drivers spend years racing and likely spend less time on traditional education, what do they end up doing when their racing careers stall or end, especially if they‚Äôre in their 20s by then? Do they just go to university, graduate late, and find a regular job?

This thought came to mind when I found out about how drivers usually progress from Karting -> F4 -> F3 -> F2 -> F1. Much like moving up a pyramid, only 20 drivers are at the top meaning that there is a whole world of other drivers who maybe dreamt of F1 and did not reach it . I can't help but be empathetic given how much time and money they spent into it (Pretty sure at least a few are not rich and might have gotten a loan etc).",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fpth45/what_happens_to_drivers_who_dont_make_it/,2024-09-26 11:02:37,"16 days, 1:16:36.122298",86,94,2024-10-12 12:19:13

1fpp7sy,"Did F1 drivers, or F1 in general, inspire you to better yourself somehow?","Working out this morning, I was thinking how this is the first time in my life I managed more than 1-2 days of working out before getting bored/discouraged, and what inspired me about 1,5 years ago was some interviews where Carlos nad Lewis said they don't really like working out, outright hate it sometimes, but of course they do it anyway. 

(I'm much closer to Lewis' age that Carlos'; been strugling with this for many...decades)

My next goal is trying to improve on my sleep habits, hearing that Lando is also doing it as a fellow night owl, lol.

So I was wondering, did anybody else better themselves being inspired by something  a driver (or any other F1 person) said or did? And if yes, how?

1fpa5ji,"If you were a billionaire with a racing driver son, would you do what Lawrence Stroll has done for Lance?","Lance Stroll gets a lot of stick for being a rich kid racing with daddy's money. 

But I wonder if you too wouldn't do what Lawrence or Lance Stroll have done if you had the means and opportunity? 

If you were a mega rich father, and could easily finance his racing career, why not do it? He's your son. And if you can afford to buy a team, why not do that?

If your family was ultra wealthy, and that's what you really wanted to do, why not use your advantage to achieve your dream?

A lot of the criticism is because Lance underperforms Alonso - someone generally recognized as one of the best drivers ever in F1 - even though a few years ago he did quite OK, and he has won quite serious junior championships like the FIA F3 championship, with Prema (naturally). 

But his family has invested mightily in Aston Martin: invested in very serious partner drivers like Vettel and Alonso, invested in massive new infrastructure like wind tunnels, and relationships with top tier engine manufacturers, and now in Adrian Newey. They generally act like someone taking it very seriously.

I think most fans, if they were multi-billionaires like the Strolls, would invest that money in a heartbeat in themselves or their offspring, and perhaps the Stroll family have done way more than the minimum to get their child in a team.

1foyelg,"(OT) Looking for something to fill the gulf left in the 4 week F1 fall break? Why not check out this season of the other top level prototype FIA championship, WEC?","WEC is now my favourite racing series in the world, and I've been a F1 fan for 12 years. WEC stands for World Endurance Championship. The races start at 6 hours - which might sound like a lot but they fly by. There are two classes, a GT3 class and the Le Mans Hypercar class. This year 37 cars compete on track at the same time every race, with many more for Le Mans. 

The racing is top notch and it's not too much to add to a motorsport diet with only 8 races a year extra to follow.

They have currently 8 manufacturer teams and two extra privateer entries in the Hypercar prototype class. This is similar to a F1 car but with a roof, and a bit slower. They are all large car manufacturer brands, though this isn't a requirement. Aston Martin are joining next year and Hyundai's Genesis brand joining in '26 or '27, and McLaren rumoured to have heavy interest too. That's more manufacturers currently than F1, with more to come as the cherry on top.

All of the Hypercars have a basically free engine, though there are limits on maximum power and so on for fairness. The Cadillac has most people's favourite engine, a N/A high capacity crossplane crank V8 that roars. Aston Martin next year will have my new favourite racing engine, a high displacement N/A Cosworth V12 that screams.

The races are actually available for free on YouTube a while after the fact so you can check out Fuji, the most recent race, if you're interested here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aNlfSOh4ks&t=1772. If you don't have the time pull up the link and throw it in your watch later playlist!

The premier race every season in WEC is Le Mans, which I'm sure race fans like yourself will have at all heard of. This race is on the Le Mans streets, a track that includes the famed 4.2mi (6.8km) long La Sarthe straight (which has had two chicanes since '90). This is famously a 24 hour race, that has existed for over 100 years. One of the big draws to WEC - for example Ferrari are basically there to win Le Mans, with a car design that favours the circuit at the detriment of performance at many other circuits if previous performance has been anything to go by, and Max Verstappen amongst other F1 drivers has said he wants to do the race, and Alonso being a previous winner.

Le Mans 2024 link - https://youtu.be/XTqHhCzcQhw?si=qy6yBgnMNptKddUY&t=3593

The designs are interesting. They are mostly hybrids with free engine choice, which makes for some variety of sounds on track. The car aerodynamics in particular are limited in a downforce to drag coefficient, so that the designers of the cars can incorporate design features from road cars, as well as to keep performance spending down. Both of these reasons are why we have such an influx of manufacturers (from 4 in 2022, to 7 last year, to 8 this year). It does mean the cars are slower than back in the F1 style uninhibited performance crazy spending LMP1 era, but personally I really like the on track product of the hypercars, with the beauty, quantity of cars (LMP1 peaked low and tailed off badly due to costs), and how the cars can push around eachother with lower downforce numbers than F1 giving less aerodynamic wake.

Still interested? I'll give you some more information then!

There's two different subclasses of Hypercar chassis types. LMH, or Le Mans Hypercar, originally coming from the WEC regulations, and LMDh, or Le Mans Daytona h (the h is undefined, could mean hypercar or hybrid but they never made it one thing) coming from the IMSA DPi regulations.

The two regulations were brought closer together in a convergence agreement so the two different kinds of car could compete on track at the same time. So this means that actually there is also IMSA if you wind up enjoying sportscars with the same cars as well - though with about half the entries of WEC's Hypercar class, and not one LMH car until next year with a part season entry from Aston Martin. They are also called GTP in IMSA, an abbreviation of Grand Touring Prototype. This is a throwback to the original name for Group C cars in IMSA in the 80s, the famous prototypes that raced the Le Mans streets like the Mazda 787b, the Jaguar XJR-9 and the Porsche 962.

IMSA is the mostly US domestic series (one race in Canada for the lulz) that has a similar rule structure and the same cars as WEC.

There are some difference between the cars. LMDh cars are more common. They come from a standard chassis from one of four chassis manufacturers. These are Dallara, Ligier, Oreca and Multimatic. They have a standard hybrid mechanism, and other standard parts besides. The hybrid supplies drive to the rear axle. This is the cheap option.

LMH cars can be hybrid, or not hybrid. The hybrid can go to the front axle if desired - which is what has been elected for by all hybrid LMH teams that have competed so far. The cars can be fully custom, and have a custom chassis. This is the expensive option.

Porsche, Alpine, Lamborghini, Cadillac, BMW have LMDh chassis. Hyundai in 2026 is suspected to be going for a LMDh chassis.

Ferrari, Peugeot, Toyota have LMH Hybrid chassis. Aston Martin will have a non hybrid LMH chassis. Former Manufacturers Glickenhaus and Vanwall had non hybrid Chassis. Former and potential rejoining manufacturer Isotta Fraschini had a Hybrid chassis.

The cars are controlled in performance by a system called Balance of Performance, or BoP. So the cars have to be in the aero window, but through simulation and through track data they make additions to weight, removal of power etc in order to make it more possible for everybody to have a chance.

If you got to the bottom of this thanks for giving me the time of day, and definitely check out the races later if you don't have the time to right now (e.g. work break). And if you do have some time now, why not throw on one of the races I linked if you made it this far?

1fneq5h,15 Years Without a Championship: What's Holding Ferrari Back?,"One thing I don‚Äôt understand about Ferrari is how we are so consistently inconsistent. We won our last championship more than 15 years ago, and in all that time, we haven‚Äôt provided our drivers with a car or a team capable of winning another. In 2022 we got a very good car but reliability issues, strategy mistakes and lack of development throughout the season, whoever is managing the team clearly doesn‚Äôt understand what it takes. I believe Elkann is the problem, since he became the majority stakeholder around 2012, Ferrari has been in decline.

During that time, Red Bull has had two dominant eras, Mercedes ruled for almost a decade, and now McLaren looks like they have a car that could challenge for both the Constructors‚Äô and Drivers‚Äô Championships. Meanwhile, Ferrari, since 2007, hasn‚Äôt managed to build a truly dominant car like those top three teams have.

It‚Äôs frustrating to see the team with such history and resources fail to deliver time and time again.

What do you think guys what is holding us(Ferrari) back?

# Singapore 2024



**Qualifying:**

P1. Lando Norris

P2. Max Verstappen

P3. Lewis Hamilton



**Race:**

P1. Lando Norris

P2. Max Verstappen

P3. Oscar Piastri



Welp, if I may, the Singapore Grand Prix was a snoozer, thanks to a stark lack of chaos and absence of tension in the closing stages like we had last year.

Hopes and dreams for more thrilling races aside, the 2024 season is winding down with just 6 rounds remaining‚Ä¶ And Max‚Äôs gap back to Lando in the WDC is dwindling too with another 7 points being nibbled away, leaving a 52 point margin. I daresay it‚Äôll come down to the wire and the odds rest somewhat in Max‚Äôs favour, but being overtaken isn‚Äôt out of the question.

**Other notable moments from Singapore include:**

* Ferrari pulling off some mighty fine strategic moves to vault Carlos and Charles up the order from 10th and 9th to 7th and 5th, respectively.

* Newcomer Franco Colapinto making a bold move at the start to sneak himself into the points, before waiting one lap too long to pit and being undercut by seasoned midfielder, Checo Perez.

* My astute predictions coming true that Lewis would complain about pitting too early, then struggling on the hard tires, and why on earth they let George undercut him.

*(I wrote the entry above while making the logical the assumption that Liam Lawson would take the cockpit beginning in 2025, but an unexpected whirlwind of unanimous whispers indicate that* [*we just witnessed Danny Ric‚Äôs final race*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fn1zx7/kym_illman_daniel_has_left_the_paddock_it_was_an/) *in Formula 1. I‚Äôll confess to having no special love for DR3, but I believe the way Red Bull has handled this circumstance is awfully poor, especially for someone they‚Äôve advocated for so ferociously in recent years. They could have* at least *made a proper announcement so the man‚Äîand the fans‚Äîcould embrace his final race with ceremony, rather than fending off rumour-driven questions.*

*Despite his probable-final race being one to forget, Danny boy channelled a bit of George Constanza‚Äôs spirit to go out on a high note by making the ‚Äúpeculiar‚Äù (*[*according to Zak Brown*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fmvf5f/chris_medland_zak_brown_says_he_will_ask/)*) call to* [*take the fastest lap point from Lando‚Äîdone with his good friend Max‚Äôs championship battle in mind‚Ä¶*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fmwfeg/ricciardo_took_fastest_lap_point_off_norris_with/)

*And was* [*rewarded with Driver Of The Day for his efforts and service*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fmtxk0/f1_daniel_ricciardo_is_your_f1driveroftheday/)*.)*

Okay, moving on...

Potentially dashing my hopes of Gabriel Bortoleto graduating into Formula 1 with Sauberaudi, [James Vowles is willing to work with Sauber to secure a seat for Franco Colapinto in 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fi2uw4/motorsport_james_vowels_is_willing_to_work_with/). Franco‚Äôs name ain‚Äôt Gabriel, but given the guts and balls he‚Äôs shown in just three races, that would be a seat well-earned.

That being said, Young Bortoleto rumours have continued at pace with rumblings emerging that Gabriel impressed so well during his recent McLaren test that Sauberaudi want him on a 4-year deal, which is insane for a rookie. However, [McLaren are reluctant, only wanting him on loan for two years with the option to scoop him up for 2027](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fjuqgq/motorsport_italy_f1_bortoleto_mclaren_opens_loan/). Silly season keeps on sillying!

*(If you feel so inclined,* [*The Race‚Äôs interview with Bortoleto*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fjzhss/meet_the_alonsomclaren_protege_with_a_2025_f1_shot/) *offers some nice insight into his junior career, character, and how he‚Äôs wrangled himself to being on the cusp of arriving in Formula 1 next year.)*

Behind the scenes (or perhaps next to them), Fernando Alonso‚Äîwhose driver management company, A14, manages Mr. Bortoleto‚Äîbelieves it‚Äôs only [‚Äúa matter of time‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fivqec/alonso_sees_f1_debut_for_young_star_as_a_matter/) until the young Brazilian arrives in Formula 1. Hear hear!

That all being said, there are rumblings (of uncertain credibility) that [Lord of the Mullets Valtteri Bottas *has* extended his career with Sauberaudi by one more year](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1flg06e/roger_benoit_has_been_told_by_a_team_principal/). Time will tell‚Äîbut for what it‚Äôs worth, Valtteri himself shared that nothing is signed, but feels [his negotiations are moving in the right direction](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fmqdba/adam_cooper_valtteri_bottas_on_sauberaudi_i/).

\~\~\~

# The Teams‚Äô Twistings & Turnings

After just two races behind the wheel of a slowly-but-surely improving Williams, [Franco Colapinto is proving to be the right decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fi8hdz/after_just_2_f1_races_franco_colapinto_is_proving/). While I know he‚Äôs most likely in the best iteration of the Williams machine from the past two years, I can‚Äôt help but wonder how much Logan dragged the team down.

You know a team has a problem when entire articles emerge analysing how and why they‚Äôre in a sticky situation. In this case, The Race has examined [why Oscar Piastri‚Äôs killer instinct will keep making McLaren‚Äôs driver calls harder](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fisnvy/piastris_killer_instinct_will_keep_making/)‚Ä¶ And harder‚Ä¶ And harder. Touted not so long ago as a future WDC, watching the chinks in Lando emerge is curiously fascinating. Lando, of course, has the potential, opportunity, and ability to shore up his weak spots in the seasons to come‚Ä¶ *But will he?*

Sith Lord Christian Horner has vowed that [Red Bull must attack *now* after losing the Constructors lead to McLaren](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fitm84/christian_horner_red_bull_must_attack_now_after/), but *this* Formula 1 fan is sceptical, finding that claim rather wishy-washy. After all, you can only attack effectively from a position of strength‚Äîwhich Red Bull has not been in.

One of the more famous men on the mic these days, Gianpiero Lambiase‚ÄîMax‚Äôs race engineer‚Äî[will become Red Bull‚Äôs Head of Racing in 2026](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fjpcjg/nate_saunders_gianpiero_lambiase_longtime_race/) as part of a restructuring in the wake of Jonathan Wheatley leaving.

\~\~\~

# Technical Tidbits

Sith Lord Christian Horner has also revealed that [Red Bull‚Äôs first development mistake](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fi5ox6/christian_horner_reveals_first_mistake_made_in/)‚Äîperhaps the ticket to their downfall‚Äîwas their Barcelona 2023 floor upgrade. If only they could sneak a time machine into their catering budget‚Ä¶

Continuing the conversation on this year‚Äôs flexi-wing drama, [McLaren‚Äôs rear wing trickery in Baku appears to be legal, albeit sneaky](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fivk12/seems_like_mclarens_rear_wing_is_legal_but_sneaky/). Regardless, [Lando is proud of the mini-DRS](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fkl4yy/norris_proud_of_mclarens_minidrs_effect_after/) McLaren has baked into their wing‚Ä¶ And [the FIA has stated that their shenanigans are legal](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fkie78/fia_says_mclaren_rear_wing_complies_with_rules/). However, don‚Äôt be surprised if the FIA‚Äôs load testing changes next year to make little tricks like this a no-go.

Case in point, McLaren have made [an official statement about their Baku rear wing](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1flb950/chris_medland_mclaren_statement_on_its_rear_wing/) following discussions with the FIA, and are [obliged to adapt said wing moving forward](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1flb5ec/mclaren_must_adapt_controversial_rear_wing_the/). May we all move on now.

On the subject of wings and bits, [this post contains a nice little slideshow](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fl96av/a_few_upgrades_for_some_teams_this_weekend/) and simple explanation of the various upgrades the teams brought to Singapore.

# For Funsies

The FIA is [introducing a new officials department](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fi6r4g/ot_fia_introduces_new_officials_department_to/) with a goal of providing a centralised approach for appointing FIA officials for 2025 and beyond. *Hmm, yes‚Ä¶ I see. Sounds so nice and official!*

Speaking of the FIA, they‚Äôre in hot water with Max Verstappen (who has the support of the rest of the drivers) after fining him for swearing in their press conference, with talks of further clamping down on ‚Äúno-no words.‚Äù Max responded with [a hilariously churlish post-qualifying press conference performance](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fm5a21/q_how_much_did_you_change_on_the_car_overnight/), and then gave an interview sharing [how his love for F1 diminished after this punishment](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fmyize/erik_van_haren_after_a_second_place_for_many_a/) (translation is in the post comments).¬†

If you want to know who has scored the most points over the last 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 races prior to Singapore, your answer is [Oscar Piastri](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fi3nnd/f1guydan_if_you_want_to_know_who_has_scored_the/) across the board.

Titillated Redditor u/frozensand has done us all a favour in confessing their [love for the smell of a brand new (safety) car](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fi1bf8/i_love_the_smell_of_a_brand_new_car/). I can‚Äôt say I blame them.

Bwoooah! [Lewis Hamilton equalled Kimi ‚ÄòThe Iceman‚Äô Raikkonen‚Äôs career race start tally](https://www.instagram.com/p/DABauTuK1iQ/) in Baku, and [hit the 350 starts threshold in Singapore](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fmrdpa/another_incredible_milestone_for_lewis_go_well_in/).

If you feel like living in the past (one week ago), [Fred Vasseur identifies where the Azerbaijan GP went wrong for Charles](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fip6wp/we_had_the_pace_to_win_vasseur_identifies_where/), despite having the pace to win.

Enjoy this oh-so-cool blast to the past when [Formula 1 used a thermal camera in their broadcast](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fjrv5t/why_was_the_thermal_camera_removed/). This was one of my favourite views back in the day, but alas, the teams didn‚Äôt like their tire temps being so easily read into. Boo hiss grrr.

If you dig the dulcet tones of James Vowles, you‚Äôll enjoy his interview with WSJ News: [On Williams Racing, how to win in Formula 1, and ‚Äúmore‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fkhk7d/f1s_james_vowles_on_williams_racing_how_to_win_in/).

You can also meet China‚Äôs first Formula 1 driver (who is likely-exiting-the-paddock-in-2025) [Zhou Guanyu and his cat, Sweetcorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fkgmvv/meet_chinas_first_f1_driver_and_his_pet_cat/).

Lewis looks a treat [rocking the double denim](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fkfue7/lewis_arriving_in_double_denim_for_media_day/) for Singapore media day‚Ä¶ And [again on free practice Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fl79wz/lewis_arriving_on_friday/).

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

1fmv05z,Verstappen and Ferrari could pull off something noone has done since Nelson Piquet,"Okay, so with the Contructors' being a pretty big struggle for Red Bull this year I got curious. Has anyone got a Drivers' title with a constructor that ended up P3 or worse that year?

Apparently this has happened twice. Hell, 55 out of 66 times the Drivers' and the Constructors' went to the same team. (Worth noting that Contructors' titles are only awarded since 1958.)

The last one to pull this off was Nelson Piquet with Brabham in 1983. That year he got the tilte with 59 points with his teammate Riccardo Patrese only scoring 13. This meant Brabham only got third in the Contructors' behind Ferrari and Renault.

The only other time someone managed this feat was coincidentally the year before, 1982. Keke Rosberg ended up winning the Drivers' with 44 points that year, but his team, Williams, got P4 in the Contructor's thanks to Derek Daly managing to get only 8 points.

Just for kicks I also checked the 8 seasons where only individual titles were handed out. Sure enough, a lot was different back then, but it seems every year the car that the champion was driving also would've done quite well in a team championship as well (e.g. Farina won the first title in an Alfa Romeo. P2 and P3 that year also drove an Alfa Romeo)

This whole thing of course doesn't matter too much but I find it quite interesting that it only happened twice in 60+ years and it's also been quite a while.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fmv05z/verstappen_and_ferrari_could_pull_off_something/,2024-09-22 14:48:13,"19 days, 21:31:03.445249",54,16,2024-10-12 12:19:16

1fmugo4,Daniel Ricciardo talks about impending announcement to Portuguese TV.,"Ricciardo was asked if there is announcement due tomorrow, or this week, and if he knows what it includes. Was also asked how he looks back at his career and if his mind is at peace.

Daniel Ricciardo replied he knows what's coming and that he looks back at his career very fondly, namely his 13 years in formula one, and that he never imagined he'd make it to formula one when he was in karts as a kid.

Daniel also discussed it further by saying he's completely at peace with himself knowing that he gave it all for his entire formula one career. Says he tried to be the best driver in the world every day of his career and that it didn't materialise but that it's fine because he gave it his all and his all was plenty.

For me, this pretty much confirms that Daniel is out. What do you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fmugo4/daniel_ricciardo_talks_about_impending/,2024-09-22 14:23:54,"19 days, 21:55:22.445548",3667,475,2024-10-12 12:19:16

With Daniel taking FL in this race, this is no longer the case. Win + FL in all remaining races with Max in second isn't enough, as he would end up one point short of the title. This means that to get the championship now, regardless of what he does, he needs Max to not finish 2nd at least once till the end of the season.

This isn't a permanent stat, if Max were to finish 3rd next race with a Lando win then Win + FL would again be enough to secure it, but it goes to show how tight it's going to be if Red Bull doesn't struggle again (and also why that Daniel fastest lap was so crucial), and how his championship hopes are slowly sliding away.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fmu53a/lando_norris_cant_guarantee_wdc_by_winning_every/,2024-09-22 14:09:11,"19 days, 22:10:05.445635",248,249,2024-10-12 12:19:16

1fmalc1,Should F2 and F3 race weekends be on different days than F1?,"EDIT: There have been plenty of reasons listed in the comments as to why this wouldn't work, mainly including circuit costs, popularity decrease and the value of the F1 association. Thanks guys for pointing out my oversights.




As we know, junior series are expensive. Too expensive. Additionally, both f1 drivers and their mechanics - especially the mechanics - are overworked and tired from the schedule. Seemingly unrelated problems, right? The idea proposed in the title suggests otherwise. Btw, I saved the best till last, so make sure you actually read until the end.

Say we removed 8 circuits from the f1 calendar, to make it 16 races long. That would allow for the removal of double and triple headers, significantly reducing workloads. This inadvertedly makes the racing better, as both drivers and the crew would be in a better condition. But, for us fans, this is awful, right? Not necessarily. In fact, it could be better than a 24 race calendar. If we were to remove f2 and f3 double headers too, we could place those races in the gaps in the calendar. Provided enough planning, this could maybe even provide racing EVERY WEEK excluding summer and winter breaks. 

But surely we miss out on racing, right? Again, it could be even better with this schedule. Its no secret f2 and f3 produce better racing. If f1 could hype these like they do with their f1 events, this means so many new fans would be exposed to f2 and f3. This means we can see who cracks under pressure, allowing for the f1 transition to be smaller. Additionally, as there are less f1 races in the calendar now, each race becomes more valuable, meaning each team would push even harder, making for some incredible events.

This also could solve the problem with sprint races. Say the bottom 5 f1 teams from last year are invited to two sprint races seperate from the calendar (sprints would be removed in the normal calendar, ideally). Say the grid order would be a reverse grid from the f1.5 standings last year. With the current sprint points format (lets say top 8/10 score), this could throw a massive curveball for backmarkers, with an incredible chance to earn points.

And now, the no.1 reason for this. The pi√©ce de resistance. As f2 and f3 would gain a massive influx of new viewers, this would mean more sponsors for teams, meaning higher profits, meaning teams can lower driver costs to try and get better drivers than other teams. Obviously, this could allow for generational level talents to come in that never would've had the chance prior due to budget.


So? What do you guys think? Any insights into this proposal would be great. Thanks for reading my weird idea.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fmalc1/should_f2_and_f3_race_weekends_be_on_different/,2024-09-21 19:17:03,"20 days, 17:02:14.968482",0,72,2024-10-12 12:19:17

Despite all that, what the FIA, or rather Ben Sulayem, decided to do is instead of making a public statement or a private inquiry, or a direct meeting between the parties, to come upon an agreement and make a decision to limit what is being includes into the live feed, like what was previously agreed upon in regards to team principals talking to (sometimes borderline nagging) the stewards. This statement or an inquiry or whatever could basically boil down to ""hey we want to uphold certain broadcast standards and so from this point and this date onwards, certain radio messages will not be heard"", explaining the reasoning behind perhaps avoiding possible damage to the public perception of the drivers due to how and what they say to the teams, after all this is a sport with often high stakes and people can frankly put a lot of dumb shit in the heat of the moment, happens to even the best of us.

What we got instead is something that comes across as a single party making a decision out of the blue, and not only is said decision accompanied by a ridiculously worded statement (I'm sure you've all seen the whole "" we're not rappers"" thing uttered by MBS himself), but less than 48 hours after the Foul Language regulations came into action we've had one of the drivers published directly, and it's already causing certain disruptions to the standard press/media proceedings after race weekend sessions, on top of the discourse currently taking place around F1 on social media and even among TV pundit teams

Doesn't it just feel like this situation could've been so easily avoided when one of the involved parties is quite literally in control, especially if it's really such a pressing matter that the head of FIA himself essentially has to enforce censorship?

Where do you stand on the subject? Do you agree drivers should clean it up verbally? Or should they be left alone and instead it's the broadcast feed that needs to be managed differently? Or maybe you think it's all just a nothingburger in the first place?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fm7gk8/the_recent_foul_language_regulation_feels_like/,2024-09-21 16:54:57,"20 days, 19:24:20.968611",153,79,2024-10-12 12:19:17

1fm6m2e,Comparing Lando and Oscar in Qualifying this season,"The H2H between Lando and Oscar in qualifying this season is now 14-4 to Lando (16-5 including sprints) to I thought it would be interesting to compare them - plus lots of people are chatting some absolute rubbish about the average gap between them! This is a pretty basic comparison and you could adjust for all sorts of things as I‚Äôm sure people much smarter than I am will do!!

So using the mean across all 21 sessions (using Q2 in Spain as Oscar set no time in Q3, and Q1 in Baku as Lando was knocked out), the average gap is 0.230 in Lando‚Äôs favour. However this is very misleading as it includes China sprint qualifying where Lando was over 3 seconds ahead of Oscar in the wet quali which massively skews the data.

Excluding that single session, the average gap using the mean is 0.089 in Lando‚Äôs favour. 

However you could compensate for excluding china sprint by adding a data point in its place using Lando‚Äôs next most dominant win over Oscar - which was 0.499 in Zandvoort. This brings the mean to 0.109.

You could go further in Lando‚Äôs favour and exclude Baku which brings the mean to 0.136.

Or you could just use the median to adjust for the various anomalies which probably is more useful. This gives an average gap of 0.108 in Lando‚Äôs favour.

My conclusion is that yes Lando has undoubtedly dominated Oscar in qualifying this year. But this highlights how the gap is nowhere near as big as the H2H suggests",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fm6m2e/comparing_lando_and_oscar_in_qualifying_this/,2024-09-21 16:16:12,"20 days, 20:03:05.968676",0,35,2024-10-12 12:19:17

We have seen Colapinto step into that car for the very first time and he has been able to match Albon right away (including Singapore as of FP3). Mind you, Albon has been at Williams for almost three seasons now. If a rookie like Colapinto is able to match Albon in only his first few weekends, it makes me wonder how good Albon actually is. Or is Colapinto a much bigger talent than we initially thought?

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika H√§kkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

Remember to keep it civil and welcoming! Gatekeeping within the Daily Discussion will subject users to disciplinary action.

This thread is a hub for general discussion and questions about Formula 1, that don't need threads of their own.

Are you new to Formula 1? This is the place for you. Ever wondered why it's called a lollipop man? Why the cars don't refuel during pitstops? Or when Mika will be back from his sabbatical? Ask any question you might have here, and the community will answer.

Also make sure you check out our [guide for new fans](/r/formula1/wiki/newtof1), and our [FAQ for new fans](/r/formula1/wiki/faq).

Are you a veteran fan, longing for the days of lollipop men, refueling during pitstops, and Mika H√§kkinen? This is the place to introduce new fans to your passion and knowledge of the sport.

Remember to keep it civil and welcoming! Gatekeeping within the Daily Discussion will subject users to disciplinary action.

1fktzba,Let's talk a little bit about Ollie Bearman!,"One thing we do think we know about Ollie at this point, he's got nerves of steel.  Came into some pretty tough situations, in 2 tracks that are known to be highly technical and difficult to master, and came away with points each time.

Of the two races, Baku was more impressive in my opinion, he had to fight for the points both times but the first time he was in a Ferrari, this time he was in a Haas.  

Bearman definitely got lucky when 2 cars crashed out in front of him and Hulkenberg decided, for what i can only assume to be reasons entirely of his own (did he have damage? Unsure, but it would explain), not to drive through to the flag, but he still put himself in a position to be there.

And TBH, even if Sainz, Perez, and for whatever reason Hulkenberg, didn't clear a path before him. P13 in a Haas wouldn't have been bad at all.

Bottom line, Bearman has showed me that he has the talent to compete at this level.  I don't know if he's a future winner, but the young man is a competitor and he may well give Esteban Ocon a run for his money next year.

In replacing Magnussen with Bearman I think it's clear that Haas and Komatsu have made a solid choice and that he'll earn his keep for the time being.  Kinda interested to see if he can grow into something more TBH, but at the very least, as he is now, the kid is interesting..",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fktzba/lets_talk_a_little_bit_about_ollie_bearman/,2024-09-19 20:18:04,"22 days, 16:01:17.761860",0,40,2024-10-12 12:19:21

Not a Red Bull fan by any stretch but I don‚Äôt see who would be able to pick up and run with it. 
Perhaps they could go after Oscar or Lando (I figure one has to go if they start fighting). The Racing Bulls haven‚Äôt been the place to bed the next star.
