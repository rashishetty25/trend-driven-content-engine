1g2mrdr,"Clever people, can you help...If F1 introduced fan-assisted down force, would that help the cars to race closer by reducing dirty air coming from the cars?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g2mrdr/clever_people_can_you_helpif_f1_introduced/,2024-10-13,0 days,0,24,2024-10-13 11:19:38,Technical,"I've just been watching a review of the ""McMurtry Spéirling Pure"" on the Top Gear Magazine youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPZxcfglU2Q) and it got me wondering if using fans to suck the cars to the road would help deal with the aerodynamic wash coming off the cars. However my engineering ability/understanding is essentially zero, so I need people who know what they're talking about to explain why it is or isn't a good idea.

\*Edit I already know about the BT46B - I asked the question more from the respect of an FIA rule change, rather than a specific innovation from one team :)
