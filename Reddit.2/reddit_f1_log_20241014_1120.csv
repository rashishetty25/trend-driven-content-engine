The hunt for the French engineers has already begun. Ferrari, Audi and Red Bull are seizing their chance.\n\nThe unions' fight was ultimately in vain. On September 30, Alpine's parent company Renault confirmed the end of its own engine production in Viry-Châtillon. In the middle of the year, Alpine had already announced that it wanted to use a customer engine from 2026 and convert the factory in Viry-Châtillon into a technology center. Talks with Mercedes about a new partnership are already well advanced behind the scenes.\n\nAfter it finally became clear at the end of September that there would be no more power units from Renault from 2026, the competition is now rubbing its hands together. Ferrari in particular did not hesitate for long. According to information from auto motor und sport, a few dozen engine engineers from Viry-Châtillon have already held job interviews with Ferrari. By hiring high-ranking Renault technicians, Ferrari could buy itself a decisive advantage.\n\nOn the one hand, the Scuderia would gain valuable knowledge, as a prototype for the new engine regulations from 2026 has already been running on the test bench at Renault since June of this year.

They can tell you about the direction and ideas that your competitors went down and what was promising or wasn't. There might be some diamonds in the rough. Let's not forget that Brawn's double diffuser idea came in part from Super Aguri which was dogwater.\n\nAlso, just because the end result isn't good, doesn't mean that the staff aren't good themselves.

1g2ozjd,Ferrari teammate qualifying gaps,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g2ozjd/ferrari_teammate_qualifying_gaps/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g2ozjd/ferrari_teammate_qualifying_gaps/,2024-10-13,0 days,"I was looking at the teammates gaps between Charles and Carlos this season to try and see what the gap usually is

Of course I am just manually looking, so there’s no adjustment for track length or anything.

But i was writing out what they usually are and i noticed something sort of interesting (doesn’t hold any actual importance though)

Charles has out-qualified Carlos by a  margin of 1-0.05 (in terms of a tenth) 6 times with 3 being under .10

And he’s out-qualified him by a margin of over 2 and a quarter tenths 7 times, 4 being over 3 and a half tenths

But he’s never out qualified Carlos within the range of 1 tenth to 2.25.
If you found the average of the usual gap Charles out-qualifies Carlos by it’s probably somewhere between this 2 numbers, but yet he’s never actually been in those numbers.

 You’d think that would be the most common gap, but instead either Charles is dominating or it’s insanely close.

Carlos’s gaps to Charles when he’s out qualified are more normal even with only 6 values.

It does probably hurt Charles if people find their average gap using the median, because their (unadjusted inaccurate just the physical numbers of the gaps) median difference

is +0.37 to Charles
but to the Charles side of that the numbers are 
+.73, +1, +2.25, +2.48, +2.63, + 3.54

and to Carlos side 
+0.08, +0.06, +0.05, -0.06, -1.04, -1.93

I just thought it was interesting how many times Charles and Carlos were neck and neck in qualifying and also how many times Carlos wasn’t really close at all and yet there was somehow never a middle ground between that ","[""If Sainz is on his best and Leclerc is not, they're very close, and Carlos can eek out a win. But if it's the opposite, Leclerc will most likely leave Sainz behind with a good margin.\n\nThis is probably the best year of Sainz as a F1 driver. The problem lies with the fact that Leclerc is also having one of the best seasons of his career."", 'For me, quali of SF-24 is hard to judge. Because it is a mediocre one in quali with significant tires warm-up issues. Btw, IMO Carlos may occasionally choose quali-preferred set-up a little bit or Charles may sometimes choose race-preferred set-up slightly. Because their race pace differences are bigger than the quali.(And IMO Carlos was not that type of guy who was significant faster on Saturday than Sunday before he joined Ferrari.) But it is just my guessing, no evidence to prove and I can be completely wrong lol.', 'Someone did a calculation of their average gap across their time as teammates and and it’s stayed [pretty consistent](https://x.com/formulaur_/status/1840076080926929202?s=46) across the years, near 0.130-0.150% favoring Leclerc.', 'In….checks notes…. six races, we aren’t going to have to discuss this any more, are we?  /s \n\n😀', 'Be interesting to see the Lewis Charles gap once Lewis has settled in of course. Actually, considering Leclerc is acknowledged to be one of the very best qualifiers the  gap with Carlos is closer than I thought it would be.', ""In a very general sense, when the car is suited to Charles, he's significantly quicker than Carlos.\n\nWhen the car isn't suited to Charles, it's extremely close."", 'I think it\'s because these cars are so temperamental, and Leclerc is more than likely going to be quicker in quali.\n\nGeorge and Lewis are seeing similar results. Everyone is like ""Lewis is getting obliterated in quali"" and he is, but it\'s by literal hundredths of a second on average.\n\nSometimes it\'ll jump to 1-2 tenths when he struggles with the tyres, but normally they\'re incredibly close, George is just getting that last few hundredths which keeps making it look like he\'s just demolishing him. \n\nPlus the top 7 are normally so close, if you\'re 1 tenth off your teammate, you\'re dropping 5-6 positions from where he\'s starting, so it makes the difference in quali look even worse.', ""1. Track conditions and characteristics can play to drivers' strengths differently so in the end I really don't think saying x driver smokes y driver on a good day/is more talented etc. means anything\n2. Your gap of 1-2.5 tenths is quite arbitrary. Thinking this range of gaps is common is based on a surface level observation. Could be true, but the severity of the gaps are not consistent. 3 tenths in Monza is usually thought to be quite bad compared to on other tracks.\n\n>I just thought it was interesting how many times Charles and Carlos were neck and neck in qualifying and also how many times Carlos wasn’t really close at all\n\nThat said, this is what I feel happened in 2021, Sainz's first season and 2022, when Sainz struggled in the first part of the season."", ""> Of course I am just manually looking, so there’s no adjustment for track length or anything.\n\n> But he’s never out qualified Carlos within the range of 1 tenth to 2.25. If you found the average of the usual gap Charles out-qualifies Carlos by it’s probably somewhere between this 2 numbers, but yet he’s never actually been in those numbers.\n\n\n\nIf you convert it to a % then you will adjust to track length.\n\nIt's possible that Carlos is within that gap, but track length just doesn't show it as a discrete number.""]",51,22,2024-10-14 11:20:00, Discussion,1,0
