1g87bbt,What’s with the overtaking rules? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g87bbt/whats_with_the_overtaking_rules/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g87bbt/whats_with_the_overtaking_rules/,2024-10-20,0 days,"So after Russell’s penalty this got me thinking - in any other type of motorsport that’s a penalty - he did force him off the track and to be honest I agree with it.

*But* that penalty was inconsistent to what we’ve seen recently - most notably t1 with Norris and Verstappen. So, for the purpose of this post let’s ignore Russel’s penalty as that’s another whole discussion.  

If the rules for the most part are that you can get away with that then why is that the case?
You can just go into a corner and escort your opponent wide? What’s with that? - we will never see any interesting racing.

Especially when the driver that’s been pushed off can’t even fight back because they’ll get a penalty for “keeping the position by going off track” when they had nowhere else to go. 

If it were up to me you’d have to leave a cars width to the car on the outside, when overtaking and defending, as is the rules in most other respects of motorsport afaik. 

Am I alone in thinking this?

The problem lies elsewhere."", 'No rules, just vibes', ""i fully believe forcing another driver off the track should be a penalty 100% of the time - the problem is it's only a penalty like 30% of the time, so it's just random who gets punished and who doesn't\n\nreally hope this comes up in the driver meeting next week because this is just getting silly"", 'The show where the rules are made up and the points do matter', 'You will go insane before you manage to find any kind of consistency from the stewards', 'Aged like wine', 'T1 incident deserved a penalty regardless of stewarding being more lenient on lap 1.

](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/doc_2_-_2022_imola_event_-_fia_f1_driving_standard_guidelines.pdf)

Apparently there is a more recent version but not publicly available. Key point is 


Guidelines for overtaking on the outside of a corner:


- In order for a car being overtaken to be required to give sufficient room to an overtaking car, the
overtaking car needs to have a significant portion of the car alongside the car being overtaken and
the overtaking manoeuvre must be done in a safe and controlled manner, while enabling the car to
clearly remain within the limits of the track.

- When considering what is a ‘significant portion’, for an overtaking on the outside of a corner, among
the various factors that will be looked at by the stewards when exercising their discretion, the
stewards will consider if the overtaking car is ahead of the other car from the apex of the corner.

- The car being overtaken must be capable of making the corner while remaining within the limits of
the track.


So Lando wasn't ahead at the apex hence wasn't entitled to room. However, the last point says that Max must be capable of making the corner as well. So IMO they are both in the wrong (or call it a racing incident). Thoughts?

EDIT: obviously these are 'guidelines' only but you would hope stewards would attempt to follow them for consistency","['The ""among the various factors the stewards will consider"" part is clear as fucking mud.\n\nI mean obviously they don\'t think being ahead at the apex is the only factor, or they\'d just say that, but instead they seem to be calling that out as the main factor but not the only one. As a result I can see why Lando\'s so pissed, if the only thing that matters is being ahead at the apex, just say that.', ""Both did something wrong (leaving the track).\n\nI assume the stewards saw wrongdoing from both Verstappen and Norris because both were too fast for the corner, kind of offsetting each other.\n\nThat doesn't mean Norris is allowed to overtake off track though."", 'It would have been a racing incident if Lando had not gained a position. He did, and therefore, penalty.', "">So IMO they are both in the wrong (or call it a racing incident).\n\nYou are correct, they're both in the wrong for leaving the track, so it offsets, racing incident. \n\nWhile off track, Lando then passed Max, causing the penalty."", 'As an aside it was always stupid to tie the rules to the apex, should be the start of the braking zone', 'Agreed. Either both penalties or , what it should be classed as, good hard racing.', 'Broken link', 'Both wrong, but one more wrong basically (by way of how far off the track he went) + Being behind at the Apex + Gaining a lasting advantage at the end of it all. \n\n  \nThats 3 reasons all of which in my opinion make it an easy Slam Dunk penalty.', ""Just want to say that from 1 January 2025, the Driving Standards Guideline will be codified into Appendix L of the International Sporting Code and will be applicable to all circuit racing which follows the Code.\n\n[This has come about from the FIA Drivers' Committee in partnership with the FIA’s Circuit Commission and Safety Department.](https://www.fia.com/news/fia-drivers-committee-delivers-driving-standards-guidelines-circuit-racing-championships)\n\nSo in future we will have a consistent reference point to shout about.""]",39,68,2024-10-21 08:31:38, Discussion,5,0

As for overtaking on the outside of a corner, the guidelines acknowledge that it is a more difficult move to pull off.

For a long time drivers have been taught from karting all the way through the racing pyramid that if you try to hang it round the outside, you are at risk of running out of road.

It’s often been left up to how hard certain drivers race. ‘Fairer’ drivers will leave a bit of room for their rivals, more ruthless drivers will edge them out.

But in recent years there has been a clear effort to define when it’s essential for a driver to leave space, and that’s the case in the new guidelines as well.

So, for a driver to be given room when overtaking on the outside, including at the exit of the corner, the overtaking car must:

-Have the front axle AT LEAST ALONGSIDE the front axle of the other car at the apex of the corner AND to the exit
-Be driven in a safe and controlled manner throughout the manoeuvre (entry, apex and exit)
-Be able to make the corner within the track limits

In a lot of cases this is going to leave a driver at the mercy of their rival or the laws of physics as cars on the inside wash out.

This isn’t intended to stop an optimistic pass, it just means drivers have to accept the risks involved. It is quite close to being a codified ‘live by the sword, die by the sword’ rule. ","['>\t— Be driven in a safe and controlled manner throughout the manoeuvre (entry, apex and exit)\n\n>\t— Be able to make the corner within the track limits\n\nabout that….', 'I feel like ahead at the apex loses all meaning when Max is only ahead at the apex because he has no intention of keeping the car on track.', 'Sorry for the odd formatting… doing from my phone!', 'Is Lando even considered the overtaker, if he is ahead prior to the braking zones?', 'But those rules apply to the overtaker, not the defender. It seems like the responsibility falls entirely on the attacker, which we may or may not agree with, but that appears to be the current interpretation.', ""It does actually, part of the same rule that applies to overtaking this way also states that the driver being overtaken must also stay within track limits, it's posted with a link in another secondary comment here"", ""Don't bother presenting common sense to jobsworths."", 'Braking zone, per this reading, doesn’t matter at all. It’s Apex only.', 'As long as the move is not done, you are still the overtaker duhhhhh.']",15,21,2024-10-21 08:31:39, Technical,4,0

Norris penalty was justified, but Verstappen should also get 5s.', 'SLAMS']",0,76,2024-10-21 08:31:41, News,0,1

This community is insane sometimes', ""Tsunoda won't lose his seat at RB (although I can't see him getting the Red Bull seat either). You would think if Red Bull finish P3 in the constructors then Perez would be a goner, but with their decisions around Checo so far, honestly who knows"", ""Nah I'm sure Tsunoda will still be at VCARB in 2025 to keep Honda happy before they move on fully to Aston Martin. After 2025 though, all bets are off for him imo. If Red Bull need him around, he'll stay there. If they think they have a better alternative, he's in danger."", 'Id see Lawson getting the seat. He looks very promising.', 'Yuki is staying for 2025, but expect him out for 2026 when Honda leaves. Perez, however, is most likely out if Lawson keeps performing.', ""Why would Yuki lose his seat? He was completely fucked over by strategy this race, just as he was even in races in 2023 vs Lawson. Exactly the situation of Daniel at Hungary, qualified better, starting in points, early pit, released into traffic, no tyre advantage to others around. At least they didn't pit him on Lap 7, so I guess that's some learning. \n\nHe also has a contract, and Honda's support."", 'Nah i would say Tsunoda is safe, but Lawson certainly left a great first impression and is gonna pressure for the Perez seat', 'From my perspective, zero chance that Colapinto moves to RB. First, Williams wants to keep him around. JV was the one who sort of cherry picked Colapinto after seeing him in ELMS a few years ago. I would say James is invested on keeping him around because he clearly thinks he has potential. Second, RB will go for their juniors and Yuki is not going anywhere because of Honda. So Hadjar and Yuki if Liam is upgraded. I also think it’s very unlikely they’ll get rid of checo. New regulations in 2026 so 2025 will be a bit of a mix. They will keep him around one more year and upgrade someone junior to RBR in ‘26.']",0,41,2024-10-21 08:31:41, Discussion,0,2

1g89hcn,Why does forcing another driver off the track makes a difference if you are attacker or defender?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g89hcn/why_does_forcing_another_driver_off_the_track/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g89hcn/why_does_forcing_another_driver_off_the_track/,2024-10-20,0 days,"How does this makes any sense in the context of Yuki, George and I think it was Piere getting all a 5 second penalty for forcing a driver off the track and Max not getting a penalty even though he did the exact same but was a defender instead of attacker?

All the talk about stewarding decisions taking the action and not the consequences into consideration is again bullshit as its not happening.

Why do not give Max a 5 sec penalty?. Would be just fair and consistend as Max was definitely in the wrong doing the same stuff as 3 other drivers that got a penalty.

/Edit: And also to make it clear i do not argue gor Lando not getting a Penalty that was correct also as he still gained an advantage bei going this far off. But the same time Verstappen got an advantage by forcing another driver off.","[""The rules essentially say that you can't force a driver off the track to overtake, and you can't go off the track to overtake.\n\nThe majority of the responsibility is on the attacking driver."", 'It doesn’t. The rule is you need to overtake cleanly or give the position back.', 'Attacking party has to get by cleanly. If he forced the defending party off the track, it wasnt clean.   \nDefending party has the right of line if equal at the apex line. So they can run the car wide and take the line and attacking party has to back off. \n\nIt all comes down to when they enter the corner and who is ahead. Because if attacker is far enough ahead on the outside, they have the right of line and defending has to leave a car wide space on exit.', ""If you're not ahead at the apex, you are not entitled to space, and the inside car can push you off the track legally."", 'So I think the rule is, don’t brake, overshoot corner, force the other driver off, profit? I think.', 'Difference is Russel finished the overtake before the corner. Norris did the overtake already outside the track.', 'T12 was completely mismanaged by the stewards for the entire race. Dive in, miss corner, keep position. wtf', ""I think if Lando hadn't overtaken him off the track, maybe Max would've gotten the penalty. The apex rule is ambiguous and easily exploited, but overtaking off the track is pretty clearcut. Had he let Max go there, he could've argued that he couldn't overtake because he was pushed off. Besides that, he would've had the pace to get him after that, so maybe that was the smarter move anyway. Lando and Mclaren need to be smarter in my opinion. Austria was another example where Lando should've been more patient, because he had the pace to get him eventually."", 'Because the rule is stupid and they should have changed it years ago']",0,202,2024-10-21 08:31:43, Discussion,0,3
