It's interesting. He's pretty detail-oriented. Sometimes you have to help him a little bit to understand what he's feeling and put it into words, but I think he's not too different from Alex (Albon). He's understanding very well and being very sensitive to the car itself, which is very helpful, and even in the simulator, which is very different to the race car, he's always quite detailed and can give us good direction and understand what the limitations are.”\n\n“He loves to talk. You probably see him in interviews. I've been pushing him to try to be concise in his comments. And it's funny, sometimes he gets carried away. I think that's the Latin philosophy, the way you live. You just express yourself a lot. It's very different from what you see in countries like England, where people are more straight to the point. It's very interesting,” he said.\n\nThe French engineer recalled what happened when he first worked with Colapinto in the simulator that the Williams team has at its Grove factory.\n\n“It's something we worked a lot at the beginning, in the simulator sessions. The first time he made a start and stopped, I think I ran out of space to write down his comments. He's more concise (now), he can still work on it,” he said with a chuckle.\n\nJego explained why it is important for Colapinto, or for that matter any Formula 1 driver, to be precise when describing what he feels with the single-seater upon returning to the garage.\n\n“When you do short starts, even in practice, the moments (to talk) are never really long. Maybe you have 90 seconds, two minutes with the driver for a quick chat. Then it needs to be really effective. And I think he's fine with that now.”\n\n“I think it's a good exercise, because if you're able to give feedback that's concise, that means it's also clear in your head. It's getting better, it's getting better. With you (the media), I don't know, maybe the heart speaks more than the head,” he finished.\n\n\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)"", 'Love how the ""talk less"" is nothing to do with his interviews or anything media related.\n\nYet most of the comments are exactly that 😂', ""Did the writer purposefully word the title to be a bit 'clickbaity?

Now that the dust has settled in Austin, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will be deleted. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","[""It cannot be stressed enough how poorly Checo is doing. George Russell started from the pitlane, had a 5 second penalty, and still finished in front of him. How is this possible? Where is it all going wrong for him? \n\nThe F1 community memed that Red Bull would lose the constructor's championship when they refused to drop him over the Summer Break, and now it looks even more likely they're going to slip to THIRD because of him. \n\nAlso, Liam Lawson from the back of the field to points. Good overtakes, great pace, VCARB finally doing something right for one of their drivers. I can't imagine the kind of pressure Lawson would've been under after getting a little chewed out by Fernando Alonso, and then dude comes right back and does some great overtaking and gets two points. You love to see it."", 'Most people here probably don’t care since it is Alpine, but I feel bad for Gasly’s race. He qualified top of the midfield and ahead of Perez, plus with both Mercs starting near the end was able to start P6. And Gasly was able to hold onto that P6 throughout the first stint. \n\nThen Magnussen in P7 attempted the undercut by pitting early and Gasly tried to cover it off yet somehow Alpine gave him an horribly slow 6.9 second pit stop that both Crofty and Brundle failed to notice on the broadcast. \n\nFrom there Gasly got stuck behind traffic with other medium runners going much longer and his race was pretty much over by that point. He was up in 10th in the final laps but Lawson and Colapinto both got past on the alternative strategy with fresh mediums against his old hards. \n\nAll in all it was a poor race for Alpine with Ocon being spun around Albon at the start of the race too. At least Alpine were wise enough to tell Ocon to steal the fastest lap away from Colapinto before the end of the race to reduce Williams’ lead over Alpine to 4 points for 8th in the constructor’s. But it feels like the Williams has looked faster than Alpine in the last few rounds so it is hard to see Alpine overcoming that deficit with only five rounds left.', 'Checo went under the radar this weekend. At one point he was behind Colapinto and I assumed he hadn’t pitted yet. Then Crofty said that Perez had pitted 10 laps ago. It took him forever to get past a Williams and he had newer tyres. He’s in a Red Bull. Russell started in the pit lane, finished ahead *and* he had a 5s penalty in all of that as well. I think there was also a point where the commentators said that Perez was going to end up catching the McLarens. I don’t know what pace that was based on but I’m pretty sure he had just gotten past Colapinto at that stage. It’s inexplicable how he continues to put in these kinds of performances and then you get Horner saying that they need Checo to perform because the Ferrari and McLarens are hunting in packs. And it’s like…what were you honestly expecting, it’s not like he was performing well at the time of the contract renewal is it.', 'What was up with Sainz’s Ferrari smelling of fuel? The pit wall told him a mode to go to and that was the last I heard of it.', ""Does anyone have a list of all the errors McLaren made in 2024? Trying to see how many points they hypothetically would've won had they been on their game."", 'Ferrari scored 55 points out of the available 59 points in the weekend. Amazing \n\nYuki crumbled under pressure again with the spin and his reaction to Lawson coming in front of him is all people need to know why he should not be promoted to RBR', ""Great performance from Lawson for a first GP in a while. Had solid race pace on hards, would have been nice if he wasn't carrying 60 place penalty and could've had a chance to send it in Q2.\xa0 I get the impression that Yuki can get a bit flustered by having a junior teammate outperform him.\xa0\n\n\nA little disappointed that McLaren made the call to encourage Lando to not give the position back. It looked for all money to be an off track overtake and with not giving it back, it meant we don't get a steward ruling on Max's off track defending.\xa0"", ""It's sort of weird that Ferrari were so blazingly fast in race pace. I mean yes, Leclerc got a fantastic start and in clean air he just cruised to victory, but I don't think either Red Bull or McLaren had an answer for Ferrari's pace. They were all close on the hards, but that Ferrari was unbelievably good on the mediums, watching him pull 7 tenths a lap on Max in the mediums was insane. I'm also still shocked that Max managed to finish ahead of both McLarens while being in a slower car. A good race but these cars are already almost as bad as the pre 2022 ones when it comes to racing, even in a car with a significant tire advantage, the dirty air effect seems really bad. Or maybe it's just Norris who's not good at going wheel to wheel."", 'For it being Austin, the off the track theatrics were pretty subdued this year. Where was Shaq in an oversized Cadillac driving Leclec to the podium?', ""All the talk about the max/lando time penalty makes us all forget about Lando's piss poor defense into turn 1, lap 1.""]",37,129,2024-10-22 08:29:50, Day after Debrief,5,6
1g8pn74,What do you think is realistically Franco’s future in 2025?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8pn74/what_do_you_think_is_realistically_francos_future/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8pn74/what_do_you_think_is_realistically_francos_future/,2024-10-21,0 days,"I started following F1 just this year and I see the changes and dropping of drivers who “had a contract” and I see everything as a possibility now (Franco replacing Verstappen? lol)


As a Latin American I want all drivers from here to do great and have a chance. Also meaning those who had a chance and can not make it in a top team should be dropped and make space for the ones who want a chance.

So I wonder how does contracts work? Because for example I know Oscar was driving for other team Jr program and then got into McLaren.

So we have teams with drivers who are obviously underperforming (given their pairs performance) and many young drivers (the ones who have won F2 championships on the past, for example, or Franco who looks obviously capable of running F1 and brings Williams HUGE marketing strategy that runs on its own with the crazy fan base that guy has. If he makes it to another season it will become a cult lol

So not me being an expert but basically Stroll and Checo if you ask me (I’m no expert so please correct me if I am wrong). The RB car might be shit this season in comparison to what they had before but it is still waaaaay better than the Williams who don’t even think of them as their competitors because they are supposed to be between the top three. How is Checo not making a podium or being more relevant? 

So I guess my question is, what would need to happen for him to get a 2025 contract? Could another team besides Williams just offer more and get him? Or would he be supposed to stay as Williams reserve?

I don’t know and I need someone with more knowledge to tell me what your idea is and in which cases we would get more of his post-race interviews next year. He looks so genuine and like he actually drives for fun even though is a so serious job.

Let’s please keep Franco 🥲","[""I think the most realistic thing is to take the route Lawson took. He is showing what he is capable of and should keep a close relation to Williams, maybe Albon or Sainz will get an offer for a promising 2026 team and then he'll get the spot."", ""F1 teams are a business. Winning is the biggest element but do not underestimate the money making part. RB are happy with Checo since his contract brings a lot of Mexican sponsorship money. Danny Ric sadly was way past his prime but he's a huge name and a fan favorite and it was his management team that got the Visa sponsorship (probably a reason why he was kicked out in the most shitty way VCARB probably wanted to get rid of him without the sponsors pulling out. Stroll... well his dad owns the team so while Stroll in my opinion is not the worst but his long tenure is probably a vanity project at this point.\n\nSo really for Colapinto to secure a seat he needs to prove his skill and also have a management team that secures good sponsorship for the team signing him. They would likely need to sell that Argentina has a good following for F1 and/or could bring valuable sponsorship money."", ""I think reserve driver is the most likely outcome. He'll be there at every race, help with sim work and if Albon or Sainz stutters he should get the drive or another spot for 26."", ""Franco is very unlucky because most of the obvious drivers that could lose a seat have probably done so for 2025:\n\nMagnussen, Zhou, Sargeant, Bottas (?), Ricciardo.\n\nOf the ones left, there is no one who's really on the hot seat (maybe Bottas if he keeps the Sauber seat), I can only see an opening if one of the rookies performs really poorly, or maybe Tsunoda now that Honda is leaving the RB/RBR family."", ""Still isn't gonna get sacked cause his dad built that whole team for him with the idea that he's gonna be WDC. The only way he'll leave is if he decides he's done. \n\nCheco... Idk man. They didn't sack him with how he's been performing (way worse then DR) so I think that he brings in such money or his sponsor has something on RB that they just can't sack him. \n\nRealistically his best bet is sticking around as a reserve driver or simulator driver and just hoping for another chance. \n\nI could see him waiting for Lewis and Fernando to retire. Not so that he could go to AM or Ferrari but because that would get the market moving. But maybe Hulk and Yuki leaving is gonna happen sooner than those two leaving the sport lol."", 'Grazing out in a field somewhere', 'WDC obviously', 'He’ll probably ride out ‘25 as a Williams reserve and get a seat for ‘26.\xa0There’s only one slot on the grid left to fill for next season and it’s at Sauber. They seem to be leaning towards either re-signing Bottas or giving Gabriel Bortoleto a shot.\n\nStroll and Checo are both safe because they’re pay drivers. Perez has massive financial backing from a very rich Mexican in Carlos Slim, which supposedly pays Red Bull enough to compensate for any drops in the WCC due to his poor performance. Lance’s dad literally owns the Aston Martin F1 team so that seat is his until he decides to retire, basically. Sucks, but business is business unfortunately. Nothing us commoners can do about it.\n\nAll of that out of the way, Colapinto will be at the top of any team’s shortlist for a ‘26 seat with the way he’s been driving. He’s shown strong pace immediately and seems to be very level-headed for somebody so young. I wouldn’t be surprised to see him substituting for drivers at other teams throughout ‘25 if somebody happens to get injured or simply underperforms.', 'Promote a RB driver to RBR and hire Colapinto for RB (I hope)']",28,129,2024-10-22 08:29:51, Discussion,-1,1

***LWIF1’s Reaction:***

Welp, the season that keeps on giving gifted us once again… I daresay Ferrari pulling out a 1-2 in a slow-burning psychological thriller of a race wasn’t on many folks’ radar (except for mine, given I stacked my fantasy lineup with both drivers, [and u/Derridizzle, whose poster prediction came true).](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g899sj/my_poster_prediction_came_true_i_also_did_the/)

One trend I’ve noticed about races at COTA, at least since 2021, is that they always have this subtle, slow-burning, intense edge to them—often without too much action through the middle portion of the race, but everything comes to life with great fanfare in the closing stages. Gotta love it!

***Personal highlights from Austin include:***

* Franco bossing his way up to P10
* Max’s stout defense against everything Lando threw at him
* Sainz steering away his engine issues to bring home a Ferrari 1-2
* George dancing his way from the pitlane to P6 (and ahead of Checo)
* And my fantasy drivers finishing in a spiffing P1, P2, P4, P5, and P10…

Before we move onto the rest of the week, here be the [post-Austin GP drivers and constructors standings](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8a4s0/drivers_and_constructors_standings_round_19/) as the paddock packs up and heads to Mexico.

\~\~\~

# The Drivers’ Mutterings & Musings

The battle for F1’s last available seat in 2025 drags on, and Valtteri Bottas, one of the contenders, is worried: [“I might not be here in 2025”.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g60y2d/valtteri_bottas_is_worried_i_might_not_be_here_in/)

One of Bottas’s adversaries in the battle for that lone seat is none other than the unexpected mid-season rookie who has knocked everyone’s socks off with his performances, Franco Colapinto. And James Vowles is pushing hard to get him into that coveted seat, [stating that “Colapinto should be in F1 in 2025, even if it costs us points.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g788lv/vowles_colapinto_should_be_in_f1_2025_even_if_it/) Silly season ain’t over yet, dear reader.

For a bit of driver news I’d love to see come true but likely won’t, Honda is allegedly pushing Red Bull to [give Yuki Tsunoda (what I think would be a) well-deserved test run.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7blz7/honda_pushing_red_bull_to_give_tsunoda_f1_test_run/) What more does the man need to do to have a shot?!

Not that it *really* matters at this point, but sometime last year… [Christian Horner *guaranteed* Liam Lawson a seat in 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g44633/christian_horner_guaranteed_liam_lawson_2024_f1/), which of course guaranteed implications on their existing driver lineup for both teams. The more beans that spill about the Red Bull/Toro Tauri VCARB driver rodeo, the more of a political, poorly handled mess the whole situation seems. Relatedly, [RB Team Principle Laurent Mekies certainly isn’t happy with how things went down.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7715a/we_should_have_done_a_better_job_team_principal/)

Max ‘Swear Bear’ Verstappen has stated that [he’ll continue dishing out minimal answers in the FIA press conferences](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6461f/max_verstappen_to_continue_giving_minimal_answers/) in protest of their, [as stated by George Russell, “silly”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6jpi3/russell_hopes_for_gpda_talks_with_fia_in_mexico/) swearing fiasco. [Max also dropped a hint as to how the FIA can end this war of words](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6gplg/max_verstappen_protest_to_continue_at_f1_us_gp/)—but will they listen? A man can dream…

\~\~\~

# The Teams’ Twistings & Turnings

For those of us F1 fans from roundabouts 2007, rejoice with me! For as I’m sure you saw, [McLaren blessed us with a bright’n’shiny splash of chrome in Austin,](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g4a4tc/mclarens_chrome_livery_for_the_2024_united_states/) a throwback to their much-loved chromed-out car from days gone by.

While not as personally exciting, it’d be unfair to swoon over McLaren’s holy chrome special without at least mentioning [Haas’s “screaming eagle” home race livery,](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g468ab/haas_reveals_us_grand_prix_special_livery/) or [Alpine’s Indiana Jones collaboration with Microsoft/Xbox.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g46z1p/road_to_cota_indiana_jones_and_the_great_circle/)

More hints of a messy Red Bull… [Darth Helmut Marko has admitted that the team’s structure is being rearranged](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g39u6z/helmut_marko_admits_red_bull_f1_organisation_is/) (read: the power struggle struggles on).

In a statement that should surprise nobody at all, [Mattia Binotto shared that turning Audi into F1 winners will be like climbing Mount Everest.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g3ezln/bbc_sport_mattia_binotto_says_turning_audi_into/) No shit, Sherlock! Climbing from P10 to P1 (or thereabouts) will take *years*, even with Audi’s impressive racing record, pedigree, and resource… [But perhaps the increased budget cap they’ve been granted will help.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g74dhq/audi_to_be_granted_increased_budget_cap_on/) Here’s to the journey!

***While not a team specific bit of news, all teams will be affected:***

As of next year, [the FIA are doing away with bonus point for fastest lap…](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g5vczi/f1_will_drop_the_bonus_points_for_fastest_lap/) With many coming to the conclusion that this change is in response to Danny Ric’s last lap glory run in Singapore. Hasta la vista! Relatedly, former F1 driver Pedro de la Rosa is quite pleased at the news, [buoyed with confidence and relief that his 2005 Bahrain racing lap record will stand for at least another year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6bjbk/pedro_de_la_rosa_this_gives_me_some_confidence/)

Following in the vein of the above, as the now-finalized 2026 sporting regulations come to light in drips and drabs, [the FIA has increased the requirement for fielding a young driver during free practice from once per season to twice.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g5y1hr/feeder_series_news_the_fia_has_increased_the/) Meaning, each regular driver will have to give up their seat twice per season, rather than just once. Good news for the younglings!

\~\~\~

# Technical Tidbits

In all their official officialness, [here’s the FIA’s breakdown of the upgrades each team brought to Austin—and boy, there’s a whole heap of them!](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6k8bn/teams_upgrades_for_the_2024_united_states_grand/)

***Now that some of the smoke has cleared around the accusations of Red Bull having an illegal ride height adjustment system, here’s the state of play:***

Red Bull does indeed have such a system on their car—which has been known to the FIA and other teams for three years. [According to the FIA, no violation has been found.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7by68/erikvharen_the_fia_has_stated_they_have_found_no/) However, courtesy of enough politicking and lobbying from McKaren Team Principle Zak Brown, Red Bull has [agreed on a plan with the FIA to make changes to their car with immediate effect…](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g5ylgd/thomasmaheronf1_red_bull_has_agreed_a_plan/)

And the accepted consensus around all this hubbub is that Zak has been trying to make noise and draw attention away from the fact that McLaren has had to revise *all* of their rear wing specs to remove the “mini-DRS” system they were caught using in Baku—which is illegal. Formula 1 is *so* back, baby!
