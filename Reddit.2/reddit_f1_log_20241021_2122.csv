](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/doc_2_-_2022_imola_event_-_fia_f1_driving_standard_guidelines.pdf)

Apparently there is a more recent version but not publicly available. Key point is 


Guidelines for overtaking on the outside of a corner:


- In order for a car being overtaken to be required to give sufficient room to an overtaking car, the
overtaking car needs to have a significant portion of the car alongside the car being overtaken and
the overtaking manoeuvre must be done in a safe and controlled manner, while enabling the car to
clearly remain within the limits of the track.

- When considering what is a ‚Äòsignificant portion‚Äô, for an overtaking on the outside of a corner, among
the various factors that will be looked at by the stewards when exercising their discretion, the
stewards will consider if the overtaking car is ahead of the other car from the apex of the corner.

- The car being overtaken must be capable of making the corner while remaining within the limits of
the track.


So Lando wasn't ahead at the apex hence wasn't entitled to room. However, the last point says that Max must be capable of making the corner as well. So IMO they are both in the wrong (or call it a racing incident). Thoughts?

EDIT: obviously these are 'guidelines' only but you would hope stewards would attempt to follow them for consistency","['The ""among the various factors the stewards will consider"" part is clear as fucking mud.\n\nI mean obviously they don\'t think being ahead at the apex is the only factor, or they\'d just say that, but instead they seem to be calling that out as the main factor but not the only one. As a result I can see why Lando\'s so pissed, if the only thing that matters is being ahead at the apex, just say that.', ""Both did something wrong (leaving the track).\n\nI assume the stewards saw wrongdoing from both Verstappen and Norris because both were too fast for the corner, kind of offsetting each other.\n\nThat doesn't mean Norris is allowed to overtake off track though."", 'It would have been a racing incident if Lando had not gained a position. He did, and therefore, penalty.', "">So IMO they are both in the wrong (or call it a racing incident).\n\nYou are correct, they're both in the wrong for leaving the track, so it offsets, racing incident. \n\nWhile off track, Lando then passed Max, causing the penalty."", 'Agreed. Either both penalties or , what it should be classed as, good hard racing.', ""If both drivers had been given a 5 second penalty there'd by no controversy at all. Russel got 5 seconds for going down the inside, staying on track and forcing Bottas off. By that metric, Max forced Lando off, Lando overtook off track. 5 seconds each or nothing each.\xa0"", 'Broken link', 'Both wrong, but one more wrong basically (by way of how far off the track he went) + Being behind at the Apex + Gaining a lasting advantage at the end of it all. \n\n  \nThats 3 reasons all of which in my opinion make it an easy Slam Dunk penalty.', ""Just want to say that from 1 January 2025, the Driving Standards Guideline will be codified into Appendix L of the International Sporting Code and will be applicable to all circuit racing which follows the Code.\n\n[This has come about from the FIA Drivers' Committee in partnership with the FIA‚Äôs Circuit Commission and Safety Department.](https://www.fia.com/news/fia-drivers-committee-delivers-driving-standards-guidelines-circuit-racing-championships)\n\nSo in future we will have a consistent reference point to shout about.""]",36,117,2024-10-21 21:22:03, Discussion,-3,0

As a Latin American I want all drivers from here to do great and have a chance. Also meaning those who had a chance and can not make it in a top team should be dropped and make space for the ones who want a chance.

So I wonder how does contracts work? Because for example I know Oscar was driving for other team Jr program and then got into McLaren.

So we have teams with drivers who are obviously underperforming (given their pairs performance) and many young drivers (the ones who have won F2 championships on the past, for example, or Franco who looks obviously capable of running F1 and brings Williams HUGE marketing strategy that runs on its own with the crazy fan base that guy has. If he makes it to another season it will become a cult lol

So not me being an expert but basically Stroll and Checo if you ask me (I‚Äôm no expert so please correct me if I am wrong). The RB car might be shit this season in comparison to what they had before but it is still waaaaay better than the Williams who don‚Äôt even think of them as their competitors because they are supposed to be between the top three. How is Checo not making a podium or being more relevant? 

So I guess my question is, what would need to happen for him to get a 2025 contract? Could another team besides Williams just offer more and get him? Or would he be supposed to stay as Williams reserve?

I don‚Äôt know and I need someone with more knowledge to tell me what your idea is and in which cases we would get more of his post-race interviews next year. He looks so genuine and like he actually drives for fun even though is a so serious job.

Let‚Äôs please keep Franco ü•≤","[""I think the most realistic thing is to take the route Lawson took. He is showing what he is capable of and should keep a close relation to Williams, maybe Albon or Sainz will get an offer for a promising 2026 team and then he'll get the spot."", ""F1 teams are a business. Winning is the biggest element but do not underestimate the money making part. RB are happy with Checo since his contract brings a lot of Mexican sponsorship money. Danny Ric sadly was way past his prime but he's a huge name and a fan favorite and it was his management team that got the Visa sponsorship (probably a reason why he was kicked out in the most shitty way VCARB probably wanted to get rid of him without the sponsors pulling out. Stroll... well his dad owns the team so while Stroll in my opinion is not the worst but his long tenure is probably a vanity project at this point.\n\nSo really for Colapinto to secure a seat he needs to prove his skill and also have a management team that secures good sponsorship for the team signing him. They would likely need to sell that Argentina has a good following for F1 and/or could bring valuable sponsorship money."", ""Franco is very unlucky because most of the obvious drivers that could lose a seat have probably done so for 2025:\n\nMagnussen, Zhou, Sargeant, Bottas (?), Ricciardo.\n\nOf the ones left, there is no one who's really on the hot seat (maybe Bottas if he keeps the Sauber seat), I can only see an opening if one of the rookies performs really poorly, or maybe Tsunoda now that Honda is leaving the RB/RBR family."", ""I think reserve driver is the most likely outcome. He'll be there at every race, help with sim work and if Albon or Sainz stutters he should get the drive or another spot for 26."", ""Still isn't gonna get sacked cause his dad built that whole team for him with the idea that he's gonna be WDC. The only way he'll leave is if he decides he's done. \n\nCheco... Idk man.

As for overtaking on the outside of a corner, the guidelines acknowledge that it is a more difficult move to pull off.

For a long time drivers have been taught from karting all the way through the racing pyramid that if you try to hang it round the outside, you are at risk of running out of road.

It‚Äôs often been left up to how hard certain drivers race. ‚ÄòFairer‚Äô drivers will leave a bit of room for their rivals, more ruthless drivers will edge them out.

But in recent years there has been a clear effort to define when it‚Äôs essential for a driver to leave space, and that‚Äôs the case in the new guidelines as well.

So, for a driver to be given room when overtaking on the outside, including at the exit of the corner, the overtaking car must:

-Have the front axle AT LEAST ALONGSIDE the front axle of the other car at the apex of the corner AND to the exit
-Be driven in a safe and controlled manner throughout the manoeuvre (entry, apex and exit)
-Be able to make the corner within the track limits

In a lot of cases this is going to leave a driver at the mercy of their rival or the laws of physics as cars on the inside wash out.

This isn‚Äôt intended to stop an optimistic pass, it just means drivers have to accept the risks involved. It is quite close to being a codified ‚Äòlive by the sword, die by the sword‚Äô rule. ","['>\t‚Äî Be driven in a safe and controlled manner throughout the manoeuvre (entry, apex and exit)\n\n>\t‚Äî Be able to make the corner within the track limits\n\nabout that‚Ä¶.', 'I feel like ahead at the apex loses all meaning when Max is only ahead at the apex because he has no intention of keeping the car on track.', 'Sorry for the odd formatting‚Ä¶ doing from my phone!', 'Is Lando even considered the overtaker, if he is ahead prior to the braking zones?', ""What is the source for this though?  There is so much discussion on rules but I can't find the Fia regs on driving standards anywhere apart from a small clarification from a few years ago."", 'But those rules apply to the overtaker, not the defender. It seems like the responsibility falls entirely on the attacker, which we may or may not agree with, but that appears to be the current interpretation.', ""It does actually, part of the same rule that applies to overtaking this way also states that the driver being overtaken must also stay within track limits, it's posted with a link in another secondary comment here"", ""Don't bother presenting common sense to jobsworths."", 'Braking zone, per this reading, doesn‚Äôt matter at all.

I mean yes, Leclerc got a fantastic start and in clean air he just cruised to victory, but I don't think either Red Bull or McLaren had an answer for Ferrari's pace. They were all close on the hards, but that Ferrari was unbelievably good on the mediums, watching him pull 7 tenths a lap on Max in the mediums was insane. I'm also still shocked that Max managed to finish ahead of both McLarens while being in a slower car. A good race but these cars are already almost as bad as the pre 2022 ones when it comes to racing, even in a car with a significant tire advantage, the dirty air effect seems really bad.

***LWIF1‚Äôs Reaction:***

Welp, the season that keeps on giving gifted us once again‚Ä¶ I daresay Ferrari pulling out a 1-2 in a slow-burning psychological thriller of a race wasn‚Äôt on many folks‚Äô radar (except for mine, given I stacked my fantasy lineup with both drivers, [and u/Derridizzle, whose poster prediction came true).](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g899sj/my_poster_prediction_came_true_i_also_did_the/)

One trend I‚Äôve noticed about races at COTA, at least since 2021, is that they always have this subtle, slow-burning, intense edge to them‚Äîoften without too much action through the middle portion of the race, but everything comes to life with great fanfare in the closing stages. Gotta love it!

***Personal highlights from Austin include:***

* Franco bossing his way up to P10
* Max‚Äôs stout defense against everything Lando threw at him
* Sainz steering away his engine issues to bring home a Ferrari 1-2
* George dancing his way from the pitlane to P6 (and ahead of Checo)
* And my fantasy drivers finishing in a spiffing P1, P2, P4, P5, and P10‚Ä¶

Before we move onto the rest of the week, here be the [post-Austin GP drivers and constructors standings](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8a4s0/drivers_and_constructors_standings_round_19/) as the paddock packs up and heads to Mexico.

# The Drivers‚Äô Mutterings & Musings

The battle for F1‚Äôs last available seat in 2025 drags on, and Valtteri Bottas, one of the contenders, is worried: [‚ÄúI might not be here in 2025‚Äù.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g60y2d/valtteri_bottas_is_worried_i_might_not_be_here_in/)

One of Bottas‚Äôs adversaries in the battle for that lone seat is none other than the unexpected mid-season rookie who has knocked everyone‚Äôs socks off with his performances, Franco Colapinto. And James Vowles is pushing hard to get him into that coveted seat, [stating that ‚ÄúColapinto should be in F1 in 2025, even if it costs us points.‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g788lv/vowles_colapinto_should_be_in_f1_2025_even_if_it/) Silly season ain‚Äôt over yet, dear reader.

For a bit of driver news I‚Äôd love to see come true but likely won‚Äôt, Honda is allegedly pushing Red Bull to [give Yuki Tsunoda (what I think would be a) well-deserved test run.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7blz7/honda_pushing_red_bull_to_give_tsunoda_f1_test_run/) What more does the man need to do to have a shot?!

Not that it *really* matters at this point, but sometime last year‚Ä¶ [Christian Horner *guaranteed* Liam Lawson a seat in 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g44633/christian_horner_guaranteed_liam_lawson_2024_f1/), which of course guaranteed implications on their existing driver lineup for both teams. The more beans that spill about the Red Bull/Toro Tauri VCARB driver rodeo, the more of a political, poorly handled mess the whole situation seems. Relatedly, [RB Team Principle Laurent Mekies certainly isn‚Äôt happy with how things went down.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7715a/we_should_have_done_a_better_job_team_principal/)

Max ‚ÄòSwear Bear‚Äô Verstappen has stated that [he‚Äôll continue dishing out minimal answers in the FIA press conferences](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6461f/max_verstappen_to_continue_giving_minimal_answers/) in protest of their, [as stated by George Russell, ‚Äúsilly‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6jpi3/russell_hopes_for_gpda_talks_with_fia_in_mexico/) swearing fiasco. [Max also dropped a hint as to how the FIA can end this war of words](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6gplg/max_verstappen_protest_to_continue_at_f1_us_gp/)‚Äîbut will they listen? A man can dream‚Ä¶

\~\~\~

# The Teams‚Äô Twistings & Turnings

For those of us F1 fans from roundabouts 2007, rejoice with me! For as I‚Äôm sure you saw, [McLaren blessed us with a bright‚Äôn‚Äôshiny splash of chrome in Austin,](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g4a4tc/mclarens_chrome_livery_for_the_2024_united_states/) a throwback to their much-loved chromed-out car from days gone by.

While not as personally exciting, it‚Äôd be unfair to swoon over McLaren‚Äôs holy chrome special without at least mentioning [Haas‚Äôs ‚Äúscreaming eagle‚Äù home race livery,](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g468ab/haas_reveals_us_grand_prix_special_livery/) or [Alpine‚Äôs Indiana Jones collaboration with Microsoft/Xbox.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g46z1p/road_to_cota_indiana_jones_and_the_great_circle/)

More hints of a messy Red Bull‚Ä¶ [Darth Helmut Marko has admitted that the team‚Äôs structure is being rearranged](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g39u6z/helmut_marko_admits_red_bull_f1_organisation_is/) (read: the power struggle struggles on).

In a statement that should surprise nobody at all, [Mattia Binotto shared that turning Audi into F1 winners will be like climbing Mount Everest.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g3ezln/bbc_sport_mattia_binotto_says_turning_audi_into/) No shit, Sherlock! Climbing from P10 to P1 (or thereabouts) will take *years*, even with Audi‚Äôs impressive racing record, pedigree, and resource‚Ä¶ [But perhaps the increased budget cap they‚Äôve been granted will help.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g74dhq/audi_to_be_granted_increased_budget_cap_on/) Here‚Äôs to the journey!

***While not a team specific bit of news, all teams will be affected:***

As of next year, [the FIA are doing away with bonus point for fastest lap‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g5vczi/f1_will_drop_the_bonus_points_for_fastest_lap/) With many coming to the conclusion that this change is in response to Danny Ric‚Äôs last lap glory run in Singapore. Hasta la vista! Relatedly, former F1 driver Pedro de la Rosa is quite pleased at the news, [buoyed with confidence and relief that his 2005 Bahrain racing lap record will stand for at least another year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6bjbk/pedro_de_la_rosa_this_gives_me_some_confidence/)

Following in the vein of the above, as the now-finalized 2026 sporting regulations come to light in drips and drabs, [the FIA has increased the requirement for fielding a young driver during free practice from once per season to twice.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g5y1hr/feeder_series_news_the_fia_has_increased_the/) Meaning, each regular driver will have to give up their seat twice per season, rather than just once. Good news for the younglings!

# Technical Tidbits

In all their official officialness, [here‚Äôs the FIA‚Äôs breakdown of the upgrades each team brought to Austin‚Äîand boy, there‚Äôs a whole heap of them!](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6k8bn/teams_upgrades_for_the_2024_united_states_grand/)

***Now that some of the smoke has cleared around the accusations of Red Bull having an illegal ride height adjustment system, here‚Äôs the state of play:***

Red Bull does indeed have such a system on their car‚Äîwhich has been known to the FIA and other teams for three years. [According to the FIA, no violation has been found.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7by68/erikvharen_the_fia_has_stated_they_have_found_no/) However, courtesy of enough politicking and lobbying from McKaren Team Principle Zak Brown, Red Bull has [agreed on a plan with the FIA to make changes to their car with immediate effect‚Ä¶](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g5ylgd/thomasmaheronf1_red_bull_has_agreed_a_plan/)

And the accepted consensus around all this hubbub is that Zak has been trying to make noise and draw attention away from the fact that McLaren has had to revise *all* of their rear wing specs to remove the ‚Äúmini-DRS‚Äù system they were caught using in Baku‚Äîwhich is illegal. Formula 1 is *so* back, baby!¬†

All the talk about stewarding decisions taking the action and not the consequences into consideration is again bullshit as its not happening.

Why do not give Max a 5 sec penalty?. Would be just fair and consistend as Max was definitely in the wrong doing the same stuff as 3 other drivers that got a penalty.
