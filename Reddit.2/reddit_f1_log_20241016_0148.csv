I'm not saying that's necessarily *the* characteristic of the great drivers, just that some have it and others don't.

Of the recent ones, I would say Schumacher, Alonso and arguably Verstappen have this attitude. They don't do this all the time, but when necessary they do it, and seem reasonably OK with the choice. 

Hamilton, Rosberg and Vettel are capable of this, and have crashed into other people deliberately (or deliberately effected a crash, if you like), but I get the sense that these were out of frustration or anger; they were never in ""control"" of the situation.

My question is: who was the last British champion driver who had that kind of ruthlessness about him? 

I don't think Button had it, nor Hill (despite that threat during Spa '98). Maybe Mansell, but I'm slightly too young to have watched him live, and my abiding image of him is pushing very hard during a race and having his car breakdown one way or another. 

Again, I don't think this is necessarily a desirable quality in a driver, nor does it mean a driver who has it is better or worse than others.

**EDIT** Thanks for your responses everyone. I guess a lot of you are quite sure it's Hamilton, which is fair enough. You never really know someone, but maybe his more ruthless side is masked by his off-track personality, which (to me at least) comes across as a bit softer than those of the three I mentioned at the top of the post. I'm trying to say this without stigmatizing discussion of mental health, but there have been times where he comes across as more psychologically vulnerable than the other drivers -- specifically in his last couple of years at McLaren, and in that battle with Rosberg. All drivers react to pressure at some point (remember that scene of Hakkinen crying in the bushes?) but I feel as if you could get into Hamilton's head, you could affect his performance in a way that you would not Schumacher or Verstappen. But maybe that's misguided.

From the replies there also seems to be a specific time period in Hamilton's career where this aggression is more evident. If we break it down, there's 

1. The McLaren years
2. The Rosberg Mercedes years
3. Post-Rosberg Mercedes

There's a little debate whether 1. or 2. is the more ""ruthless"" era, maybe both combined. Just my opinion again, but I generally feel most drivers are much more aggressive in their early years, and especially if they're in a more capable car. And the Rosberg-Hamilton years felt more full of snide jabs and highschool drama (awkward cool-down moments, passive-aggressive interviews etc.) to me than the madness of the Hamilton-Alonso year.","['Heres a surprise.
