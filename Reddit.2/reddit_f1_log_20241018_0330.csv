The Finn is waiting for Sauber/Audi's decision and is also preparing to not have a cockpit next year\n\n(Motorsport-Total.com) - Who will be in the Sauber cockpit in 2025? Even before this weekend's US Grand Prix in Austin (Texas), the driver question for next year is still unresolved. Even Valtteri Bottas, who is actually considered a hot candidate, seems to be increasingly preoccupied with this - and above all unsettled!\n\nValtteri Bottas is waiting for the decision from Sauber/Audi\n\n‘I had said that I hoped everything would be sorted out by Austin, but I'm still waiting for the final decisions,’ said Bottas, who apparently can't explain why he doesn't yet have a contract for next year in his pocket. ‘I think Mattia \\[Binotto, team principal\\] should answer that question rather than me.’\n\n‘It's out of my hands,’ says the Finn, who “can't do anything at the moment” except wait and see. ‘Of course, I'm trying to do my best this week and hope that lifts the mood. That's the state of things. We've been in contact every week. I know the conditions I'm getting into and I'm just waiting for the green light.’\n\nBottas: ‘There is a risk of not having a cockpit’\n\nThe Sauber driver was unable to say how long the decision would take on Thursday ahead of the US GP. ‘A month ago, we were told as soon as possible,’ recalls Bottas, who will “hopefully soon” receive an answer regarding his future in Formula 1. ‘Of course, there will also be a deadline from my side at some point.’\n\nThe big question: Who will be in the Sauber cockpit in 2025?\n\nIf the 240-time GP starter wants to look outside Formula 1 or take on another role in the premier class, he should make a decision in the coming weeks. ‘Christmas is coming soon, and there will be no vacancies anywhere,’ warns the otherwise relaxed Finn.\n\nBottas, who has been driving in Formula 1 since 2013 and has celebrated ten Grand Prix victories to date, is therefore also worried that he will no longer have a cockpit next year. ‘In the situation I'm in now, with only one free seat, there is of course a risk,’ admits the 35-year-old honestly.\n\nMoney ‘shouldn't be the problem’\n\nHowever, Bottas rules out the possibility that it could be down to him asking for too much money, for example, because ‘that shouldn't be an issue. I think the conditions we are talking about are as they should be and I think Audi should have the budget, at least that's what they say. So I don't think that should be a problem.’\n\nAfter all, he has ‘already built up a good relationship with Mattia’ and talked about both his future and the plans for 2025. ‘I've been told everything so far,’ reveals the current Sauber driver, who also knows that Sauber/Audi has other options for 2025.\n\n‘I love Formula 1 and I want to drive in Formula 1. It's obviously a bit of a strange situation, but that's the way it is,’ explains Bottas, who has “had a lot of time to think about different things over the past three weeks, but is always positive”.\n\nValtteri Bottas ‘remains positive’\n\n‘I will remain positive,’ says the Finn, who says there is not much more he can do than perform on the track and continue to work on success with the team. However, this is not easy, because ‘if you don't have the car, it's really difficult to show what you can do’.\n\n‘And the people who make decisions also tend to look at the results,’ fears the 35-year-old. ‘It's not easy to shine at the moment, but I just have to trust Mattia. I just have to trust that he knows what he's getting from me.’\n\n‘I feel and believe that I should have this cockpit and that it's the best thing for the team,’ says Bottas optimistically ahead of the Grand Prix in Austin. Criticism such as that recently levelled by Helmut Marko and Marc Surer leaves him cold. ‘I'm in a positive mood.’\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)"", 'I always thought if Red Bull really wanted to go for a non academy driver they should have held out 2021 for Bottas.

They have introduced measures to regulate the energy management of the Power Units as well as the management of the adjustable aerodynamics, which will involve the deployment of the “straight-line mode” (low drag) and the “cornering mode” (high downforce). In addition, there will be three pre-season tests of three days each for the 2026 season to account for the new power units that will be adopted.\n \n>The 2026 Financial Regulations (Section D) have built on the experience gained by the FIA, Formula 1 and the teams since the first introduction of Financial Regulations in 2021.

I pulled a few different regulatory eras and tried to look at the third year of relatively stable rules, like we have now (except 2012, when I just went for the competitive 4th season).

I looked at number of winning cars and drivers, gap between the top 3 in the WDC (percentage of leaders points P3 has) and the gap between the entire field in qualifying. (I excluded any obviously erroneous results such as vastly different weather between Q1 and Q3 or cars multiple seconds away from the pack). **All data was taken for first 16 races only to make it measurable between seasons.**

|Era/Year|# Winning Teams|#Winning Drivers|Gap Between Top 3|Gap Between 1st and last Quali|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Ground Effect - 2024|4|7|72%|2.45s|
|V6 Turbo - 2016|2|4|71%|4.68s|
|KERS - 2012|4|7|78%|6.14s|
|3l V10 - 2002|3|4|35%|4.94s|
|No Driver Aids - 1996|3|4|61%|6.57s|
|Ground Effect Ban - 1986|4|5|96%|10.56s|

This season looks to be up there on all metrics apart from gap between the top 3 in the table at this stage of the season.

But what is staggering is how tight the whole field is compared to any other era, I saw some people calling Sauber ""a joke"" in another thread and this proves just how good of a job Sauber are doing compared to backmarkers of yore. The gap between P20 and P1 in Bahrain this year would have put you 6th on the grid in 1986's opener.","[""Sauber being a joke is definitely relative. They're a joke because week after week, even though their qualifying time is less than 2 seconds. They still manage to finish 19th 20th almost every race. \n\nIn the past you had back markers that couldn't even finish 80% of races. In 2020-2022 Haas was finishing almost a minute behind 18th.

In my opinion, if the race winner gets 25 points then pole position should get around 5-10 points, the actual number could be up for debate.

I also think it should just be pole position that gets
Points for qualifying.

Thoughts?","['Likely because it would be the same ~3 cars getting the points over and over.

What if, for exemple, Verstappen (1st) and Norris (2nd) went to the final round with 8 points between then. 

Fast foward to the three last laps, and Norris is winning with the fastest lap (26 points), while Verstappen is second (17 points) and Perez third.

Up until that moment, Norris would win by one point.

Then, Red Bull call Perez in to get fresh rubber. The mexican fall off the Top 5 (hell, if there was a Safety Car during the race, he could even get out of the Top 10).

And then, on the last lap, while everybody thought that Norris won, Perez set the Fastest Lap, take away Lando's extra point and Verstappen wins the championship in a tie-breaker 'cause he had more wins.

Even if McLaren noticed it, what would they do? If Norris is within 20s of Verstappen, they wouldn't pit him. They only thing they could do, more thay praying, is to send out Piastri to block Perez.
