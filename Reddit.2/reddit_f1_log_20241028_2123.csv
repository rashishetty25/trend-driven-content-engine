Given Lando's pace at the end, the time loss against Verstappen, and any potential damage, it's not unreasonable to think Norris could have won this race with Verstappen 4th, behind the two Ferraris and Lando. If this happened, Verstappen would have dropped 13 points. Instead, he loses just 10 points to Lando. I appreciate it's not a huge difference, but it makes me wonder if it was part of his mindset going into this race.

Edit: I know we saw similar with Hamilton in 2021 as well. Should this lead to discussions about the time of penalties awarded? Should time penalties be served sooner (like the old 3 laps to serve a stop/go), should you be allowed to change tires at the same time?

Like Lando said before, Max doesn‚Äôt care where he finishes, as long as he makes it as hard as possible for Lando', ""It's arguable whether he would have caught Sainz without being held up, but it was clear that his priority was fucking Norris race at all costs and he was happy to crash as long as it was with Lando"", 'I agree; not giving back the position probably did keep Norris from having enough laps to win by the end, whilst only costing himself 1 place at most, given that Max still gets at least one of his penalties, and he probably realised he was getting at least one penalty.', ""Tbf I think Red Bull fucked up pitting Max so early whilst he was holding up Lando.

Should‚Äôve given him at least 4 (2 for each penalty) so he‚Äôd be at 8/12 and on the verge of a race ban.\n\nNot even just about Max, but the system in general is way too lenient.

No I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs clean racing.)\n\nAt the end of the day, a driver‚Äôs job is to win, not to play fair.

By now, there shouldn't be any smidgen of doubt that RB needs to part with Checo Perez.
He is not able to extract any sort of performance from the RB20.
It's getting ridiculous how big the gap has become with Max... and the rest of the field.

Realistically, I think there's only two options: either promote Lawson or Tsunoda to RB.
Tsunoda in that respect is, although talented,  bit erratic in his driving as of late.
Lawson on the other might be the best choice IMO. Of course he's not that experienced yet (so there's always the danger of a Gasly, Kvyat or Albon scenario at RB), but he drives calmly and smart.

A swap with one of them is not an option I think for Perez. That would be an embarrassment, frankly.

What do you think?","[""They can't.\nIf they keep him, Max is 100% not winning the championship.\nThey can't handle 2 competing McLarens and Ferraris with no backup driver support."", ""Maybe Checo can stay because he gets faster, or has Horner's leaked toe photo.\xa0"", 'Such a performance on a home race must be absolutely ridiculed.

This is de Zordo's first year, behind a new Principal, and he has delivered the goods with the upgrades Haas has received all year.  Komatsu is doing a great job as principal, but I wanted to shoutout de Zordo too because Komatsu can keep the team organized and all pulling in the same direction, and that's great, but without competent technical direction it's hard to imagine a team going from P10 to P6 with as few resources to work with as Haas has.

With Simone Resta, the relatively well-regarded technical chief from previous years, moving on to greener pastures at Mercedes this year, it would be easy to imagine Haas technical direction taking a step backwards this year.   De Zordo has filled that gap nicely, delivering a very clean set of upgrades that has consistently permitted his team to perform well ahead of the team's median expectations, with nearly every upgrade added to the car resulting in at least a few more points for the team as a whole.  For a team fighting from the back into the midfield, that's an impressive accomplishment.

For the team with the fewest developmental resources in Formula 1, Haas has performed way above their own heads at key times this year, and while Komatsu deserves a large share of the laurels for that, and some credit is due to the drivers as well, de Zordo and his team should not be forgotten.","['Haas and Ferrari did a great job fixing their tire wear issue over the winter.', 'Nice to meet you Andrea x', 'Really makes you wonder how hard Steiner was holding the team back.', 'Shoutout Ferrari', 'Is this a self-advertisement?', 'Remember when in testing people were saying Haas should be kicked out because they were 5 seconds off the pace?

I realize every track is different and Haas will likely not get to the points in every race for the rest off the season but their upward trend seems obvious. I do not have a deep technical understanding but a lot of people seem to view the 2025 season as an extension of 2024 when it comes to car development due to no rule changes and the maturity of the current rule set. Based on that Haas is probably in a better position for next year than they have been in at least 5 years.

Back to Ocon. On the face of it, he had a horrible season. He lost the power battle within Alpine to his arch rival, was publicly demoted to nr 2 and then announced not to be extended. It seems like he was lucky that Haas offered him a seat at all (although i personally believe he is a solid choice and deserves a seat in F1). In previous years, a change from Alpine/ Renault to Haas would have been a strong demotion, but since this year it is actually a bit of a promotion?! Haas has more than 3x the points of Alpine and the whole saga around the Alpine engine does not seem like they will calmly work to improve the car again?

Long story short: Did Ocon lose his seat to luck into a significantly better team next year? Sort of the reverse Sainz?","['Getting your hopes up for HAAS crushing it next season is a good way to get hurt.', ""Ocon was actively trying to leave Alpine. They basically announced they were not extending a driver who didn't want to extend with them in the first place. \n\nI'd say, probably, from his point of view just getting away from Alpine was a win. Haas performing better than Alpine is just a nice bonus."", 'Never completely trust Haas.', 'Not sure what to think about Ocon and Alpine. I mean alpine let him go and Monaco was probably a good excuse at that but reports were that Ocon had been shopping around even before the 2024 season started. \n\nI really would like to know what happened between Ocon and Alpine because he got a 3 year contract in 2021 and things seemingly were on the up. I think Ocon was just glad to get out of Alpine and the relationship has clearly suffered. \n\nHe even said very recently that he‚Äôs lost enjoyment for racing and is just going through the motions at this point. Alpine themselves have lost out on, in my opinion, the best midfield pairing on the grid. Gasly and Ocon are two drivers who I‚Äôd want if I was leading a team in the midfield and I‚Äôm not sure if Doohan is really a great replacement but we can only see until he‚Äôs in that car. \n\nBack to the original point, Haas are doing well and Komatsu has done a great job however we don‚Äôt know whether that will correlate to next year. They‚Äôre on a good trajectory but they also were in 2018 and then produced a car that was a tyre shredder in 2019. If Haas continue to be on a good trajectory and produce a car that starts challenging the top 4 teams then yes, Ocon is a huge winner out of all of this.', ""If Haas can keep this trajectory going then I'd say he's the winner of silly season, not just one of. It'll be the definition of failing upward.\n\nBig if though but Alpine aren't going anywhere positive either."", 'Trusting in Haas not to cock it up is quite brave', 'Three teams on the grid you must never trust even if they show form and signs of having gotten their shit together:\n\n1.

They‚Äôre taking home a lot of windtunnel time as well to develop their car. They‚Äôre also taking the Merc engine for 26, which is supposedly the best available for those reg‚Äôs.\n\nHaas is having a really good year this year. But we don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll further progress for next year, if they‚Äôll slip back, or stay the same. They‚Äôre having less windtunnel time than they‚Äôre used to next year.\n\nCould be either of them, and then it could all change again for 26. Personally I‚Äôd bet on Alpine long term out of the two. \n\nI also think there‚Äôs security in Gasly‚Äôs position (being the only french thing left in the french national team) which should help him extend if he doesn‚Äôt get other offers. Meanwhile Ocon is more vulnerable to this being his last contract by not having those kind of ties, plus Merc who he‚Äôs tied to has passed him over once again.', ""Reminder that Alpine were considerably better than Haas have been this year.\n\nMidfield teams crossover from season to season is the most volatile thing in F1.

Jokes aside, how do these meetings pan out? What kind of plans do they discuss? Maybe I'm wrong but it must be depressing to discuss different plans when the whole camp must know they will come in pretty much last place.

I think just having a car that allows you to have flexibility on strategy is something that last year we couldn't have, so we were boxed in to stop at certain laps, we couldn't extend, we had so much deg that it looked always like people could extend and then come back on us on a harder tire. Last year we were just zero flexible and we couldn't do anything with our racing so it looked like we were not getting the strategy right a lot of times. But when you have a car that is better on tyres, two drivers that can push on the car more often, and you have that extra flexibility, your strategy also looks better.

Sainz, on the other hand, has used a completely different version (and weaker in my opinion) since his first victory (Made by the APM International Orchestra https://youtu.be/w0AYozGU2cg?si=59FOk1Q-RL-0V-S3)

We don‚Äôt know if Sainz had pace in hand. \n\nBut the premise of the article remains true. Due to the points structure of F1, Lando needs wins, so Max is incentivised to stop Lando winning above all else.', 'It\'s what we said at the time as well, the worst thing for Norris\'s race was that he got stuck behind Max due to egregious divebomb by Max into T7, which not only lost him the position to Max but also let Charles through.\n\nThen Max just kept gradually falling more and more behind the Ferraris, and Lando was stuck there in the dirty air being unable to make a move (also due to inherent lack of straight line performance for Mclaren, Piastri was having trouble passing cars down the straight for a lot of the race as well).\n\nBy the time Max pitted, Lando was already almost 13 seconds off the lead, and that difference just increased over the next couple laps as well because his tyres were already dead being stuck behind Max for first 25 laps.\n\nIn fact in the second stint, Lando reduced the gap to Carlos all the way to 4.7 seconds by the end, and even hunted down and passed Charles on track. \n\nIf Lando is 2nd after Lap 10, and doesn\'t have Leclerc between him in Sainz for the rest of the race, I think it\'s quite possible he wins the race given his immense advantage during the hard stint. It wouldn\'t have been a guarantee because Sainz isn\'t the easiest to pass either, but by the end Lando was almost 5-7 tenths a lap faster than Ferraris on some laps. That coupled with DRS would have been huge.\n\nWhat should have been a 13 point swing ended up being a 10 point swing because of the Verstappen ""Tactics"".', ""I said it when it happened with KMag and I'll say it here --  two outstanding 10-second penalties should convert to an immediate drive-through penalty.  That would have largely negated Norris' disadvantage here and we would have gotten to see whether or not he had the pace to deal with Ferrari on the day."", 'I also wonder if this whole situation would not have occured if Sainz did not lock up his brakes also compacting the gap between VER and NOR', ""One thing people are not talking about is Lando pace change drastically in the second stint. The McLaren this season is like Mercedes last year. When the fuel goes down, they gain a great boost compare to the others. Even without Max dirty air, Sainz gap could've been still too great by the time Lando pace improve. Plus Ferrari would've known this and reacted with their tire strats or use Charles to undercut and mess with Lando. Could he have won? Yes. Would it be a sure thing? Absolutely not. Sainz is no slouch and this track isn't Cota when it comes to over taking. Max just made Ferrari life a whole lot easier."", ""Everyone's talking about how Norris would have won without Max's shenanigans but I doubt it. Mexico is not the easiest track to pass and that McLaren has had trouble overtaking. He had similar pace to Leclerc even late into the second stint before Leclerc encountered backmarkers."", ""Can't they just make the rule that if at the start of braking, you are halfway/significantly alongside you both have to keep room for eachother. Otherwise the guy in front has the corner so then the 'normal' rules apply. Divebomb and no matter what, if you don't leave a Carswidth, penalty. If you divebomb the outside you can get pushed off because there is no reasonable option for the defending driver to keep you in mind"", 'A whole 3.628.000 points?']",34,56,2024-10-28 21:23:19, Statistics,23,8

I've had trouble being truly invested in the storylines as a result. \n\nIt's not fully gone - LH's magical win at Silverstone, GR's last stint at Spa, Piastri's gutsy win in Baku and Canada in general are standouts, but I'm lacking more sustained excitement.\n\nIDK.

It is not a super likely outcome, but it does seem somewhat likely it will be decided on the final race, which means its likely not leaving the conversation anytime soon.  One thing that has been clear this season is that fortunes changes fast.  We have seen the top 3-4 teams swap supremacy every few races. Given that, lots of things are possible, including Red Bull getting their shit together and Max standing on every podium.  Also possible is McLaren getting their updates working and Norris winning the majority of the remaining races. \n\nAgree it is unlikely, but there is a fight and both Norris and Max know it.""]",24,34,2024-10-28 21:23:19, Discussion,-2,2

# The Mexican Grand Prix



**Qualifying:**

P1. Carlos Sainz

P2. Max Verstappen

P3. Lando Norris



**Grand Prix:**

P1. Carlos Sainz

P2. Lando Norris

P3. Charles Leclerc



***LWIF1‚Äôs Reaction:***

Good lord F1 has been spicy. Unless Red Bull pulls a purple‚Äôn‚Äôblue rabbit outta their butts and manages to unlock a sizeable pace advantage over McLaren AND Ferrari *right now*, I‚Äôd wager we‚Äôre in for ever-increasing spiciness in the closing rounds. Lando‚Äôs WDC bid looks to be losing steam, at least if you consider how the amount of points he needs to gain in each race is growing rather than shrinking. Say what you will about Max‚Äôs boundary-breaking defensive tactics, but they‚Äôre proving effective‚Äîand highlighting how cunning and calculating he is‚Ä¶ Talk about being 10/10 villain.

***Personal highlights from Mexico include:***

* The most action-packed, entertaining, dare I say *cinematic* Mexican Grand Prix in recent memory (and possibly ever?) 
* Carlos Sainz reclaiming his coveted P1 from Max with a classy overtake, then steaming off into the distance, presumably powered by chilis.  
* Contentious (and rather pissy) wheel-to-wheel action through the pack.  
* A double points finish for Haas, vaulting them into P6 in the WCC.  
* And more fuel for the driving standards fiery war of words‚Ä¶

\~\~\~

# The Drivers‚Äô Mutterings & Musings

*The hottest talking point coming out of Austin and Mexico is the latest flare-up about racing standards between drivers (courtesy of Max Verstappen‚Äôs stout defensive maneuvers against Lando Norris).*

*General consensus seems that Max has been toeing the line of how the existing rules and standards are laid out‚Äîbut that said existing rules and standards are part of the problem in not supporting hard and fair racing, while leaving a lot open to the interpretation of drivers and stewards alike.*

*Hence the outpouring of statements about* [*how Austin exposed the flaws in F1‚Äôs driving standards*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9cvfm/how_austin_exposed_the_flaws_in_f1s_driving/)*,* [*calls for a racing regulation overhaul*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9eo4u/jenson_button_calls_for_fia_rule_change_after/)*, and the current rules being* [*a blueprint to dissuade overtaking.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9eo4u/jenson_button_calls_for_fia_rule_change_after/)

*If you‚Äôd like to better understand these mysterious racing regulations,* [*this article courtesy of The Race is your best bet*](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/little-known-new-f1-rules-already-affecting-racing/)*, given the FIA chose not to make their 2024 regulations publicly available, unlike in years gone by.*

*Meanwhile, Mulletman Bottas has taken a simpler view,* [*claiming that some drivers are taking the piss outta the racing regulations‚Ä¶*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbah1i/valtteri_bottas_claims_some_drivers_taking_the_p/) *Fair enough VB!*

*Relatedly‚Ä¶ On the heels of the above, Investigative Redditor* u/stetoe [*put together this brilliant post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9dt5h/with_calls_for_new_rule_changes_after_verstappens/) *compiling all of the F1 rule changes that have occurred since 2016 as a direct result of Max doing Max things.*

*(For those fascinated and eager for a follow up, by popular demand* u/stetoe *cobbled together similar posts as above,* [*but for rules changed due to Lewis Hamilton,*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga7lqk/by_request_i_also_compiled_all_the_f1_rules/) *as well as for* [*the changes triggered by Sebastian Vettel)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbsett/surprisingly_few_all_the_f1_rules_changed_or/)*.*

***Okay, let‚Äôs move on from the driving standards rabble-babble:***

Fernando Alonso started his 400th Grand Prix in Mexico (pretty impressive for a rookie, if I may say so), [celebrating the occasion with this lovely special lid.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8s0xp/fernando_alonso_will_start_his_400th_f1_gp_in/)

In celebration of his time-bending achievement, Young Fernando appeared on F1‚Äôs Beyond The Grid podcast to discuss [why‚Äîand how‚Äîhe‚Äôs still fired up for racing in Formula 1 after 400 races](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga67mt/fernando_at_400_why_alonsos_still_fired_up/) (hint: he might be a vampire).

Thanks to his dynamite opening performances, there‚Äôs a [‚Äúcarambola (which means *lucky chance* in Argentine Spanish) for Franco Colapinto to be on the grid next year.‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8w9ma/virutasf1_there_is_a_carambola_for_franco/) In order for that to happen though, there‚Äôll have to be driver movement elsewhere on the grid‚Äîas well as sponsors who will have a say.

*Aaaaand apparently* [*Franco has an offer on the table from Red Bull:*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gckaxb/sky_italia_f1_drivers_market_future_of_colapinto/) For which team and seat we know not. The hang-up, of course, is that Williams would have to release or loan Franco to a team they‚Äôve got eyes on competing with soon‚Ä¶ But JV did say the other week that he wants Franco on the grid, regardless if that means Williams loses points as a result. So who knows!

Pundit Lawrence Barretto claims that [‚ÄúValtteri Bottas is in good shape to retain his Sauberaudi seat, but F2 championship leader Gabriel Bortoleto is still under consideration‚Äù.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gahgbl/lawrence_barretto_i_understand_valtteri_bottas_is/) I say give me another rookie or give me death!

However, returning for another with Sauberaudi isn‚Äôt Valtteri‚Äôs only option, apparently. [Lawrence also reports that Bottas is in talks with Mercedes to return in a non-racing role as a back up](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbamaw/lawrence_barretto_valtteri_bottas_says_his/) (meaning reserve, I presume).¬†

And given we‚Äôre on the Americas leg of the season, the annual [‚ÄúSergio Perez is in trouble and perhaps on his last legs‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gauy46/contract_warning_for_sergio_perez_after_lawson/) rumours are bubbling up from the underworld. I‚Äôll report on them due to his woeful trend of underperformance, but definitely, absolutely, certainly take them a spoonful of salt or two.

*However, his dearth of performance in Mexico won‚Äôt help matters.*

For another rumbling to take with a spoonful of salt (sadly), at Honda‚Äôs ~~incessant pressuring~~ behest, [Yuki Tsunoda seems to be *finally* getting a Red Bull test in Abu Dhabi this year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb956m/lawrence_barretto_yuki_tsunoda_says_theres_a_good/) Much as I‚Äôd love to see him have a season in the car, I think we all know this won‚Äôt go anywhere though :(

# The Teams‚Äô Twistings & Turnings

Max - 8 poles - 7 wins - 3 losses from pole - 2 wins without pole.

Charles - 3 poles - 3 wins - 2 losses from pole - 2 wins without pole.

Lando - 6 poles - 3 wins - 4 losses from pole - 1 win without pole.

Lewis - 0 poles - 2 wins - 0 losses from pole - 2 wins without pole.


This is common knowledge but still wanted to highlight. 
Lando stands out. 4 losses after starting in pole in a good enough mclaren.
Either lando is super good in quali or just loses the temperament in the race. There are other factors at times with luck. But max is ruthless when he is ahead. Even charles is there or thereabouts.

In general, very hard to win wdc with this conversation. Basically just depends on others falling back.

The gap between the Red Bull and everyone else was larger than whatever gap McLaren (or Ferrari) have had when they've objectively been the quickest.\n\nPeople compare this season to 2009 for good reason. If Max holds on, it's because of the opening races being dominant whilst the rest of the season saw multiple teams squabbling over wins.\n\nFerraris update after the summer break has been Red Bulls biggest friend so far. Without it, Lando is probably 20-25 points behind Max currently. But it also means that if McLaren can get ahead of Ferrari, it's a horrendous scenario for Red Bull as you're potentially looking at 5th place.\n\nLando has not been anywhere near good enough at converting his poles though.

But comparing the different points of the season as equal is misleading."", 'Hes good but its hard to say since he never had an actual strong qualifying teammate like max or leclerc, or even russell', 'Are you genuine calling him super good right after seeing this Mexico GP?

In 2023 Piastri was fairly close in qualifying but his tyre management in races was missing (which is not a surprise for a rookie). In 2024 Oscar has not quite closed the gap in qualies but his racecraft has been impressive several times.

I believe the general consensus amongst F1 fans in general is that Norris has more pace while Piastri has a better composure. What do you think is more important then ? Is it speed or mentality ? Also who is more likely to turn things around... is it Lando improving his mentality and his starts or is it Oscar becoming quicker (especially over one lap) ?","['Ask me after the next season, if Piastri is still not matching Norris by the end of that then Norris is better with the higher ceiling.', 'Not in my opinion. \n\nHe‚Äôs not showing Lando‚Äôs one lap pace.

People point to this being Oscar‚Äôs second season but he‚Äôs had 42 races now.

He had a run of like 8 top 5 finishes in a row in that car.\n\nI don‚Äôt think Oscar has shown that he has the one lap pace of Lando and thats usually something that comes pretty quick, for example we saw Lando outqualify Sainz in his first 2 seasons, and Leclerc outqualify Vettel in his 2nd season. In comparison Oscar is losing 16-4 H2H so far this season.\n\nOscar is still improving but people still don‚Äôt like to admit how good Lando is (who is still improving himself), which sometimes makes Oscar look worse than he is.

I don't think many would describe Michael or Senna as calm. Sure it could be a good thing, but to act like it's a sign of a great driver is a bit crazy to me."", 'I find it insane how people often talk about how ""Oscar has improved rapidly"" when he has basically the same average pace gap to Lando now as he did in like the last 1/3rd of 2023', 'What I‚Äôm noticing in this thread is how people tend to gloss over Lando‚Äôs race pace and tyre management. Everyone acknowledges his qualifying pace and how quick he is over one lap but he gets much less recognition for how he‚Äôs able to zoom off into the distance as soon as he gets into clean air and gets more out of his tyres than basically anyone else. His race pace and tyre management is some of the best on the grid. Oscar is quite a bit off matching him in those areas too.', ""I want people to remember, Norris has never lost a qualifying battle in his career so far as an F1 driver.\n\nOnly other guy on the grid who can say that is Leclerc. \n\nOn top of Lando's excellent qualifying pace (31-11 against Piastri in last 2 seasons in Saturday Qualifying), he's also one of the absolute best at tyre management and banging in consistently excellent laptimes throughout a stint. \n\nLando's weaknesses currently is aggression in wheel to wheel battles and race starts (much improved compared to midseason especially, Baku, Singapore, COTA Sprint, Mexico all were good starts, only bad one was COTA main race, and even that like almost noone in last few years has held the lead into T1, even Verstappen and Leclerc lost the lead in 2021 and 2023 respectively).\n\nAnd as you can see in Mexico, he was much more decisive with Verstappen in the T4 maneuver compared to COTA, which shows his learning process and how he's getting better race by race.\n\nI think Piastri is extremely good, he's still only in his 2nd season and some of these tracks are still new to him. But the talent and potential is undeniable.\n\nI wouldn't say he has a higher ceiling until he starts to show that level consistently. Atleast string together 4-5 races where you constantly outqualify and out race Norris. Even in the races in the middle of the season when he beat Norris like Hungary, Spa, Monza, Etc. he relied on Norris's bad starts to get ahead and then just Norris couldn't get past due to the exact same pace in both cars."", ""Can't say without visiting their homes with a tape measure""]",0,94,2024-10-28 21:23:24, Discussion,0,21

A DNF of both cars helps him because Lando gains nothing on him in the championship, penalties don\'t matter because he still gets to hold up Lando behind him for the entire first stint and take him 15 seconds off the lead as well, and ultimately Lando only gains 10 points on Max rather than possibly 13 if he let Lando through and Lando won.\n\nIt\'s all worth it in the end.', 'Lewis Hamilton said he didn‚Äôt see the incident between Max and Lando apart from ‚Äúa group of cars‚Äù and ‚Äúa plume of smoke, like dust and I knew it must have been [Verstappen].‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúLike, for sure it was him.‚Äù\n\nHahahahahahahahaha', 'Can Mercedes sort out their car I want Lewis battling at the front whilst this is going on, Hungary was fun to watch üòÜ', 'People are slowly coming round to Lewis being right in 2021 but they didn‚Äôt want to admit it because they wanted him to lose. \n\nThis is the consequences of that, and this is what everyone wanted.', 'Crazy how the FIA let these things slide in 2021 and now its bitten them in the ass.

And now, with the Mexico GP done and dusted, once again, nothing happens, and Perez is still here. How is this even news anymore?

It‚Äôs lazy journalism, plain and simple, it's dishonest, it's boring and it's repetitive. Instead of focusing on actual developments or meaningful stories within the sport, we get flooded with these BS articles that add absolutely nothing new to the conversation but rile up people needlessly. It‚Äôs beyond frustrating as an F1 fan to see these headlines clogging up my feed week after week. Can we please, for the love of motorsport, stop giving attention to this recycled nonsense and demand something with substance?
