1g4l9tw,How to invite former F1 drivers/people to podcast?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g4l9tw/how_to_invite_former_f1_driverspeople_to_podcast/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g4l9tw/how_to_invite_former_f1_driverspeople_to_podcast/,2024-10-15,0 days,"Hello, I'm Micha≈Ç, sport journalist from Poland. I have been involved in sports journalism for years - mainly volleyball, basketball and F1. Over the years of working for various websites, I managed to arrange interviews with many F1 drivers - among others Mario Andretti, Jody Scheckter, Thierry Boutsen, Derek Warwick, Robert Kubica, Nick Fry, Sebastien Buemi, Mario Theissen, Mika Salo. I think that over the years there have been 20+ people related to F1. All of them were published in text form on Polish websites. I suspect that the desire to talk was due to the reach of the sites I worked for, and not because of me personally.



For over a year now, I have been running my podcast (a modest project, 32 podcast episodes so far), in which I have not yet had a guest from F1. Most of them are volleyball and basketball. However, I would like to talk to someone from F1. While I know that it is very difficult to get in touch with people from the current F1 environment, theoretically it should be easier with former drivers, bosses, directors, etc. It should be, but it isn't, because unfortunately I am either ignored or rejected due to my small reach. In many cases I cannot find a contact (I often used IG, FB or websites of drivers or their companies to contact me).



Can anyone advise me on how I can get more F1 contacts or encourage F1 people to join my podcast? Sending links to previous interviews doesn't seem to work. Thanks in advance for your help. Greetings from Poland.","[""PR people are your best bet. but as youve pointed out the reach of the sites that you've worked for is probably more of a factor rather than yourself as a journalist, sorry to be blunt. regretably its a numbers game, current drivers only have so much time in a day and they'll prioritise the outlets that will give them the most reach for publicity \n\ni think youre better off trying to find someone whos not a driver currently, or someone who works/worked in f1 not as a driver. cold calling is probably the way to go if you dont have contacts already. keep talking to as many as you can, get as many people on there as possible, build interest and reach. the people you interview could eventually be a new contact to someone else, who knows. \n\nrandom names i can think of:\n\n- gunther steiner (dude is promoting his book now iirc)\n\n- hanz harald franzer (his kid makes tiktok videos featuring him) - probably butchered his name sorry \n\n- former/current mechanics, other team folk, i dunno maybe a chef... people who dont usually get interviewed and can afford to make time for you. i feel like this is your best bet tbh\n\n- other journalists, you could pitch it as an episode of two journalists talking to each other about your experiences in your respective sport (ie: your experience talking to people in volleyball/basketball)\n\n- i think some photographers might give it a go. jamey price + kym illman are very active on social media. \n\nall the bestttt"", 'I am connected through LinkedIn to several motorsports people. \n\nAre your podcasts in Polish or English?', ""What's your budget?"", ""Most relevant F1 people aren't going to want to talk to a podcast unless you:\n\nA. Offer money\n\nB. Offer them a chance to promote something to a large enough audience.\n\nI'd wager you can't really offer either at the moment so I'd start low and try to find unique and lesser known guests involved with the sport (maybe some mechanics, or drivers who raced against guys like Max and Charles in the junior categories) and then work your way up. If you can't offer something tangible then you need to focus on people who aren't well known and who would be open for a chat because they aren't asked to do it very often.\n\nAs for contacting them I'd start sending out messages on twitter or linkedin and see if you get any replies. You can have a generic template and then personalise it a bit for each person to not make it look like a robot. If you send out enough I'm sure that at least a couple of people will respond and be down to give an hour or two of their time at some point and then from there you can start growing the audience, growing the contacts etc. and take steps to get where you want it to be."", 'No comments üò≠üôè', 'Lol üòÜ ü§£']",0,7,2024-10-16 13:29:47, Discussion,0,0
