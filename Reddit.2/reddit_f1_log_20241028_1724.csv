Given Lando's pace at the end, the time loss against Verstappen, and any potential damage, it's not unreasonable to think Norris could have won this race with Verstappen 4th, behind the two Ferraris and Lando. If this happened, Verstappen would have dropped 13 points. Instead, he loses just 10 points to Lando. I appreciate it's not a huge difference, but it makes me wonder if it was part of his mindset going into this race.

Edit: I know we saw similar with Hamilton in 2021 as well. Should this lead to discussions about the time of penalties awarded? Should time penalties be served sooner (like the old 3 laps to serve a stop/go), should you be allowed to change tires at the same time?

1gdmvx6,How on earth can RB retain Perez in 2025?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gdmvx6/how_on_earth_can_rb_retain_perez_in_2025/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gdmvx6/how_on_earth_can_rb_retain_perez_in_2025/,2024-10-27,0 days,"

By now, there shouldn't be any smidgen of doubt that RB needs to part with Checo Perez.
He is not able to extract any sort of performance from the RB20.
It's getting ridiculous how big the gap has become with Max... and the rest of the field.

Realistically, I think there's only two options: either promote Lawson or Tsunoda to RB.
Tsunoda in that respect is, although talented,  bit erratic in his driving as of late.
Lawson on the other might be the best choice IMO. Of course he's not that experienced yet (so there's always the danger of a Gasly, Kvyat or Albon scenario at RB), but he drives calmly and smart.

A swap with one of them is not an option I think for Perez. That would be an embarrassment, frankly.

What do you think?","[""They can't.\nIf they keep him, Max is 100% not winning the championship.\nThey can't handle 2 competing McLarens and Ferraris with no backup driver support."", 'Such a performance on a home race must be absolutely ridiculed.

If he does well enough he will drive a red bull in 2025.', ""Maybe Checo can stay because he gets faster, or has Horner's leaked toe photo.\xa0"", 'Just for the hype Danny Ric should have finished this season there is no reason to keep Perez apart from money', 'They absolutely can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs costing the teams millions, literally‚Ä¶ third in a drivers championship they could‚Äôve won is losing them a fortune\n\nAnd redbull needs to look at the future‚Ä¶ Max is very clear that he won‚Äôt stick around when he would be considered old, he‚Äôs not a fernando or a lewis‚Ä¶ Redbull needs someone to take over the team when Max leaves‚Ä¶ they can‚Äôt afford to wait till Max is gone to start looking for a new potential world champion', 'They should‚Äôve signed sainz when they had the chance', 'Too late now,, they made their bed. They could have had literally else in that car by now but I guess they think the money must be worth having a bottleneck. Like, how badly managed do you have to be to have two teams and somehow still not enough seats because one of the big ones has to go to a pay driver. Fuck that felt good, this forza ferrari thing feels great lol', 'My guess is that Perez is still there because there might be a slight possibility that Max might leave if they loose both titles. On the surface everything looks fine at Redbull but below that is probably lots of discontent with how things are going and the drama from the start of the year is also still lingering.\n\nI still see Max out if he looses the WDC either still to another team which boots one of their current drivers or taking a sabbatical or even retire with all the bullshit going on recently with the FIA etc.\n\nSo Redbull hang on to Perez as they can use the cash and they do want atleast one driver in 2025 who knows the team and the car so they can better prepare for 2026.\n\nBut lets see maybe im wrong but I still have the feeling we have not seen all from what still is awaiting Redbull ones the titles are both lost and the infighting really starts.']",294,208,2024-10-28 17:23:22, Discussion,-2,0

This is de Zordo's first year, behind a new Principal, and he has delivered the goods with the upgrades Haas has received all year.  Komatsu is doing a great job as principal, but I wanted to shoutout de Zordo too because Komatsu can keep the team organized and all pulling in the same direction, and that's great, but without competent technical direction it's hard to imagine a team going from P10 to P6 with as few resources to work with as Haas has.

With Simone Resta, the relatively well-regarded technical chief from previous years, moving on to greener pastures at Mercedes this year, it would be easy to imagine Haas technical direction taking a step backwards this year.   De Zordo has filled that gap nicely, delivering a very clean set of upgrades that has consistently permitted his team to perform well ahead of the team's median expectations, with nearly every upgrade added to the car resulting in at least a few more points for the team as a whole.  For a team fighting from the back into the midfield, that's an impressive accomplishment.

For the team with the fewest developmental resources in Formula 1, Haas has performed way above their own heads at key times this year, and while Komatsu deserves a large share of the laurels for that, and some credit is due to the drivers as well, de Zordo and his team should not be forgotten.","['Haas and Ferrari did a great job fixing their tire wear issue over the winter.', 'Nice to meet you Andrea x', 'Really makes you wonder how hard Steiner was holding the team back.', 'Shoutout Ferrari', 'Is this a self-advertisement?', 'Remember when in testing people were saying Haas should be kicked out because they were 5 seconds off the pace?

I realize every track is different and Haas will likely not get to the points in every race for the rest off the season but their upward trend seems obvious. I do not have a deep technical understanding but a lot of people seem to view the 2025 season as an extension of 2024 when it comes to car development due to no rule changes and the maturity of the current rule set. Based on that Haas is probably in a better position for next year than they have been in at least 5 years.

Back to Ocon. On the face of it, he had a horrible season. He lost the power battle within Alpine to his arch rival, was publicly demoted to nr 2 and then announced not to be extended. It seems like he was lucky that Haas offered him a seat at all (although i personally believe he is a solid choice and deserves a seat in F1). In previous years, a change from Alpine/ Renault to Haas would have been a strong demotion, but since this year it is actually a bit of a promotion?! Haas has more than 3x the points of Alpine and the whole saga around the Alpine engine does not seem like they will calmly work to improve the car again?

Long story short: Did Ocon lose his seat to luck into a significantly better team next year? Sort of the reverse Sainz?","['Getting your hopes up for HAAS crushing it next season is a good way to get hurt.', ""If Haas can keep this trajectory going then I'd say he's the winner of silly season, not just one of. It'll be the definition of failing upward.\n\nBig if though but Alpine aren't going anywhere positive either."", ""Ocon was actively trying to leave Alpine. They basically announced they were not extending a driver who didn't want to extend with them in the first place. \n\nI'd say, probably, from his point of view just getting away from Alpine was a win. Haas performing better than Alpine is just a nice bonus."", 'Never completely trust Haas.', 'Not sure what to think about Ocon and Alpine. I mean alpine let him go and Monaco was probably a good excuse at that but reports were that Ocon had been shopping around even before the 2024 season started. \n\nI really would like to know what happened between Ocon and Alpine because he got a 3 year contract in 2021 and things seemingly were on the up. I think Ocon was just glad to get out of Alpine and the relationship has clearly suffered. \n\nHe even said very recently that he‚Äôs lost enjoyment for racing and is just going through the motions at this point. Alpine themselves have lost out on, in my opinion, the best midfield pairing on the grid. Gasly and Ocon are two drivers who I‚Äôd want if I was leading a team in the midfield and I‚Äôm not sure if Doohan is really a great replacement but we can only see until he‚Äôs in that car. \n\nBack to the original point, Haas are doing well and Komatsu has done a great job however we don‚Äôt know whether that will correlate to next year. They‚Äôre on a good trajectory but they also were in 2018 and then produced a car that was a tyre shredder in 2019. If Haas continue to be on a good trajectory and produce a car that starts challenging the top 4 teams then yes, Ocon is a huge winner out of all of this.', 'Trusting in Haas not to cock it up is quite brave', 'The midfield is forever in flux.\n\nAlpine‚Äôs said their 2025 car is completely different, and the upgrades they brought at COTA are part of their 2025 development.

I think just having a car that allows you to have flexibility on strategy is something that last year we couldn't have, so we were boxed in to stop at certain laps, we couldn't extend, we had so much deg that it looked always like people could extend and then come back on us on a harder tire. Last year we were just zero flexible and we couldn't do anything with our racing so it looked like we were not getting the strategy right a lot of times. But when you have a car that is better on tyres, two drivers that can push on the car more often, and you have that extra flexibility, your strategy also looks better.

I'm curious since I'm still relatively new if this year has seen teams allow their drivers to challenge each other more or if I'm just able to notice it more.","['I wouldn‚Äôt say so. They have been battling and equal amount and it is hard to stop teammates from fighting without a valid reason', 'Depends on the attitude and the situation of the team. Some teams like Mercedes have historically allowed it, RBR have been big on team orders just as examples.\n\nThis year we have quite a few drivers leaving teams and with points to prove so they probably care a bit less about maintaining those relationships.', 'Mercedes and RBR have the same stance on team orders, which is ""allow both to fight it out until one is clearly ahead in the championship""', ""Ah yes, the championship deciding 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix.\n\nRed Bull's always been pragmatic and protected the car where there was nothing for the team to gain, but to be fair to them, they've tended to have younger hotter-headed drivers."", 'I mean, a lot of teams have a ""race until the first pitstop then prioritize the guy ahead"".

Max - 8 poles - 7 wins - 3 losses from pole - 2 wins without pole.

Charles - 3 poles - 3 wins - 2 losses from pole - 2 wins without pole.

Lando - 6 poles - 3 wins - 4 losses from pole - 1 win without pole.

George - 2 poles - 1 win - 2 losses from pole - 1 win without pole.

Oscar - 0 poles - 2 wins - 0 losses from pole - 2 wins without pole

Lewis - 0 poles - 2 wins - 0 losses from pole - 2 wins without pole.


This is common knowledge but still wanted to highlight. 
Lando stands out. 4 losses after starting in pole in a good enough mclaren.
Either lando is super good in quali or just loses the temperament in the race. There are other factors at times with luck. But max is ruthless when he is ahead. Even charles is there or thereabouts.

In general, very hard to win wdc with this conversation. Basically just depends on others falling back.

","['Lando is super good in quali. He never lost H2H with a team mate in quali.

The gap between the Red Bull and everyone else was larger than whatever gap McLaren (or Ferrari) have had when they've objectively been the quickest.\n\nPeople compare this season to 2009 for good reason. If Max holds on, it's because of the opening races being dominant whilst the rest of the season saw multiple teams squabbling over wins.\n\nFerraris update after the summer break has been Red Bulls biggest friend so far. Without it, Lando is probably 20-25 points behind Max currently. But it also means that if McLaren can get ahead of Ferrari, it's a horrendous scenario for Red Bull as you're potentially looking at 5th place.\n\nLando has not been anywhere near good enough at converting his poles though.

The stat i mentioned spans his entire career. Ricciardo was not a retiring driver at that time. He was one of the top rated drivers at that time and everyone's bet was he would dominate Lando.

Every time a new F1 weekend rolls around, it‚Äôs like clockwork. You‚Äôve got a dozen ‚Äújournalists‚Äù recycling the same rumors about Sergio Perez retiring, reshuffling the same tired headlines just to get clicks. And now, with the Mexico GP done and dusted, once again, nothing happens, and Perez is still here. How is this even news anymore?

It‚Äôs lazy journalism, plain and simple, it's dishonest, it's boring and it's repetitive. Instead of focusing on actual developments or meaningful stories within the sport, we get flooded with these BS articles that add absolutely nothing new to the conversation but rile up people needlessly. It‚Äôs beyond frustrating as an F1 fan to see these headlines clogging up my feed week after week. Can we please, for the love of motorsport, stop giving attention to this recycled nonsense and demand something with substance?
