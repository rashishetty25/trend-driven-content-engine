The hunt for the French engineers has already begun. Ferrari, Audi and Red Bull are seizing their chance.\n\nThe unions' fight was ultimately in vain. On September 30, Alpine's parent company Renault confirmed the end of its own engine production in Viry-Châtillon. In the middle of the year, Alpine had already announced that it wanted to use a customer engine from 2026 and convert the factory in Viry-Châtillon into a technology center. Talks with Mercedes about a new partnership are already well advanced behind the scenes.\n\nAfter it finally became clear at the end of September that there would be no more power units from Renault from 2026, the competition is now rubbing its hands together. Ferrari in particular did not hesitate for long. According to information from auto motor und sport, a few dozen engine engineers from Viry-Châtillon have already held job interviews with Ferrari. By hiring high-ranking Renault technicians, Ferrari could buy itself a decisive advantage.\n\nOn the one hand, the Scuderia would gain valuable knowledge, as a prototype for the new engine regulations from 2026 has already been running on the test bench at Renault since June of this year. And on the other hand, Ferrari would weaken its direct competition because the know-how of Renault engineers would not be passed on to its direct competitors."", 'Things about to get Viry spicy.', ""A lot of people are questioning why other teams want Renault's engineers just bc they have the weakest PU on the grid rn.

They can tell you about the direction and ideas that your competitors went down and what was promising or wasn't. There might be some diamonds in the rough. Let's not forget that Brawn's double diffuser idea came in part from Super Aguri which was dogwater.\n\nAlso, just because the end result isn't good, doesn't mean that the staff aren't good themselves. Success in F1 doesn't just come down to the people you have. Case in point is James Allison worked for Ferrari in 2014 and produced the F14T, yet he went to Mercedes and produced the W11."", 'Me hoping for a surprise announcement that Cadillac has bought out the IP and personnel for their engine program.....', 'people in this thread are just kids or completely ignorant.\n\nF1 PU engineers is such a niche market, so being able to hire tens of people with experience is incredibly valuable.\n\nAlso, issues with Renault PUs have to do with not enough funding, it is not a case of lack of talent', 'Give or take I assume it’s for their best engineers and not everyone will have a job once renault PU shuts down.', 'Alpine for better times.', 'I don’t think the competition is really rubbing their hands with glee over what might be the weakest PU in the field, present or future.']",439,41,2024-10-14 16:27:52, News,7,0
