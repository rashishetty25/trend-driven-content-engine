I’ll be marshaling at turn 18, right under the tower at the USGP this weekend. 

I’m planning to make the Ferrari boys each their own authentic Texas felt cowboy hat. I’ll be branding them with a Scud. Ferrari emblem on the front, and their respective name/number on the brim. 

The problem is, cowboy hats are extremely finicky when it comes to sizing. I have scraped the internet to no avail, so this is my last resort: does anybody know where I can get a general idea of head dimensions/hat size/anything for Charles/Carlos? My go to guess will be medium ish for Charles (size 7 - 7 1/8) and large ish for Carlos (size 7 1/4 ish) 

Appreciate any help! If you’ll be at COTA, say hi to your friendly neighborhood marshal wearing a straw lid at T18


Edit: I have emailed/DMed SF directly, as well as Carlos and Charles talent managements. No response :( 

Edit 2: everyone saying not to give gifts, idk I think an authentic lid with the Ferrari logo burned into it would be fitting for at least PR reasons. Who knows, if one of them wins, maybe they’ll take it to the podium. Worst case it’s $100 burned and a few hours of my time ","['I’ll be brutally honest, save your money.

# The Formation Lap

Gather ‘round racing friends, for the tires are warm and it’s time to hit the track… From driver news to team updates and technical tweaks, the eighth edition of *Last Week in Formula 1* is ready to take you on a hot lap.

Before we get started, if you missed last week’s issue [you can catch up here.](https://open.substack.com/pub/lastweekinformula1/p/last-week-in-formula-1-september?r=4apk87&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)

If you’re a rookie ‘round these parts and wondering what you're in for, *Last Week in Formula 1* is a weekly newsletter compiling the most interesting, important, and informative goings-on in the Formula 1 world.

Every fun fact, story, and piece of news has been sourced from posts in r/formula1 (AKA: Formula 1’s publicly accessible online paddock).

Given this is The Internet, take everything you read with a grain of salt. However, after over three years of following the subreddit, there’s far more truth than lies posted—and much of the news comes from reputable sources.

On a semi-related note, like the cars we enjoy watching so much, *Last Week in Formula 1* is in a constant state of development. Any feedback you have on what’s covered, the format, or anything I missed is welcome in the comments.

And if you, like me, enjoy pretty things…

Now let’s get down to business…

# Results & Stats from the Track

Behold, [the most common podium pairs from this season…](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fznbuk/most_common_podium_pairs_this_season/)

Also behold, [this season’s front row start stats…](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0c0e2/front_row_starts_2024/)

You’ll find a familiar ~~face~~ team dominating [2024’s top 10 fastest pit stops…](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0s56w/fastest_pitstops_in_2024_so_far/)

And that’s a wrap on this section! Don’t blame me for the dull week… I don’t make the news or write all these posts, I just compile and report!

\~\~\~

# The Drivers’ Mutterings & Mumblings

*In the absence of any meaningful rumblings and rumours this week…* 

[Alex Albono says he welcomes the challenge of Carlos Sainz at Williams next year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fyw937/formula_1_alex_albon_says_he_will_welcome_carlos/) To be fair though, what else was he going to say? Naturally, [Williams are also backing Mr. Albono to match Señor Sainz behind the wheel in 2025.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0lfk7/williams_backs_brilliant_alex_albon_to_match/)

And at long last…

2022 F2 Champion-turned-Aston Martin Test & Reserve Driver [Felipe Drugovich will drive the AMR24 during FP1 in Mexico](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fzrscx/aston_martin_test_and_reserve_driver_felipe/)—his first ever outing in the car he’s been extensively involved in the development of. I must say, I do hope he gets a chance to show his stuff during an F1 race one day.

For a dose of current F2 driver news, former Red Bull Junior and 2021 rookie F3 Champion [Dennis Hauger rejected an offer from an unnamed F2 team (for what would be his fourth season in the series) to try his luck in Indy NXT](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g2anhv/otviaplay_motor_pod_dennis_hauger_has_rejected_an/) (the feeder series for IndyCar) in 2025. May the downforce be with you in ‘Murica!

\~\~\~

# The Teams’ Twistings & Turnings

There were whispers about this ‘lil diddy around Suzuka time, which faded almost as soon as the paddock left the track. So while this came out of the blue amidst Summer Break #2, [Haas entering a technical partnership with Toyota Gazoo Racing](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g16kv4/haas_f1_team_sporting_a_new_look_on_the_vf24_we/) isn’t a complete surprise—and *is* a big deal. Haas sure has come a long, long way from getting left high and dry by Rich Energy.

While [Toyota has insisted (repeatedly) that their union with Haas isn’t part of a grander plan to fire up an engine program](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g13obv/racefans_toyota_has_stated_clearly_it_has_no_plan/) or return to F1 as works team, that’s not stopping—and won’t—the rumblings and rumours to the contrary.

*This entry comes with a “slightly off-topic” label:* Michael Andretti, son of Mario (one of only three drivers *ever* to win races in Formula 1, IndyCar, the World Sportscar Championship, and NASCAR), [has stepped down from his day-to-day operations role at Andretti Global.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fyd8zq/ot_an_open_letter_from_michael_andretti_andretti/) While he claims the reason his to spend more time with his family, one can’t help but wonder if the so-far-failed attempt at entering F1 he spearheaded is part of the puzzle.

Relatedly, [General Motors hasn’t abandoned joining the grid with their Cadillac brand, and are apparently in charge of the negotiations with F1 now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0jsd1/general_motors_has_not_abandoned_the_idea_of/) 

So… Has the end of Andretti’s hopes and dreams for joining F1 officially come to pass? Who bloody knows, because allegedly [Andretti will have their first 2026 chassis ready before Christmas this year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0da71/exclusive_andretti_will_have_first_2026_f1/) Believe what you wish, I say!

For a quick, final hit of hardly surprising team news, [Williams have held their hands up and said they’ll compromise their 2025 season](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0144d/formula_1_announces_new_multiyear_partnership/) in favour of pouring additional resource into the new 2026 regulations and engine formula. Yeah, you and the rest of the grid… Relatedly, Carlos Sainz Sr. has spilled his beans on [why Young Carlos rejected Audi in favour of Williams.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fzu17g/williams_is_a_project_thats_going_up_carlos/)

# Technical Tidbits

Formula 1 Tire Godking Pirelli will [bring a slew of 2025 soft tire prototypes—including a new C6 compound—to Mexico for testing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fyyggs/tobi_gr%C3%BCner_pirelli_will_bring_2025_prototype/) They also went testing at Mugello with Ferrari this week, [as shown in these pretty pics.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0e698/another_tyre_test_for_ferrari_with_pirelli_at/)

After rumblings and rumours about the new 2026 cars gestating into hot piles of trash that can’t overtake and will have to slow down on the straights in order to recharge their batteries, Aston Martin TP Mike Krack claims that [F1 is/will be in a much better place in 2026 after agreeing to increase the cars’ downforce.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0ca7x/f1_in_a_much_better_place_after_agreeing_to/) Downforce ain’t everything though race fans… Only time will tell!

# Playtime in the Paddock

The (two week long) trend of motorsport personalities doing Reddit AMAs continues with our beloved Martin Brundle—[because he can, and he did.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fzu1mt/hi_im_martin_brundle_former_f1_racing_driver_and/)

Here’s the [juicy ex-Alpine Team Principle Otmar Szafnauer tell-all interview on his abrupt firing and the Piasco](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fy0mud/otmar_szafnauer_exclusive_the_truth_behind_my/) (that you’ve surely been waiting months for).

Redditor of 4.5K (and growing) new karmic wealth, u/Aggressive_Fee6507, [took his lion out for a walk in London, enabling him to run into everyone’s favourite FIA-branded punching bag, Mohammed Ben Sulayem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g2w56d/just_out_for_a_stroll/)

Everyone’s favourite swear bear Guenther Steiner dished out an interview this week with the New York Times, sharing that [he’s savouring post-F1 Team Principle life and “doesn’t need Gene Haas anymore.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g25vrq/guenther_steiner_savors_postf1_team_boss_life_i/) Byegene!

F1’s favourite rookie, Fernando Alonso spilled the beans on—and I loosely quote—[the past, the present, the future, engaging a new generation of fans, giving back to the sport he loves so dearly, and his long-awaited 33rd win.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g21n21/undercut_fernando_alonso_forever_young_fernando/)

Never seen an F1 car up close and personal? Wanna get a good idea of how big their tires are? [Using this banana plushie for scale](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fyd575/some_tyres_at_singapore_gp_last_year_with_banana/) should surely help.

Biased (yet insightful) as he may be, Ferrari’s driver coach Jock Clear addressed [why he believes Charles has got the ‘stuff’ to become WDC.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fy6eak/jock_clear_charles_driver_coach_absolutely/)

Amidst the dog days of Summer Break #2, the fine folks at the Mercedes factory in [Brackley have been keeping busy by rehoming their (now formerly) resident lizards.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fz3hgn/mercedes_f1_team_rehomes_lizards_found_at/) Somewhere in the jungle, Danica Patrick is screeching…

Following in their few weeks old footsteps of announcing [their long-term partnership with Lego,](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fjsy23/formula_1_were_putting_play_in_pole_position/) F1 has continued their impressive quest for commercial domination by [joining forces with Hot Wheels.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0144d/formula_1_announces_new_multiyear_partnership/) Don’t get your hopes up for finding these cars in grocery store bargain bins though.

*To close with a 100% off-topic-but-interesting-nonetheless entry…*

~~Neo from The Matrix~~ F1 fan [Keanu Reeves made his racing debut in the Toyota GR Cup series last weekend.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fxk2df/actor_keanu_reeves_spins_car_finishes_25th_in/) He qualified 31st out of 35 cars, then impressively climbed through the pack to 21st before spinning and finishing 25th.
