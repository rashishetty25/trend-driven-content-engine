No need to change any rules, no need for different stewards to interpret the somewhat vague rules in different ways, just very clear ""off track is bad, dont go there"".

https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga7lqk/by_request_i_also_compiled_all_the_f1_rules/

After compiling lists of rule changes and clarifications prompted by Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton, several users suggested I create a similar breakdown for Sebastian Vettel. However, in researching Vettel‚Äôs career, I discovered that while he was certainly involved in high-profile incidents, relatively few resulted in formal rule changes or FIA clarifications directly because of his actions.

In fact, only two racing incidents directly led to regulatory changes or clarifications. 

- - - 

**1. Team Orders and the ‚ÄúMulti-21‚Äù Incident**

Race: 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix

Incident: During the final stages of the race, Red Bull instructed Vettel to hold his position behind teammate Mark Webber using the ""Multi-21"" code. Ignoring the directive, Vettel overtook Webber, leading to significant tension within the team and sparking wider debates on team orders in F1.

Rule Discussion: Although the incident did not result in a formal rule change, it led the FIA to reinforce its stance that team orders were permissible within teams but that the enforcement was up to the teams themselves. This set a precedent for how team orders would be handled going forward, emphasizing FIA neutrality in intra-team directives‚Äã.


**2. Helmet Design Restrictions**

Year Introduced: 2015

Incident: Known for debuting new helmet designs almost every race during his time with Red Bull, Vettel‚Äôs constant changes created issues with driver recognition, particularly for fans and officials who sometimes found it difficult to identify him on track.

Rule Change: To enhance driver visibility and consistency, the FIA implemented a rule limiting drivers to a single primary helmet design per season, with allowances for one special event helmet. This rule was a direct response to (mostly) Vettel‚Äôs frequent design changes and aimed to maintain a consistent look for each driver throughout the season.‚Äã
‚Äã

**3. Track Re-Entry Safety**

Race: 2019 Canadian Grand Prix

Incident: Leading the race, Vettel ran off-track under pressure from Hamilton. When he rejoined, his manoeuvre forced Hamilton to slow to avoid a collision, leading to a five-second penalty that cost Vettel the race win and sparked intense debate about fair re-entry practices.

Rule Clarification: The FIA responded by clarifying its rules around track re-entry, specifying that drivers must rejoin the track safely without impeding others or forcing them to change their racing line. This clarification helped to set clearer expectations for safe re-entry in similar scenarios going forward‚Äã.
‚Äã

**4. Advocacy for Consistency in Stewarding**

Years: 2020-2021 (Various races)

Incident: Over multiple races, Vettel vocally criticized inconsistencies in stewarding, especially concerning track limits, penalty decisions, and race director judgments. His frustration highlighted the need for uniform rule enforcement and drew attention to the impact of inconsistent decision-making on race outcomes.

Rule Discussion: Although this advocacy didn‚Äôt lead to any specific rule change, it fueled discussions around fairness in penalty application and contributed to a broader movement for consistent rule enforcement. The FIA ultimately restructured its approach to race direction following the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, suggesting that Vettel‚Äôs efforts may have nudged F1 in a more consistent direction‚Äã.


**5. Concerns About the Virtual Safety Car Loophole**

(*edit: added after suggestion by /u/cafk)*

Year: 2021

Incident: Vettel voiced concerns about drivers exploiting loopholes in the VSC system, specifically how some were gaining an unfair advantage during race situations. He emphasized the need for clearer rules to maintain fair competition.

Rule clarification: Following his remarks, the FIA acknowledged these concerns and committed to reviewing and addressing the VSC system to close any loopholes, showcasing how Vettel's advocacy influenced ongoing discussions about rule enforcement in F1.

- - - 


To give a fuller picture, I‚Äôve also included some debatable cases where Vettel‚Äôs actions sparked discussions or reinforced existing rules but I believe did not prompt specific rule changes or clarifications.

**Debatable Incidents Not Included:**

**1. Multi-Weaving in Defensive Moves**

Race: 2012 Italian Grand Prix

Incident: Vettel‚Äôs defensive move at Curva Grande pushed Fernando Alonso off-track, leading to a drive-through penalty.

Reason Not Included: The penalty reinforced the ‚Äúone-move‚Äù rule in defensive driving but did not prompt a new rule or a further clarification on defensive tactics.

**2. Collision with Hamilton Behind Safety Car**

Race: 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Incident: Believing Hamilton had brake-checked him, Vettel collided with Hamilton under the safety car and pulled alongside to express his frustration, which led to a time penalty.

Reason Not Included: Although it reinforced standards of sportsmanship under caution, it did not lead to a formal rule change or clarification. The FIA upheld existing standards on conduct during the safety car without redefining them.

**3. Overtaking on Pit Lane Entry**

(*edit: added after suggestion by /u/cafk)*

Race: 2016 Chinese Grand Prix

Incident: While entering the pits, Vettel overtook ~~Daniil Kyvat~~ Jenson Button and Carlos Sainz on the pit lane entry, highlighting an ambiguous area in the rules regarding overtaking in non-race conditions like pit lane entry.
Outcome: Although Vettel‚Äôs maneuver raised questions and sparked discussion about whether overtaking should be restricted in the pit entry area, the FIA chose not to issue a clarification or rule change at the time.

His team mate Frentzen was one of the best drivers of the 90s and he doubled his points. Williams had the clear best car, but not dominant. Newey wasn't around that year as he was on gardening leave."", 'You could argue that Villeneuve made too many mistakes to make it close. Car performance should have had Williams walk the title. Schumacher maximised every race he finished in, possibly only mistake was Austria with the yellow flag. And of course Jerez.', 'In a decade that has Senna, Mansell, Prost, Berger, Schumacher, Piquet, Alesi, Hakkinen, Hill, Barichello and Coulthard to say Frentzen was one of the best is not accurate.', ""Williams got rinsed when it came to the development race. The year started out with Villeneuve outqualifying the entire field by 2 seconds in Australia, but Ferrari closed that gap down at a rate of knots. Certainly by the second half of the year the difference in performance between Williams and Ferrari was small enough that Schumacher's talent advantage could make up the difference.\n\nWilliams actually had to pause development on their 1998 car to bring upgrades to the FW19 to prevent the title slipping away, which also explains why the 1998 car ended up so undercooked."", ""Yes, he made a few mistakes, but still smashed his team mate. Hyper focusing on mistakes loses the full picture, because despite the mistakes his best performances make up for it. \n\nI think, herein lies the crux of the issue. Villeneuve loses from being compared to Schumacher. Obviously Schumacher was the best driver in 1997 by a clear margin, but that doesn't mean Villeneuve didn't have a strong season himself. I doubt any driver in 1997 would've done better in that Williams apart from Michael himself."", ""Really? I implore you to check out Frentzen's record against his team mates. It's sublime. His only bad seasons relative to his team mates are 1997 and 2001.\n\nOut of all those drivers, I would definitely put Senna, Prost, and Schumacher above Frentzen. The rest are either on par or below.\n\nCoulthard? Not a chance. Doesn't even belong in the conversation."", '94-03 only 2 strong drives has: schumacher and mika. the other drivers before after "" can‚Äôt compete""', ""That's more on Williams than Ferrari to be fair then. Schumacher was the better driver that season. Villeneuve also got lucky a number of times with retirements giving him wins in Silverstone, Luxembourg and even Hungary with Hill's problem he wasn't on to win any of those races."", ""Possibly I guess we'll never know but whilst Villeneuve outscored Frentzen almost double the points it was arguably a bad season for Frentzen, possibly his worst and he suffered more mechanical woes than Villeneuve did. I reckon Hill in that Williams would have secured the title before the final race.""]",13,23,2024-10-25 22:22:09, Video,0,0

The line oft repeated is that each position in the championship is worth millions to the teams, however, with the 2026 regulation change looming, and the fact that teams are unable to work on the 2026 cars until the 1st of January 2025, it's made me begin to wonder if finishing 3rd in the WCC might benefit Red Bull in their preparations for the regulation changes.

Each position lost gains a significant extra chunk of wind tunnel runs and CFD time. Is this enough of a benefit for 2026 that it outweighs the financial penalty of finishing further down the table and thus means Sergio's lack of performance is being left unaddressed?
