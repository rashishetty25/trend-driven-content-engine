No new PU because of the cost cap, it\'d only improve lap times ""fractionally"" but has big impact financially so the trade is not worth it (info: remember his current PU is fresh having done the Baku race, Singapore weekend and up to Saturday, FP1, Sprint Quali and Race, and only Q1 in Quali).\n\n\n- Q: Why the difference in performance between Sprint Quali and the rest of the weekend?\n\n\nA: Allison\'s guess is that they ran the cars a bit too low, which improve lap times but also makes the car more unstable and sensitive to bumps and cross-winds if you push your luck too much, which they did.\n\n\n- Q: What was Lewis\' suspension issue and was it fixed for the race?\n\n\nA: A bearing holding a wishbone in the front suspension had started to break-up, leading to rear looseness and instability. It was fully fixed for qualifying and the race.\n\n\n- Q: Why did George have to start from the pit lane?\xa0\n\n\nA: After his crash they had to work on the car outside the authorized hours, triggering an automatic start from the pits.\n\n\n- Q: Did the car have the pace to finish on the podium?\n\n\nA: Allison\'s opinion is no, although they had similar pace to McLaren and Verstappen, P6 was the best the car could get, they\'d have just finished closer to the front pack.\n\n\n- Q: Did the upgrades deliver and what were the problems?\n\n\nA: Yes, the expected downforce was there. The data didn\'t show any issues prior to any of the spins. Less time to dial in with one practice session and the spins in FP, George\'s crash and Lewis\' spin on Sunday.\nThey are still excited about the new package and the issues were most likely down to running the car too low, too stiff, compromising the handling beyond what was acceptable.', ""How can James say there was no reason to think Lewis' setup needed to be changed when Lewis himself said his setup needed to be changed because the balance was all over the place?\n\nJust say the engineers all needed to fix George's car and move on, no need for smoke and mirrors."", 'We have Lewis and George at home\n\nLewis and George at home:', 'oh my God I snorted hahahha', 'Lmaooooo', 'Thank you!', ""Lewis wasn't the only one saying that. Shovlin and Toto did, too. Shovlin even said Lewis' car was still struggling with balance after qualifying.\n\nApparently, the floors in the new upgrades are the one they tried to use in Spa but took them out because they couldn't get it to work right. I think they are desperate to get this upgrade to work with the car and just keep pushing it because it would be a waste of time and money otherwise."", ""Yeah, these have become less informative lately. Seems like they're trying to smooth over their mistakes instead of explaining them like they used to do. \n\nThey had multiple reasons to start Hamilton from the pit lane, they were dreadful in race pace during the Sprint, and Lewis damn near qualified last for the race, while George smashed his car into a wall. \n\nI can't understand how James can say they had no reason to change Hamilton's setup and have him start in the pit lane.\n\nLewis literally said that was the only way to have a shot on Sunday, which turned out to be true, as George did very well, albeit with the old parts on the car, whereas Lewis spun off all by himself. \n\nWhich is only the 2nd time that's ever happened to him, the other being the final lap of the 2009 Italian Grand Prix when he was fighting Button for a podium."", 'would I agree with you on the part that seems lately they are picking line to answer, in this case that was the question about starting Lewis from pits, which was a. about engine  b. about setup and James answered only about engine. But again, they are only team that doing that kind of debriefs, you can expect them picking questions to answer and way they answer them, good that they are still doing that not only during glory era.\n\nIn general, after this iteration of ""seems we run car to low and to hard"" and ""hard to setup on sprint weekends"" and what we have seen in quali and race, I have feeling that George and Lewis driving one of the hardest to drive cars on the grid, expectations are high, pressure is high, but car so fcking terrible to drive and setup. If Lewis was driving Ferrari this weekend, it would be like his normal weekend 5 years ago: -30 seconds get in there Lewis blessed runs.  In quali I don\'t even expect purple sectors from him, because I know that softs cannot last more than 3/4 of the lap on W15, so if 1st sector was good, last one would be yellow.']",4,10,2024-10-24 17:20:27, Video,1,0
