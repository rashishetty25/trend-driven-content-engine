1gb8cq6,About Alonso's supposed 400th Grand Prix start this weekend,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb8cq6/about_alonsos_supposed_400th_grand_prix_start/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb8cq6/about_alonsos_supposed_400th_grand_prix_start/,2024-10-24,0 days,"This weekend is marked by the celebration of Alonso's 400th GP, which is an impressive number never achieved before. But after checking in the [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/en/drivers/fernando-alonso) and [Stats F1](https://www.statsf1.com/en/fernando-alonso.aspx) websites, I've realized that this weekend is NOT his 400th GP start, but rather his 400th GP entered.

  
In reality, Alonso is currently at 396 races started. It's important to clarify that the differences in races entered and races started is marked by the DNS (Did not start), which by its own definition doesn't count as a started race. During Alonso's career there have been 3 DNS.

  
1. Belgium 2001: This one is pretty interesting, since Fernando actually started and did 3 laps before retiring due to a broken gearshaft. In lap 4 there was a massive crash between the Prost of Burti and the Jaguar of Irvine which triggered a red flag. Following the regulations of the time, the first 4 laps were voided, meaning that officialy, Alonso never started the race.

2. USA 2005: Well, this one is mostly known, but after issues with the Michelin tyres during practice, all teams using them pulled in at the end of the formation lap and did not start the race, including Alonso.

3. Russia 2017: Engine issue during the formation lap which forced Alonso to fail to start the race.

  
All of this means that Alonso is currently sitting at 399 entered GPs and 396 started GPs. This weekend will be his 400th **entered race**, and if he manages to start all the following races, **he will start his 400th race in Qatar**.","[""Y'all ruin everything. You were supposed to wait until he retires with 500 GP starts THEN bring this up, so he has to come back and complete his last 3 races to earn the title, Mr. 500."", "">he will start his 400th race in Qatar.\n\nWe'll see about that, hope he feels better for FP2."", 'I am impressed he didn’t suffer from any engine DNS with the amount of time he raced for Renault/Alpine.', 'LOL F1 Instagram [stories](https://imgur.com/a/DUD6voG) setting the record straight', 'This is silly, it\'s his 400th GP, which is a full weekend, made up of multiple stages\n\n400 ""Starts"" is being taken too literally as in just the Race part of the weekend, other sites have it listed as his ""400th GP Weekend"". \n\nI\'d argue though, once you are entered and the weekend has started, that counts as a GP start, regardless if you DNS the actual race, but idk how the stats are looked at', 'These milestones are always marked by number of races entered rather than number of races started. And I’d argue in Alonso’s case since he at least started the formation lap of all three races he’s had recorded as a DNS, it’s pretty disingenuous to argue that this weekend isn’t his 400th race.', 'Hmm. \n\nSainz recently had his 200th (200rd? 😄) race and I remember they must have taken his DNS stats into consideration because he started on the exact same race as Max but their 200th races were a few races apart.', ""If you count Sprints (which I know we don't, don't throw hands at me) then he's surpassed 400 even without the DNSs"", ""Technically, and specifically, correct.

The problem was that Max was able to boost his defence by leaving the track. Leaving the track, notwithstanding being forced off by another driver, should NEVER be rewarded by the rule book. \n\nIf Max had stayed within the track, got to the apex first, I have no issue with him not affording Norris space. The problem was staying within the track was not compatible with getting to the apex first. This should have been penalised but is possibly a grey area in the rules', 'Can’t we all agree that while we have a framework of rules, many decisions—especially in close racing—will always be subjective? It’s impossible to write a rulebook that covers every situation perfectly. Stewards should have the ultimate authority in such cases.\n\nTake the Lando and Max situation, for example. Lando had the better run into the corner, and if telemetry shows he would have made the corner if Max hadn’t forced him off, then it’s clear-cut. If Max eased off his brakes more than usual to stay ahead and caused the contact, it’s simple: give Lando 5 seconds for overtaking off track and Max 5 seconds for forcing him off. The penalties cancel each other out, and they race on.\n\nThe rule about being ahead at the apex is fine, but Max’s move wasn’t “in the spirit of the rules.” Formula 1 has used that term before—why not apply it to driving? If you manipulate your braking just to be ahead, you’re not following the spirit of the apex rule and should be penalized.\n\nI don’t see why the FIA needs to complicate things by searching for black-and-white rules for every situation.', ""My opinion is they should go back to something like this:\n\nIf you choose the inside line, you must:\n\n* Make the corner fully within the track limits.\n* If the other car has their front wing alongside your cockpit at the apex, you must leave half a car's width to the white line to allow for the other car to make the corner as well\n* If you do not leave the space, the other car has the right to continue off track to maintain position. If it is a corner where this is not possible, sort the matter out or it will be referred to the stewards.\n\nAs the leading car this means you can reasonably defend by taking a slightly tighter line, without the risk of being mugged down the inside by someone braking all the way to the exit curb. You still have to defend, but if someone wants to dive bomb you, you can still fight for your spot.\n\nIf you're trailing on the outside, you make a decision at the apex as to whether or not you can fight for the exit curb or not. If you're leading or roughly alongside, you can expect to always have the faster exit out of the corner."", 'I think we all do. The problem is the FIA is seemingly incapable of making consistent judgments. Max floors it off track and overtakes in Austria, no penalty. Lando overtakes off track in Austin, penalty.', ""The major thing that needs to be enforced is consistency in stewarding. If they decide to be sporadic about their rulings, any rule enforcement, whether old or new, can be bent to fit the situation at hand. \n\nIt's funny how the FIA is willing to put up with the vitriol behind these controversies sometimes. Similar situations have transpired over the years, team personnel and media aficionados have called for transparency in ruling, yet it doesn't feel like anything has changed.
