*But* that penalty was inconsistent to what we’ve seen recently - most notably t1 with Norris and Verstappen. So, for the purpose of this post let’s ignore Russel’s penalty as that’s another whole discussion.  

If the rules for the most part are that you can get away with that then why is that the case?
You can just go into a corner and escort your opponent wide? What’s with that? - we will never see any interesting racing.

Especially when the driver that’s been pushed off can’t even fight back because they’ll get a penalty for “keeping the position by going off track” when they had nowhere else to go. 

If it were up to me you’d have to leave a cars width to the car on the outside, when overtaking and defending, as is the rules in most other respects of motorsport afaik. 

Am I alone in thinking this?

Apparently there is a more recent version but not publicly available. Key point is 


Guidelines for overtaking on the outside of a corner:


- In order for a car being overtaken to be required to give sufficient room to an overtaking car, the
overtaking car needs to have a significant portion of the car alongside the car being overtaken and
the overtaking manoeuvre must be done in a safe and controlled manner, while enabling the car to
clearly remain within the limits of the track.

- When considering what is a ‘significant portion’, for an overtaking on the outside of a corner, among
the various factors that will be looked at by the stewards when exercising their discretion, the
stewards will consider if the overtaking car is ahead of the other car from the apex of the corner.

- The car being overtaken must be capable of making the corner while remaining within the limits of
the track.


So Lando wasn't ahead at the apex hence wasn't entitled to room. However, the last point says that Max must be capable of making the corner as well. So IMO they are both in the wrong (or call it a racing incident). Thoughts?

EDIT: obviously these are 'guidelines' only but you would hope stewards would attempt to follow them for consistency","['The ""among the various factors the stewards will consider"" part is clear as fucking mud.\n\nI mean obviously they don\'t think being ahead at the apex is the only factor, or they\'d just say that, but instead they seem to be calling that out as the main factor but not the only one. As a result I can see why Lando\'s so pissed, if the only thing that matters is being ahead at the apex, just say that.', ""Both did something wrong (leaving the track).\n\nI assume the stewards saw wrongdoing from both Verstappen and Norris because both were too fast for the corner, kind of offsetting each other.\n\nThat doesn't mean Norris is allowed to overtake off track though."", 'It would have been a racing incident if Lando had not gained a position. He did, and therefore, penalty.', "">So IMO they are both in the wrong (or call it a racing incident).\n\nYou are correct, they're both in the wrong for leaving the track, so it offsets, racing incident. \n\nWhile off track, Lando then passed Max, causing the penalty."", 'Agreed. Either both penalties or , what it should be classed as, good hard racing.', 'Broken link', 'Both wrong, but one more wrong basically (by way of how far off the track he went) + Being behind at the Apex + Gaining a lasting advantage at the end of it all. \n\n  \nThats 3 reasons all of which in my opinion make it an easy Slam Dunk penalty.', ""Just want to say that from 1 January 2025, the Driving Standards Guideline will be codified into Appendix L of the International Sporting Code and will be applicable to all circuit racing which follows the Code.\n\n[This has come about from the FIA Drivers' Committee in partnership with the FIA’s Circuit Commission and Safety Department.](https://www.fia.com/news/fia-drivers-committee-delivers-driving-standards-guidelines-circuit-racing-championships)\n\nSo in future we will have a consistent reference point to shout about."", ""If both drivers had been given a 5 second penalty there'd by no controversy at all. Russel got 5 seconds for going down the inside, staying on track and forcing Bottas off.

As for overtaking on the outside of a corner, the guidelines acknowledge that it is a more difficult move to pull off.

For a long time drivers have been taught from karting all the way through the racing pyramid that if you try to hang it round the outside, you are at risk of running out of road.

It’s often been left up to how hard certain drivers race. ‘Fairer’ drivers will leave a bit of room for their rivals, more ruthless drivers will edge them out.

But in recent years there has been a clear effort to define when it’s essential for a driver to leave space, and that’s the case in the new guidelines as well.

So, for a driver to be given room when overtaking on the outside, including at the exit of the corner, the overtaking car must:

-Have the front axle AT LEAST ALONGSIDE the front axle of the other car at the apex of the corner AND to the exit
-Be driven in a safe and controlled manner throughout the manoeuvre (entry, apex and exit)
-Be able to make the corner within the track limits

In a lot of cases this is going to leave a driver at the mercy of their rival or the laws of physics as cars on the inside wash out.

This isn’t intended to stop an optimistic pass, it just means drivers have to accept the risks involved. It is quite close to being a codified ‘live by the sword, die by the sword’ rule.

Now three times from memory, he's failed to take a position in the faster car, Austria , Britain and now Austin.
I don't want to go too much into Austria but I felt he was silly to attempt and outside overtake at that corner, especially up against MV.
At the British GP, unable to hunt down Hamilton, in US had time but again went outside, difficult and add to that you have Max Verstappen. In my neutral view , it was a simple decision gained an advantage over the white line.

But before I do, I want to say I am a Norris fan and if some parts of this question come across as biased I am sorry, but I am also only human.

Now the important part.  
I see McLaren (and some others) fans complaining that the stewards are not consistent with their decision and citing the Russel incident was handled differently than the Norris-Verstappen incident. BUT again other people argue, that those 2 incidents are not comparable, because Russel was attacking and Verstappen was defending. And I totally agree that those two scenarios should be handled differently, attacker and defender should have different rules applied to them.

And now the question: ""When is an overtaking attempt finished?""

I looked at the TV camera angles and Norris POV again (because I could not find Verstappen POV, pls link if someone can find it) and it looks like Norris is with the full car ahead on the straight already. Could someone argue, that that means, that Norris was not the attacker in the corner but the defender and Verstappen was the (re-)attacker in that scenario.

Is there something in the rulebook, that defines, when an overtaking attempt is over? (and was successful or not?) I would really like an answer and am not just trying to be salty, I hope I wrote this question neutral enough.","[""I'd just think daily normal traffic... I don't really consider that I have overtaken a truck on a 100km/h road before I'm back in my own lane and don't have to consider the truck's position anymore."", ""What I guess is that you need to be\n\n1. Ahead before braking\n\n2. Ahead before turning\n\n3. Ahead at apex\n\n4.

If the overtaking car is ahead, the defending car can no longer contest the position without significant risk.\n* **Defender's Responsibility**: According to\xa0**Article 27**, defending drivers must leave at least one car width for an attacking car that has a significant portion alongside them. If a defending driver forces another car off track, this can lead to penalties, emphasizing that different rules apply to attackers and defenders.\n* **Penalties for Leaving Track Limits**: If a driver leaves the track to overtake, they must return to their original position if they gained an advantage by doing so.
