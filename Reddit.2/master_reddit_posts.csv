1g2i75w,Prema struggles logic ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g2i75w/prema_struggles_logic/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g2i75w/prema_struggles_logic/,2024-10-13,0 days,"Prema has been regarded as the best F3/F2 team to be in up untill this year. In 2024 Prema  isn't as good and it has been generally accepted opinion that because of Prema struggles their drivers who both got promoted to F1 can't show their true potential. Reasoning behind their promotions is for Antonelli: impressive F4 and FRECA career and beating Bearman. For Bearman is his P3 as a rookie in F3 and P6 as a rookie in F2 last year and his Jeddah stint for now he is 13th in F2 standings.
I have genuine questions about ""Prema is shit argument"".

- Firstly F2 is supposed to have equal cars so weren't people upset with Prema being the best or one of the best team in recent years as it gives some drivers with usually more money an unfair advantage? Like right now some people seem almost annoyed that Prema is not as good as last year. It literally means that their drivers don't have an advantage over others anymore. And imo Prema is still like in top 5 teams.

I must say it but both current Prema drivers has been talked as a 'next F1 stars' and has been fan favourites long before this year. Antonelli's hype as a next Merc driver started after he won F4s and FRECA and Bearman was already reserve driver for Ferrari this year. Also it is not hard to notice that both Kimi and Ollie come from very wealthy families and have connections (especially Kimi's dad). With Prema past reputation I can somewhat see it as a golden ticket in feeder series only for the most priviliged.

- Second question: If we accept ""because of Prema struggles drivers can't show their full  potential"" logic. We should also acknowledge that in the past Prema drivers could look better than they really were but nobody is using this logic in reverse. Bearman accomplished P3 in F3 and P6 in F2 with Prema when they were arguably one of the best teams. Why everybody put all the blame on Prema for Bearman poor performance (plus a bit of bad luck) this year but nobody  acknowleges that he had some team advantage in 2022 and 2023 which could influence his standings? ","[""Prema drivers generally have high budget. High budget drivers have new chassis and parts whenever they need them, which is always an advantage over drivers with three or more year old chassis cobbled together with repaired parts. (Of course, there are high budget drivers on other teams too.) This year, however, everyone started F2 with a fresh, brand new chassis. So that part is equal. This year in F2 they also couldn't rely on data that the drivers the years before gathered, so it was all on current drivers and current engineers. And Bearman clearly had his head and heart in F1 for the whole year, and F2 was an afterthought. And Antonelli split some of his time too. Driving multiple vehicles is difficult. It really doesn't help when the more experienced driver has quite possibly had an F1 contract all year and known that F2 was a formality for extra track time."", ""Literally everyone who follows the feeder series uses this logic in reverse. Look back at any threads regarding Mick's junior career."", '>I have genuine questions about ""Prema is shit argument"".\n\nIf you look at all of their results in all of the series that they participate in and have participated in, Formula 2 is one of their worst series. Their reputation is built on success in the lower tiers of the support categories. And it\'s not just a 2024 problem, either -- they are wildly inconsistent. Look at their 2019 season, when they finished *ninth* overall. In eight years of Formula 2, they\'ve won the teams\' championship twice and finished second twice. Compare that to six years for Formula 3, where they have won the teams\' championship five times and finished second in the other. Or six years in Formula Regional Europe, where they have five teams\' titles and one third place. Or eleven years of Italian Formula 4, where they have eight teams\' titles and three second places.', 'People interpret things the way they want to with their bias. \n\nIf driver they like wins it’s their skill and incredibleness. If driver they like is doing badly it’s the team. \n\nIf driver they like is in a fast car, it’s because of his technical knowledge and set up knowledge helping push the team forward. If a driver they like is in a bad car, it’s because they team  don’t know how to develop or set up their car. \n\nIf a driver they like is rude and loud it’s because he has personality and is a character which is missing from PR drilled drivers these days. If it’s a driver you hate doing the same thing, he’s just rude and disrespectful.', ""So because it was a new regulations/car change for f2, some teams got new set ups right immediately and some teams didn't. Just because the cars are more equal does not mean that set up does not matter. Prema got it wrong and it remained wrong for much of the first half of the season and thus their drivers really did not have a shot. Think of it like aston martin that one year where they got it right and were getting podiums and then boom they got it wrong and were suddenly nowhere again. That happens in Motor sport. \n\nIn Ollie's case people give him the benefit of the doubt not only because he has proved not once but twice now that he can succeed in an f1 car but also because he was flat out good last year. He got literally everything you can get in baku last year including pole lap with a broken steering column so his steering wheel wasn't straight. Two things could have happened from last year to this year one he suddenly fell off considerably (which we know is not true from his f1 performances) or two prema fell off hard which is what fans have decided is true and clearly the teams agree to based on his and kimi's promotions. \n\nPrema should have been a team capable of fighting for the championship this year but they aren't they got their act together way to late this year (and in ollie's case it doesn't help for his f2 campaign that he got pulled from two of his best tracks including one of the few early races prema looked decent in and that he had a pole for) making a title run basically impossible so then you judge the drivers based on what they can get out of the car. Its like f1 no one is saying that a williams driver should be regularly winning races the car is just not there so they don't expect it. Prema is a midfield team this year and expectations seem to have been adjusted accordingly.\n\nAs for Ollie taking F2 less seriously, overall pretty much knew from the start of the year he was being promoted. He had 6 FP1s with Haas scheduled BEFORE he got the call up in Jeddah. You don't get 6 FPs announced at a single team and a single team that is NOT your driver academy's team at the very beginning of the year unless you are getting the seat. Then Jeddah happened and I am pretty sure he was told to no longer worry about placing super high in F2...which is fair considering he just had a pole and likely a pretty high finish taken away from him he lost a full weekend of points which with only 14 weekends creates a pretty difficult gap to close AND he just proved he could race in F1 on one of the hardest tracks of the year which honestly is worth more to teams than a good f2 showing because nothing proves you can drive in f1 like driving in f1. So even if it was not announced until his future home race at silverstone Ollie was almost certainly given the handshake that he was getting the seat after Jeddah. And once you have the seat your focus turns to how to best prep for f1 which includes doing your best in fps even if it compromises your f2 races. \n\nTLDR: Either Prema shit the bed this year and thus the results are not representative of the drivers or two very talented drivers forgot how to drive this year and in ollie's case we know the second is not true so it has to be the first and people are acting accordingly. People are judging Ollie off all the info available which includes his f1 stints. Is that unfair to other drivers who didn't get the chance? Maybe but luck already plays a huge role in who gets promoted. You can be super talented but if the right affiliated seat does not appear at the right time your screwed. Like Colapinto and Lawson no one was really singing their praises that they were worthy of getting a seat until they got a shot and proved they were worthy that is just how things go and Ollie probably didn't need that shot based on the number of fp1s he was already scheduled for even before Carlos' appendix decided to bounce."", 'For me it\'s all purely bias anyways. There\'s always pre-determimed favourites and if they don\'t perform as expected there\'s excuses. When a driver nobody is talking about suddenly does good, it\'s because they just inherited a rocketship. Really we can only make educated guesses.\n\nReality is we don\'t know who the best driver is because all the teams come with varying degrees of performance and we just dont know who is really doing the best job there.  This has always been the case and is a problem that goes all the way down to Karting. The rich drivers can pay for the best machinery and pay for extra testing, that makes discovering raw talent tough because the wealthier guys will always have an unfair advatange. So, for all we know the best driver in F2 could be someone in one of the underperforming teams that nobody is talking about, trying to get by on a budget. Colapinto for example was on nobodies radar until a chance drive with Williams, very likely nobody would ever be raving about him had he not been given that chance. He\'d just be seen as another ""mid"" F2 driver with no excuses to back him up, because he wasn\'t one of the pre-season favourites.\n\nPeople will say the teams have the data so know what they\'re doing. However, honestly have to question that sometimes. Its not like the teams can see what every driver is doing in detial andsee how their teams are performing. They only really know the drivers they have under them and even at that, they sometimes can make the wrong decision(Sargeant or De Vries as recent examples). Like at one point Ferrari had all the data on Antonelli in Karting but turned him down from their academy. So what did Mercedes see in Kimi that Ferrari did not? If he\'s such a star, why did Ferrari not want to back a hyper talented Italian driver. Sometimes got to question what the conditions are for making these academies. Like what constitutes performance/talent for them?', 'Also how many drivers drove for teams other than Prema in previous years and never got a F1 seat because they never looked good, despite the fact they were potentially maximising the cars potential but still fell behind behind Prema drivers who were not.', 'Overall I agree apart from Bearman argument that he had his head already in F1 from the beginning of the year. I get his Jeddah stint and FPs with Haas but other than that he had no reasons not to be focused on F2. It could only be remotely possible if he literally had his contract signed after Jeddah or somehow knew he is getting F1 seat no matter the results. And imo intentionally not focusing on your F2 career while it is his job for 2024 and there are many drivers dreaming to be in his position comes across as a bit disrespectful and entilted. That\'s why I am not buying this ""excuse"".', 'I argue totally different with Mick.\n\nAlthough he won the F2 title, he did it in about the least impressive way, being on average the 6th fastest driver in races.\n\nNothing about the team, the driver was lacklustre in winning rhe title.']",0,19,2024-10-13 22:20:30, Discussion,0,0

The Southeast Asian country has put a proposal on the table that is very close to Liberty Media's current concept, with a street race in the Incheon district, a location very close to the capital Seoul.\n\nSouth Korea was one of those Asian countries that Bernie Ecclestone had his eye on in the latter part of his time as Formula 1's chief executive.

The Key Points was the new Rules are too complex, Engine too reliant on Chassis design and reloading the Battery. Customers Team will get the Engines Layout way too late and will be compromised alot. 

They also talked this with Fred Vasseur about this and he confirmed that customers Team won't have a Chance in the new Rules. Renault Vyril PU Engineers also this to Renault CEO.

Aston Martin knew this from the beginning and signed with Honda.

So what option does McLaren have now? 



","['I’m pretty sure that part of the deal to keep McLaren at Mercedes was that they get to be in the room when the engine is being developed. The threat from RBPT was that big at the time that Mercedes gave away the advantage they would have had over McLaren.\n\nEDIT: [here’s an article about it.](https://speedcafe.com/mclaren-influence-mercedes-engine-development-2026/)', ""So generally this has been common wisdom in F1 and why generally the top 3-4 teams will always be a works team and why that is a very coveted seat to fill.\n\nIt's why the McHonda disaster happened in the first place and why RB-Renault relations have always been strained especially since Renault re-entered the sport (and subsequently flopped hard in the hybrid era).\n\nHOWEVER, teams are not nearly secretive as before and particularly Mercedes have had better collaboration with customers than you would see historically from engine manufacturers. secondly, the FIA during the early days of the hybrid era has slammed down on special engine maps only available to works teams i.e 'Party Mode' and we will expect to see parity from the software side now too.\n\nIt does however limit designers especially people like Newey who design the car wholistically and would like to have a say on engine dimensions/packaging to suit his Aero needs. On this part customer teams have their hands tied a bit.\n\nIt's not a silver bullet tho and imo short term customer teams with good engines will have better luck than works teams with bad engines."", 'No\n\nMcLaren will be a VIP customer (or customer with some advantages in the engine development process) so they could be like Force India or Williams in 2014-16 (with better economics).', ""Absolutely! Things are always up in the air when it comes to new regulations, but this should be the most level playing field during a regulations change in F1 history.\n\n7 teams will have similar facilities, workforces and be running at the cost cap. The manufactrers PU development is being done under a cost cap and there are strict regulations regarding supply parity, engine modes, mounting points and dissemination of information through the homologation dossier. None of those things were true at any point in the past, especially in 2014. This is by design, the regulations have been crafted to ensure that you can compete as a customer on a level playing field.\n\nAdd to that, Williams and Mclaren made sure that they had access and input to Mercedes PU design in their PU deals, which means that they likely won't have much, if any penalty from being a customer.\n\nIn fact, that could be our best shot at a super close championship in '26. If the Merc is (as expected) the best PU, having 4 teams that could compete at the front is pretty exciting."", ""Mercedes and McLaren negotiated a deal for 2026-onward which gives McLaren a seat at the table in PU design so they have input and always know exactly what's going on with the engine, allowing them to effectively design their car around the PU instead of designing their car then buying the PU afterwards.\n\nThat makes them a pseudo-works team, and yeah, means their status as a customer team shouldn't matter nor hold them back in 2026. TBH this is what the rules should force engine suppliers to do for customer teams they provide their engines to, for the good of the sport.\n\nThe other customer teams as far as I know don't have this benefit and are mostly blind to how their engines will perform relative to the chassis, so they'll probably struggle a bit at the beginning of the regulations."", ""It will be much harder for them than compared to today, where the engine freeze and rules around ICE mode parity make it fairer.\n\nFor the 2026 rules, I believe they've put in some rules to ensure that customer teams get the same engine modes and things like that. The challenge, as you've alluded to, is around cooling and packing. The cooling requirement for the next gen battery is going to be significant. I suspect the manufacturers will have some kind of immediate advantage, albeit smaller than what we saw with the current ones."", 'I think McLaren, a customer team, is a contender until proven otherwise.', 'Red Bull and Mclaren have both won titles as customer cars.', 'The cost cap still exists.']",528,102,2024-10-14 08:29:54, Discussion,13,11

The hunt for the French engineers has already begun. Ferrari, Audi and Red Bull are seizing their chance.\n\nThe unions' fight was ultimately in vain.

In the middle of the year, Alpine had already announced that it wanted to use a customer engine from 2026 and convert the factory in Viry-Châtillon into a technology center. Talks with Mercedes about a new partnership are already well advanced behind the scenes.\n\nAfter it finally became clear at the end of September that there would be no more power units from Renault from 2026, the competition is now rubbing its hands together.

Of course I am just manually looking, so there’s no adjustment for track length or anything.

But i was writing out what they usually are and i noticed something sort of interesting (doesn’t hold any actual importance though)

Charles has out-qualified Carlos by a  margin of 1-0.05 (in terms of a tenth) 6 times with 3 being under .10

And he’s out-qualified him by a margin of over 2 and a quarter tenths 7 times, 4 being over 3 and a half tenths

But he’s never out qualified Carlos within the range of 1 tenth to 2.25.
If you found the average of the usual gap Charles out-qualifies Carlos by it’s probably somewhere between this 2 numbers, but yet he’s never actually been in those numbers.

 You’d think that would be the most common gap, but instead either Charles is dominating or it’s insanely close.

Carlos’s gaps to Charles when he’s out qualified are more normal even with only 6 values.

It does probably hurt Charles if people find their average gap using the median, because their (unadjusted inaccurate just the physical numbers of the gaps) median difference

is +0.37 to Charles
but to the Charles side of that the numbers are 
+.73, +1, +2.25, +2.48, +2.63, + 3.54

and to Carlos side 
+0.08, +0.06, +0.05, -0.06, -1.04, -1.93

Track conditions and characteristics can play to drivers' strengths differently so in the end I really don't think saying x driver smokes y driver on a good day/is more talented etc. means anything\n2.

1g4uik6,The sprint race point allocation needs to be revamped,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g4uik6/the_sprint_race_point_allocation_needs_to_be/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g4uik6/the_sprint_race_point_allocation_needs_to_be/,2024-10-16,0 days,"Sprint races are usually 1/3 of the distance of a normal race, so it would be logical to assume that awarding around 1/3 of the points of a normal race would be the right way to go about things, but this doesn't make sense in the context of a few things:

* The winner hardly gains a point advantage over say the 3rd or 4th, while in the normal race they get around the double their points

* There are only 6 sprint races in 24-25 race calendar year, which automatically makes the logic behind the 1/3 rule fall apart and devalues it further

* There's no real incentive to push 100% when the difference per position is only 1 point apart

* Cars are so reliable these days that the top 8 are almost always firmly locked in place

* FIA wants sprint races to matter, but the risk is not worth the reward with the current point system and infrequency of sprint races

* Smaller teams either get punished or have no chance to score points, since there's way less to gain for them compared to a normal race

* FIA wants sprint races to be their own special event so why do you apply a copy & paste full race logic in terms of rewards to something that works differently

Here's a proposed suggestion to revamp the point system:

>Current point system: 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

>Revamped point system: 20, 15, 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Advantages:

* The winner gets a clear point advantage over the rest

* Points are given to the Top 12

* More incentives to fight for positions

* Top teams and smaller teams are both rewarded more

* Sprint races actually have an effect on the world championship

* Teams are more likely to come up with bold strategies and we get more exciting races since the Top 12 get points now and finishing higher rewards way more points","['Terrible idea', 'Can we please stop proposing ways of making sprint races more significant than they are?\n\nIf we have to have them, I want them to be as inconsequential as possible, ideally.', 'I would revamp them into the bin', 'Woo, another ""my idea to improve sprint races"" post.""', 'Honey, wake up.

I’ll be marshaling at turn 18, right under the tower at the USGP this weekend. 

I’m planning to make the Ferrari boys each their own authentic Texas felt cowboy hat. I’ll be branding them with a Scud. Ferrari emblem on the front, and their respective name/number on the brim. 

The problem is, cowboy hats are extremely finicky when it comes to sizing. I have scraped the internet to no avail, so this is my last resort: does anybody know where I can get a general idea of head dimensions/hat size/anything for Charles/Carlos? My go to guess will be medium ish for Charles (size 7 - 7 1/8) and large ish for Carlos (size 7 1/4 ish) 

Appreciate any help! If you’ll be at COTA, say hi to your friendly neighborhood marshal wearing a straw lid at T18


Edit: I have emailed/DMed SF directly, as well as Carlos and Charles talent managements. No response :( 

Edit 2: everyone saying not to give gifts, idk I think an authentic lid with the Ferrari logo burned into it would be fitting for at least PR reasons. Who knows, if one of them wins, maybe they’ll take it to the podium. Worst case it’s $100 burned and a few hours of my time ","['I’ll be brutally honest, save your money. They’ll no doubt be provided hats for parts of the weekend. You’re already volunteering, and giving up a big part of your time. Enjoy it and save the stress!', 'I love this idea, but coming from someone who has Marshaled before the likelihood of being able to give it to them is slim to none. I would love to see this but I agree with those saying to save your money 😭 I’ve never been able to even get close to a driver marshaling as much as it would be great. Plus it is super long and exhausting days with barely any time for funsies. Make some for yourself and your friends!!', 'Nice try Mr. Sniper', 'Save your time and money brother', ""There not taking it to the podium as they won't be allowed. They have to wear their regulation gear.\n\nPlease save your money you need it more than they do and as much as Liberty like to hype up races as if the world has stopped just for F1.. it is just another day of work in an over packed schedule for all these drivers and teams who will be focused on nothing but their obligations."", 'On the podium I think they must wear the Pirelli sponsored hats :) Hope you figure it out, and have a good weekend!', ""Save your money. They're already contractual obliged to wear specific items of clothing. If they have some wiggle room in their contract, they're likely to fill it with brands they're personally associated with. Wearing anything else is likely to upset sponsors who pay big bucks to be seen being worn by drivers"", ""I do have some vague info for you, stemming from a series of helmet exchanges Seb did. When Seb swapped with George, they tried on each other's helmets, and George couldn't fit Seb's on, and it came out that Seb wore a size small helmet, and George wore size 'large at least' I think was the line. You can find the video. Well, I found a separate picture from Charles's and Seb's helmet exchange, and they could each fit in the other's helmet. It looked like maybe Charles had to shove it on a bit harder, but he did fit fine, unlike George. So... I think your assessment of Charles having smaller to mediumish head for an adult man is accurate. One more tiny data point, Lewis also managed to shove Seb's helmet on. Maybe about like Charles could. So I don't think Seb has like a tiny head, just small, and Charles and Lewis might wear one size up- or maybe two, I don't know how many sizes there are and how much wiggle room there is with helmet padding, though I believe it is pretty stiff padding. Edit: Seb used an Arai helmet, and here's their rough sizing: [https://www.revzilla.com/arai-helmets-size-chart](https://www.revzilla.com/arai-helmets-size-chart) I found a different page with like... too much information about padding thickness options, but this should be a rough estimate.\n\nReference points for Carlos. He did a helmet exchange with Lando, and Carlos's helmet didn't get remotely close to going over Lando's head. Like not even to eye level like Seb's helmet went on George. That helmet just wasn't going anywhere at all, and Carlos did try shoving it, haha. When Lando exchanged with Daniel, Lando managed to shove the helmet on. Daniel clearly had a much easier time getting on Lando's helmet, he showed the wiggle room, but the helmet did fit fully on Lando's head, unlike Carlos's. So... this is not that much of a reference point for Carlos, since I don't have a connection to any sort of resembling concrete size... but I would guess that Carlos has a smallish to maybe mediumish head for an adult man and that if you are estimating large for him, that might be wrong. Unless Lando just has a really massive head, and Daniel has a quite large one.\n\nI do agree with others who say you should save your money and are unlikely to reach them. I do agree that reaching out to trainers like I see you've done is your best chance. I do know that both of them like gifts from fans. Charles wears bracelets from fans, but something as large as a cowboy hat has travel logistics. You can always make them for yourself and a friend, and if you happen to have the opportunity to pass them off, go for it? I realize you might not have a similar size head to our best guesses for them."", ""A rule I have in life is don't give people gifts if they earn more than double what I do.""]",168,60,2024-10-15 16:28:52, Discussion,-1,0

While [Toyota has insisted (repeatedly) that their union with Haas isn’t part of a grander plan to fire up an engine program](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g13obv/racefans_toyota_has_stated_clearly_it_has_no_plan/) or return to F1 as works team, that’s not stopping—and won’t—the rumblings and rumours to the contrary.

*This entry comes with a “slightly off-topic” label:* Michael Andretti, son of Mario (one of only three drivers *ever* to win races in Formula 1, IndyCar, the World Sportscar Championship, and NASCAR), [has stepped down from his day-to-day operations role at Andretti Global.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fyd8zq/ot_an_open_letter_from_michael_andretti_andretti/) While he claims the reason his to spend more time with his family, one can’t help but wonder if the so-far-failed attempt at entering F1 he spearheaded is part of the puzzle.

I'm not saying that's necessarily *the* characteristic of the great drivers, just that some have it and others don't.

Of the recent ones, I would say Schumacher, Alonso and arguably Verstappen have this attitude. They don't do this all the time, but when necessary they do it, and seem reasonably OK with the choice. 

Hamilton, Rosberg and Vettel are capable of this, and have crashed into other people deliberately (or deliberately effected a crash, if you like), but I get the sense that these were out of frustration or anger; they were never in ""control"" of the situation.

My question is: who was the last British champion driver who had that kind of ruthlessness about him? 

I don't think Button had it, nor Hill (despite that threat during Spa '98). Maybe Mansell, but I'm slightly too young to have watched him live, and my abiding image of him is pushing very hard during a race and having his car breakdown one way or another. 

Again, I don't think this is necessarily a desirable quality in a driver, nor does it mean a driver who has it is better or worse than others.","['Heres a surprise.

1g4l9tw,How to invite former F1 drivers/people to podcast?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g4l9tw/how_to_invite_former_f1_driverspeople_to_podcast/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g4l9tw/how_to_invite_former_f1_driverspeople_to_podcast/,2024-10-15,0 days,"Hello, I'm Michał, sport journalist from Poland. I have been involved in sports journalism for years - mainly volleyball, basketball and F1. Over the years of working for various websites, I managed to arrange interviews with many F1 drivers - among others Mario Andretti, Jody Scheckter, Thierry Boutsen, Derek Warwick, Robert Kubica, Nick Fry, Sebastien Buemi, Mario Theissen, Mika Salo. I think that over the years there have been 20+ people related to F1. All of them were published in text form on Polish websites. I suspect that the desire to talk was due to the reach of the sites I worked for, and not because of me personally.



For over a year now, I have been running my podcast (a modest project, 32 podcast episodes so far), in which I have not yet had a guest from F1. Most of them are volleyball and basketball. However, I would like to talk to someone from F1. While I know that it is very difficult to get in touch with people from the current F1 environment, theoretically it should be easier with former drivers, bosses, directors, etc. It should be, but it isn't, because unfortunately I am either ignored or rejected due to my small reach. In many cases I cannot find a contact (I often used IG, FB or websites of drivers or their companies to contact me).



Can anyone advise me on how I can get more F1 contacts or encourage F1 people to join my podcast? Sending links to previous interviews doesn't seem to work. Thanks in advance for your help. Greetings from Poland.","[""PR people are your best bet. but as youve pointed out the reach of the sites that you've worked for is probably more of a factor rather than yourself as a journalist, sorry to be blunt. regretably its a numbers game, current drivers only have so much time in a day and they'll prioritise the outlets that will give them the most reach for publicity \n\ni think youre better off trying to find someone whos not a driver currently, or someone who works/worked in f1 not as a driver. cold calling is probably the way to go if you dont have contacts already. keep talking to as many as you can, get as many people on there as possible, build interest and reach. the people you interview could eventually be a new contact to someone else, who knows. \n\nrandom names i can think of:\n\n- gunther steiner (dude is promoting his book now iirc)\n\n- hanz harald franzer (his kid makes tiktok videos featuring him) - probably butchered his name sorry \n\n- former/current mechanics, other team folk, i dunno maybe a chef... people who dont usually get interviewed and can afford to make time for you. i feel like this is your best bet tbh\n\n- other journalists, you could pitch it as an episode of two journalists talking to each other about your experiences in your respective sport (ie: your experience talking to people in volleyball/basketball)\n\n- i think some photographers might give it a go. jamey price + kym illman are very active on social media. \n\nall the bestttt"", ""What's your budget?"", ""Most relevant F1 people aren't going to want to talk to a podcast unless you:\n\nA.

If you can't offer something tangible then you need to focus on people who aren't well known and who would be open for a chat because they aren't asked to do it very often.\n\nAs for contacting them I'd start sending out messages on twitter or linkedin and see if you get any replies.

--

40.9 **A Competitor may not modify any part on the car or make changes to the set-up of the suspension whilst the car is being held under parc fermé conditions.**

[I can see see at least 3-4 loopholes in that sentence e.g. what if it's not the Competitor making the changes but some physical phenomenon doing it all by itself? What if the part morphs and changes shape by itself and is thus not ""modified"" in any way, as it is doing what it was designed to do? What if you don't modify any part but you ""make changes"" to something that is not the suspension? Clever.]

In the case of a breach of this Article the relevant driver must: 

a)  start the sprint session from the pit lane and follow the procedures prescribed in Article 43.3, if the parc fermé conditions are breached from the start of the qualifying practice session until the car leaves the pit lane for the sprint session; and/or

b) start the race from the pit lane and follow the procedures prescribed in Article 44.2, if the parc fermé conditions are breached from the start of the sprint session until the car leaves the pit lane for the race. 

[Blah penalties blah]

**In order that the scrutineers may be completely satisfied that no alterations have been made to the suspension systems or aerodynamic configuration of the car (with the exception of the front wing) whilst in pre-race parc fermé, it must be clear from physical inspection that changes cannot be made without the use of tools.**

[Several loopholes in that language, e.g. it says nothing about the non-aero, non-suspension parts being changed without tools... Also says nothing about anything other than physical inspections of aero and suspension, so that leaves a lot wide open... Very clever. I actually like this a lot, exploiting as-yet unexploited loopholes in the SRs rather than the TRs. Somebody deserves a raise.]

The Finn is waiting for Sauber/Audi's decision and is also preparing to not have a cockpit next year\n\n(Motorsport-Total.com) - Who will be in the Sauber cockpit in 2025? Even before this weekend's US Grand Prix in Austin (Texas), the driver question for next year is still unresolved. Even Valtteri Bottas, who is actually considered a hot candidate, seems to be increasingly preoccupied with this - and above all unsettled!\n\nValtteri Bottas is waiting for the decision from Sauber/Audi\n\n‘I had said that I hoped everything would be sorted out by Austin, but I'm still waiting for the final decisions,’ said Bottas, who apparently can't explain why he doesn't yet have a contract for next year in his pocket. ‘I think Mattia \\[Binotto, team principal\\] should answer that question rather than me.’\n\n‘It's out of my hands,’ says the Finn, who “can't do anything at the moment” except wait and see. ‘Of course, I'm trying to do my best this week and hope that lifts the mood. That's the state of things. We've been in contact every week. I know the conditions I'm getting into and I'm just waiting for the green light.’\n\nBottas: ‘There is a risk of not having a cockpit’\n\nThe Sauber driver was unable to say how long the decision would take on Thursday ahead of the US GP. ‘A month ago, we were told as soon as possible,’ recalls Bottas, who will “hopefully soon” receive an answer regarding his future in Formula 1. ‘Of course, there will also be a deadline from my side at some point.’\n\nThe big question: Who will be in the Sauber cockpit in 2025?\n\nIf the 240-time GP starter wants to look outside Formula 1 or take on another role in the premier class, he should make a decision in the coming weeks. ‘Christmas is coming soon, and there will be no vacancies anywhere,’ warns the otherwise relaxed Finn.\n\nBottas, who has been driving in Formula 1 since 2013 and has celebrated ten Grand Prix victories to date, is therefore also worried that he will no longer have a cockpit next year. ‘In the situation I'm in now, with only one free seat, there is of course a risk,’ admits the 35-year-old honestly.\n\nMoney ‘shouldn't be the problem’\n\nHowever, Bottas rules out the possibility that it could be down to him asking for too much money, for example, because ‘that shouldn't be an issue. I think the conditions we are talking about are as they should be and I think Audi should have the budget, at least that's what they say. So I don't think that should be a problem.’\n\nAfter all, he has ‘already built up a good relationship with Mattia’ and talked about both his future and the plans for 2025. ‘I've been told everything so far,’ reveals the current Sauber driver, who also knows that Sauber/Audi has other options for 2025.\n\n‘I love Formula 1 and I want to drive in Formula 1. It's obviously a bit of a strange situation, but that's the way it is,’ explains Bottas, who has “had a lot of time to think about different things over the past three weeks, but is always positive”.\n\nValtteri Bottas ‘remains positive’\n\n‘I will remain positive,’ says the Finn, who says there is not much more he can do than perform on the track and continue to work on success with the team. However, this is not easy, because ‘if you don't have the car, it's really difficult to show what you can do’.\n\n‘And the people who make decisions also tend to look at the results,’ fears the 35-year-old. ‘It's not easy to shine at the moment, but I just have to trust Mattia. I just have to trust that he knows what he's getting from me.’\n\n‘I feel and believe that I should have this cockpit and that it's the best thing for the team,’ says Bottas optimistically ahead of the Grand Prix in Austin.

This includes a reorganisation of the way the regulations are laid out, which will be divided into thematic sections for clarity and consistency. The transition to the new structure will be concluded in the next few months.\n \n>The 2026 Technical Regulations (Section C), originally approved in June 2024, were subject to extensive enhancements to the aerodynamic regulations, which have been the subject of a strong collaboration between the FIA, FOM and the Formula 1 teams. This will see a higher performance from the cars, while maintaining management of the wake characteristics to promote close and exciting racing.\n \n>The 2026 Sporting Regulations (Section B) have undergone a significant update in order to simplify and modernise their structure. They have introduced measures to regulate the energy management of the Power Units as well as the management of the adjustable aerodynamics, which will involve the deployment of the “straight-line mode” (low drag) and the “cornering mode” (high downforce). In addition, there will be three pre-season tests of three days each for the 2026 season to account for the new power units that will be adopted.\n \n>The 2026 Financial Regulations (Section D) have built on the experience gained by the FIA, Formula 1 and the teams since the first introduction of Financial Regulations in 2021. Significant effort has been made to simplify the regulations by changes in the perimeter of exclusions and adjustment methodologies and to strengthen measures available to FIA to monitor compliance to the Financial Regulations. The overall level of the cost cap has remained – in effect – equivalent to the current levels, while the changes to the actual number reflect the changes to exclusion and adjustment perimeter and the effect of cumulative inflation.\n \n> Further elements will be submitted to the World Council for approval in the coming months to complete the regulation package for 2026, while refinements to the already approved sections will continue with the collaboration between the FIA, FOM and the Formula 1 teams.\n\n>**Regulatory updates**          \n>**FIA Formula One World Championship**\n \n>Minor changes for 2024 and 2025 Sporting and Technical regulations were approved by the World Council, including the removal of the point awarded for setting the fastest lap and the increase in requirement for fielding a young driver during free practice from once per season to two times per season.', 'Doesn’t this say that teams will have to do four rookie practice sessions next year, not remove the requirement completely like people were reporting earlier?', ""It looks like somebody messed up when they tweeted about the rookie sessions.

I pulled a few different regulatory eras and tried to look at the third year of relatively stable rules, like we have now (except 2012, when I just went for the competitive 4th season).

I looked at number of winning cars and drivers, gap between the top 3 in the WDC (percentage of leaders points P3 has) and the gap between the entire field in qualifying. (I excluded any obviously erroneous results such as vastly different weather between Q1 and Q3 or cars multiple seconds away from the pack). **All data was taken for first 16 races only to make it measurable between seasons.**

|Era/Year|# Winning Teams|#Winning Drivers|Gap Between Top 3|Gap Between 1st and last Quali|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Ground Effect - 2024|4|7|72%|2.45s|
|V6 Turbo - 2016|2|4|71%|4.68s|
|KERS - 2012|4|7|78%|6.14s|
|3l V10 - 2002|3|4|35%|4.94s|
|No Driver Aids - 1996|3|4|61%|6.57s|
|Ground Effect Ban - 1986|4|5|96%|10.56s|

This season looks to be up there on all metrics apart from gap between the top 3 in the table at this stage of the season.

But what is staggering is how tight the whole field is compared to any other era, I saw some people calling Sauber ""a joke"" in another thread and this proves just how good of a job Sauber are doing compared to backmarkers of yore. The gap between P20 and P1 in Bahrain this year would have put you 6th on the grid in 1986's opener.","[""Sauber being a joke is definitely relative. They're a joke because week after week, even though their qualifying time is less than 2 seconds.

But now when every car can pull something off and are only really separated by consistency of race pace. \n\nSauber still can't manage to score a single point."", ""I'd love to see F1 with Stable rules, and have the drivers race around the track on horseback"", ""But that isn't being a joke.\n\nThat is being worst of a historically very strong field (probably the strongest of all time).\n\nThey are far from a joke."", 'Charles would fall off immediately.  😂😂', ""Sauber always finding itself in the back half of the grid in an era where finishing exactly in the middle gets you a point is of course concerning. But the fact that they're able to finish races and don't trigger the 107% rule on their own makes them a step up compared to the backmarkers of yore."", 'I don\'t know. Sure. If you look at performance on lap time or race time, Sauber is undeniably better than say Minardi, or Caterham, or Super Aguri.\n\nBut let\'s take it to an example (that I know about sorry if it loses you) in competitive Smash Brothers tournaments. What\'s a worse fate. Going to a super major (an event where the best players in the world attend) and coming dead last. Where at least you can say ""well, I never had a chance anyway, these are the best players in the world after all"" \n\nOr going to a local (where the competition is much lower and in line with your average joe) And still coming dead last.\n\n(yes, I know right now 3 of the best drivers possibly of all time are competing but they\'re teams are undeniably held back by regulations and cost caps)', ""But that analogy doesn't work. Your analogy compares modern F1 to a local championship. The level is undeniably higher than previous eras in terms of teams.\n\nThere is no way you could watch F1 in the 80s/90s and tell me the level of the sport was higher than now. \n\nThey are both going to Super Majors, but the older teams are getting wiped out in seconds without landing a hit and Sauber are lasting a few rounds and landing a few hits without getting any wins."", ""I'm more arguing that the teams are being held back so much and Sauber is still comfortably last.\n\nJust remember, Haas is spending more now than they did in 2019. While Ferrari is spending a third of what they once did. \n\nImagine how far gone the top teams would be right now if they didn't have that budget cap.""]",0,9,2024-10-18 08:29:28, Statistics,0,0

They give a point for fastest lap, which is often won in rather shambolic circumstances.

In my opinion, if the race winner gets 25 points then pole position should get around 5-10 points, the actual number could be up for debate.

I also think it should just be pole position that gets
Points for qualifying.

Thoughts?","['Likely because it would be the same ~3 cars getting the points over and over. Some teams would never be able to get these points, whereas the fastest lap could mean a lot to a team that gets 10th place every so often. \n\nThis would just widen the gap between the big teams and the smaller ones.

Much more fine than with fastest lap- which is allegedly going away next year. But I wouldn’t support it being worth more than 1-3 points.

What if, for exemple, Verstappen (1st) and Norris (2nd) went to the final round with 8 points between then. 

Fast foward to the three last laps, and Norris is winning with the fastest lap (26 points), while Verstappen is second (17 points) and Perez third.

Up until that moment, Norris would win by one point.

Then, Red Bull call Perez in to get fresh rubber. The mexican fall off the Top 5 (hell, if there was a Safety Car during the race, he could even get out of the Top 10).

And then, on the last lap, while everybody thought that Norris won, Perez set the Fastest Lap, take away Lando's extra point and Verstappen wins the championship in a tie-breaker 'cause he had more wins.

Even if McLaren noticed it, what would they do? If Norris is within 20s of Verstappen, they wouldn't pit him. They only thing they could do, more thay praying, is to send out Piastri to block Perez.
