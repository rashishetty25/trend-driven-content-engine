1g2i75w,Prema struggles logic ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g2i75w/prema_struggles_logic/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g2i75w/prema_struggles_logic/,2024-10-13,0 days,"Prema has been regarded as the best F3/F2 team to be in up untill this year. In 2024 Prema  isn't as good and it has been generally accepted opinion that because of Prema struggles their drivers who both got promoted to F1 can't show their true potential. Reasoning behind their promotions is for Antonelli: impressive F4 and FRECA career and beating Bearman. For Bearman is his P3 as a rookie in F3 and P6 as a rookie in F2 last year and his Jeddah stint for now he is 13th in F2 standings.
I have genuine questions about ""Prema is shit argument"".

- Firstly F2 is supposed to have equal cars so weren't people upset with Prema being the best or one of the best team in recent years as it gives some drivers with usually more money an unfair advantage? Like right now some people seem almost annoyed that Prema is not as good as last year. It literally means that their drivers don't have an advantage over others anymore. And imo Prema is still like in top 5 teams.

I must say it but both current Prema drivers has been talked as a 'next F1 stars' and has been fan favourites long before this year. Antonelli's hype as a next Merc driver started after he won F4s and FRECA and Bearman was already reserve driver for Ferrari this year. Also it is not hard to notice that both Kimi and Ollie come from very wealthy families and have connections (especially Kimi's dad). With Prema past reputation I can somewhat see it as a golden ticket in feeder series only for the most priviliged.

- Second question: If we accept ""because of Prema struggles drivers can't show their full  potential"" logic. We should also acknowledge that in the past Prema drivers could look better than they really were but nobody is using this logic in reverse. Bearman accomplished P3 in F3 and P6 in F2 with Prema when they were arguably one of the best teams. Why everybody put all the blame on Prema for Bearman poor performance (plus a bit of bad luck) this year but nobody  acknowleges that he had some team advantage in 2022 and 2023 which could influence his standings? ","[""Prema drivers generally have high budget. High budget drivers have new chassis and parts whenever they need them, which is always an advantage over drivers with three or more year old chassis cobbled together with repaired parts. (Of course, there are high budget drivers on other teams too.) This year, however, everyone started F2 with a fresh, brand new chassis. So that part is equal. This year in F2 they also couldn't rely on data that the drivers the years before gathered, so it was all on current drivers and current engineers. And Bearman clearly had his head and heart in F1 for the whole year, and F2 was an afterthought. And Antonelli split some of his time too. Driving multiple vehicles is difficult. It really doesn't help when the more experienced driver has quite possibly had an F1 contract all year and known that F2 was a formality for extra track time."", '>I have genuine questions about ""Prema is shit argument"".\n\nIf you look at all of their results in all of the series that they participate in and have participated in, Formula 2 is one of their worst series. Their reputation is built on success in the lower tiers of the support categories. And it\'s not just a 2024 problem, either -- they are wildly inconsistent. Look at their 2019 season, when they finished *ninth* overall. In eight years of Formula 2, they\'ve won the teams\' championship twice and finished second twice. Compare that to six years for Formula 3, where they have won the teams\' championship five times and finished second in the other. Or six years in Formula Regional Europe, where they have five teams\' titles and one third place. Or eleven years of Italian Formula 4, where they have eight teams\' titles and three second places.', ""Literally everyone who follows the feeder series uses this logic in reverse. Look back at any threads regarding Mick's junior career."", 'People interpret things the way they want to with their bias. \n\nIf driver they like wins it’s their skill and incredibleness. If driver they like is doing badly it’s the team. \n\nIf driver they like is in a fast car, it’s because of his technical knowledge and set up knowledge helping push the team forward. If a driver they like is in a bad car, it’s because they team  don’t know how to develop or set up their car. \n\nIf a driver they like is rude and loud it’s because he has personality and is a character which is missing from PR drilled drivers these days. If it’s a driver you hate doing the same thing, he’s just rude and disrespectful.', ""So because it was a new regulations/car change for f2, some teams got new set ups right immediately and some teams didn't. Just because the cars are more equal does not mean that set up does not matter. Prema got it wrong and it remained wrong for much of the first half of the season and thus their drivers really did not have a shot. Think of it like aston martin that one year where they got it right and were getting podiums and then boom they got it wrong and were suddenly nowhere again. That happens in Motor sport. \n\nIn Ollie's case people give him the benefit of the doubt not only because he has proved not once but twice now that he can succeed in an f1 car but also because he was flat out good last year. He got literally everything you can get in baku last year including pole lap with a broken steering column so his steering wheel wasn't straight. Two things could have happened from last year to this year one he suddenly fell off considerably (which we know is not true from his f1 performances) or two prema fell off hard which is what fans have decided is true and clearly the teams agree to based on his and kimi's promotions. \n\nPrema should have been a team capable of fighting for the championship this year but they aren't they got their act together way to late this year (and in ollie's case it doesn't help for his f2 campaign that he got pulled from two of his best tracks including one of the few early races prema looked decent in and that he had a pole for) making a title run basically impossible so then you judge the drivers based on what they can get out of the car. Its like f1 no one is saying that a williams driver should be regularly winning races the car is just not there so they don't expect it. Prema is a midfield team this year and expectations seem to have been adjusted accordingly.\n\nAs for Ollie taking F2 less seriously, overall pretty much knew from the start of the year he was being promoted. He had 6 FP1s with Haas scheduled BEFORE he got the call up in Jeddah. You don't get 6 FPs announced at a single team and a single team that is NOT your driver academy's team at the very beginning of the year unless you are getting the seat. Then Jeddah happened and I am pretty sure he was told to no longer worry about placing super high in F2...which is fair considering he just had a pole and likely a pretty high finish taken away from him he lost a full weekend of points which with only 14 weekends creates a pretty difficult gap to close AND he just proved he could race in F1 on one of the hardest tracks of the year which honestly is worth more to teams than a good f2 showing because nothing proves you can drive in f1 like driving in f1. So even if it was not announced until his future home race at silverstone Ollie was almost certainly given the handshake that he was getting the seat after Jeddah. And once you have the seat your focus turns to how to best prep for f1 which includes doing your best in fps even if it compromises your f2 races. \n\nTLDR: Either Prema shit the bed this year and thus the results are not representative of the drivers or two very talented drivers forgot how to drive this year and in ollie's case we know the second is not true so it has to be the first and people are acting accordingly. People are judging Ollie off all the info available which includes his f1 stints. Is that unfair to other drivers who didn't get the chance? Maybe but luck already plays a huge role in who gets promoted. You can be super talented but if the right affiliated seat does not appear at the right time your screwed. Like Colapinto and Lawson no one was really singing their praises that they were worthy of getting a seat until they got a shot and proved they were worthy that is just how things go and Ollie probably didn't need that shot based on the number of fp1s he was already scheduled for even before Carlos' appendix decided to bounce."", 'For me it\'s all purely bias anyways. There\'s always pre-determimed favourites and if they don\'t perform as expected there\'s excuses. When a driver nobody is talking about suddenly does good, it\'s because they just inherited a rocketship. Really we can only make educated guesses.\n\nReality is we don\'t know who the best driver is because all the teams come with varying degrees of performance and we just dont know who is really doing the best job there.  This has always been the case and is a problem that goes all the way down to Karting. The rich drivers can pay for the best machinery and pay for extra testing, that makes discovering raw talent tough because the wealthier guys will always have an unfair advatange. So, for all we know the best driver in F2 could be someone in one of the underperforming teams that nobody is talking about, trying to get by on a budget. Colapinto for example was on nobodies radar until a chance drive with Williams, very likely nobody would ever be raving about him had he not been given that chance. He\'d just be seen as another ""mid"" F2 driver with no excuses to back him up, because he wasn\'t one of the pre-season favourites.\n\nPeople will say the teams have the data so know what they\'re doing. However, honestly have to question that sometimes. Its not like the teams can see what every driver is doing in detial andsee how their teams are performing. They only really know the drivers they have under them and even at that, they sometimes can make the wrong decision(Sargeant or De Vries as recent examples). Like at one point Ferrari had all the data on Antonelli in Karting but turned him down from their academy. So what did Mercedes see in Kimi that Ferrari did not? If he\'s such a star, why did Ferrari not want to back a hyper talented Italian driver. Sometimes got to question what the conditions are for making these academies. Like what constitutes performance/talent for them?', 'Also how many drivers drove for teams other than Prema in previous years and never got a F1 seat because they never looked good, despite the fact they were potentially maximising the cars potential but still fell behind behind Prema drivers who were not.', 'Overall I agree apart from Bearman argument that he had his head already in F1 from the beginning of the year. I get his Jeddah stint and FPs with Haas but other than that he had no reasons not to be focused on F2. It could only be remotely possible if he literally had his contract signed after Jeddah or somehow knew he is getting F1 seat no matter the results. And imo intentionally not focusing on your F2 career while it is his job for 2024 and there are many drivers dreaming to be in his position comes across as a bit disrespectful and entilted. That\'s why I am not buying this ""excuse"".', 'I argue totally different with Mick.\n\nAlthough he won the F2 title, he did it in about the least impressive way, being on average the 6th fastest driver in races.\n\nNothing about the team, the driver was lacklustre in winning rhe title.']",0,17,2024-10-13 18:42:06, Discussion,0,0

The Key Points was the new Rules are too complex, Engine too reliant on Chassis design and reloading the Battery. Customers Team will get the Engines Layout way too late and will be compromised alot. 

They also talked this with Fred Vasseur about this and he confirmed that customers Team won't have a Chance in the new Rules. Renault Vyril PU Engineers also this to Renault CEO.

Aston Martin knew this from the beginning and signed with Honda.

So what option does McLaren have now? 



","['I’m pretty sure that part of the deal to keep McLaren at Mercedes was that they get to be in the room when the engine is being developed. The threat from RBPT was that big at the time that Mercedes gave away the advantage they would have had over McLaren.\n\nEDIT: [here’s an article about it.](https://speedcafe.com/mclaren-influence-mercedes-engine-development-2026/)', ""So generally this has been common wisdom in F1 and why generally the top 3-4 teams will always be a works team and why that is a very coveted seat to fill.\n\nIt's why the McHonda disaster happened in the first place and why RB-Renault relations have always been strained especially since Renault re-entered the sport (and subsequently flopped hard in the hybrid era).\n\nHOWEVER, teams are not nearly secretive as before and particularly Mercedes have had better collaboration with customers than you would see historically from engine manufacturers. secondly, the FIA during the early days of the hybrid era has slammed down on special engine maps only available to works teams i.e 'Party Mode' and we will expect to see parity from the software side now too.\n\nIt does however limit designers especially people like Newey who design the car wholistically and would like to have a say on engine dimensions/packaging to suit his Aero needs. On this part customer teams have their hands tied a bit.\n\nIt's not a silver bullet tho and imo short term customer teams with good engines will have better luck than works teams with bad engines."", 'No\n\nMcLaren will be a VIP customer (or customer with some advantages in the engine development process) so they could be like Force India or Williams in 2014-16 (with better economics).', ""Absolutely! Things are always up in the air when it comes to new regulations, but this should be the most level playing field during a regulations change in F1 history.\n\n7 teams will have similar facilities, workforces and be running at the cost cap. The manufactrers PU development is being done under a cost cap and there are strict regulations regarding supply parity, engine modes, mounting points and dissemination of information through the homologation dossier. None of those things were true at any point in the past, especially in 2014. This is by design, the regulations have been crafted to ensure that you can compete as a customer on a level playing field.\n\nAdd to that, Williams and Mclaren made sure that they had access and input to Mercedes PU design in their PU deals, which means that they likely won't have much, if any penalty from being a customer.\n\nIn fact, that could be our best shot at a super close championship in '26. If the Merc is (as expected) the best PU, having 4 teams that could compete at the front is pretty exciting."", ""Mercedes and McLaren negotiated a deal for 2026-onward which gives McLaren a seat at the table in PU design so they have input and always know exactly what's going on with the engine, allowing them to effectively design their car around the PU instead of designing their car then buying the PU afterwards.\n\nThat makes them a pseudo-works team, and yeah, means their status as a customer team shouldn't matter nor hold them back in 2026. TBH this is what the rules should force engine suppliers to do for customer teams they provide their engines to, for the good of the sport.\n\nThe other customer teams as far as I know don't have this benefit and are mostly blind to how their engines will perform relative to the chassis, so they'll probably struggle a bit at the beginning of the regulations."", ""It will be much harder for them than compared to today, where the engine freeze and rules around ICE mode parity make it fairer.\n\nFor the 2026 rules, I believe they've put in some rules to ensure that customer teams get the same engine modes and things like that. The challenge, as you've alluded to, is around cooling and packing. The cooling requirement for the next gen battery is going to be significant. I suspect the manufacturers will have some kind of immediate advantage, albeit smaller than what we saw with the current ones."", 'I think McLaren, a customer team, is a contender until proven otherwise.', 'Red Bull and Mclaren have both won titles as customer cars.', 'The cost cap still exists.']",528,102,2024-10-14 08:29:54, Discussion,13,11

Of course I am just manually looking, so there’s no adjustment for track length or anything.

But i was writing out what they usually are and i noticed something sort of interesting (doesn’t hold any actual importance though)

Charles has out-qualified Carlos by a  margin of 1-0.05 (in terms of a tenth) 6 times with 3 being under .10

And he’s out-qualified him by a margin of over 2 and a quarter tenths 7 times, 4 being over 3 and a half tenths

But he’s never out qualified Carlos within the range of 1 tenth to 2.25.
If you found the average of the usual gap Charles out-qualifies Carlos by it’s probably somewhere between this 2 numbers, but yet he’s never actually been in those numbers.

 You’d think that would be the most common gap, but instead either Charles is dominating or it’s insanely close.

Carlos’s gaps to Charles when he’s out qualified are more normal even with only 6 values.

It does probably hurt Charles if people find their average gap using the median, because their (unadjusted inaccurate just the physical numbers of the gaps) median difference

is +0.37 to Charles
but to the Charles side of that the numbers are 
+.73, +1, +2.25, +2.48, +2.63, + 3.54

and to Carlos side 
+0.08, +0.06, +0.05, -0.06, -1.04, -1.93

I just thought it was interesting how many times Charles and Carlos were neck and neck in qualifying and also how many times Carlos wasn’t really close at all and yet there was somehow never a middle ground between that ","[""If Sainz is on his best and Leclerc is not, they're very close, and Carlos can eek out a win.

The problem lies with the fact that Leclerc is also having one of the best seasons of his career."", 'For me, quali of SF-24 is hard to judge. Because it is a mediocre one in quali with significant tires warm-up issues. Btw, IMO Carlos may occasionally choose quali-preferred set-up a little bit or Charles may sometimes choose race-preferred set-up slightly. Because their race pace differences are bigger than the quali.(And IMO Carlos was not that type of guy who was significant faster on Saturday than Sunday before he joined Ferrari.) But it is just my guessing, no evidence to prove and I can be completely wrong lol.', 'Someone did a calculation of their average gap across their time as teammates and and it’s stayed [pretty consistent](https://x.com/formulaur_/status/1840076080926929202?s=46) across the years, near 0.130-0.150% favoring Leclerc.', 'In….checks notes…. six races, we aren’t going to have to discuss this any more, are we?  /s \n\n😀', 'Be interesting to see the Lewis Charles gap once Lewis has settled in of course. Actually, considering Leclerc is acknowledged to be one of the very best qualifiers the  gap with Carlos is closer than I thought it would be.', ""In a very general sense, when the car is suited to Charles, he's significantly quicker than Carlos.\n\nWhen the car isn't suited to Charles, it's extremely close."", 'I think it\'s because these cars are so temperamental, and Leclerc is more than likely going to be quicker in quali.\n\nGeorge and Lewis are seeing similar results. Everyone is like ""Lewis is getting obliterated in quali"" and he is, but it\'s by literal hundredths of a second on average.\n\nSometimes it\'ll jump to 1-2 tenths when he struggles with the tyres, but normally they\'re incredibly close, George is just getting that last few hundredths which keeps making it look like he\'s just demolishing him. \n\nPlus the top 7 are normally so close, if you\'re 1 tenth off your teammate, you\'re dropping 5-6 positions from where he\'s starting, so it makes the difference in quali look even worse.', ""1. Track conditions and characteristics can play to drivers' strengths differently so in the end I really don't think saying x driver smokes y driver on a good day/is more talented etc. means anything\n2. Your gap of 1-2.5 tenths is quite arbitrary. Thinking this range of gaps is common is based on a surface level observation. Could be true, but the severity of the gaps are not consistent. 3 tenths in Monza is usually thought to be quite bad compared to on other tracks.\n\n>I just thought it was interesting how many times Charles and Carlos were neck and neck in qualifying and also how many times Carlos wasn’t really close at all\n\nThat said, this is what I feel happened in 2021, Sainz's first season and 2022, when Sainz struggled in the first part of the season."", ""> Of course I am just manually looking, so there’s no adjustment for track length or anything.\n\n> But he’s never out qualified Carlos within the range of 1 tenth to 2.25.

If a car relies less on clean flow to generate downforce, it also becomes less affected by dirty air. \n\nSo while dirty air doesn\'t necessarily get reduced with the introduction of a fan, it makes dirty air less of an issue.

The hunt for the French engineers has already begun. Ferrari, Audi and Red Bull are seizing their chance.\n\nThe unions' fight was ultimately in vain. On September 30, Alpine's parent company Renault confirmed the end of its own engine production in Viry-Châtillon. In the middle of the year, Alpine had already announced that it wanted to use a customer engine from 2026 and convert the factory in Viry-Châtillon into a technology center. Talks with Mercedes about a new partnership are already well advanced behind the scenes.\n\nAfter it finally became clear at the end of September that there would be no more power units from Renault from 2026, the competition is now rubbing its hands together. Ferrari in particular did not hesitate for long. According to information from auto motor und sport, a few dozen engine engineers from Viry-Châtillon have already held job interviews with Ferrari. By hiring high-ranking Renault technicians, Ferrari could buy itself a decisive advantage.\n\nOn the one hand, the Scuderia would gain valuable knowledge, as a prototype for the new engine regulations from 2026 has already been running on the test bench at Renault since June of this year. And on the other hand, Ferrari would weaken its direct competition because the know-how of Renault engineers would not be passed on to its direct competitors."", 'Things about to get Viry spicy.', ""A lot of people are questioning why other teams want Renault's engineers just bc they have the weakest PU on the grid rn. While that might be true now, it might not be the case for 2026.\n\nIt's still valuable to have your competitor's engineers on your staff. They can tell you about the direction and ideas that your competitors went down and what was promising or wasn't. There might be some diamonds in the rough. Let's not forget that Brawn's double diffuser idea came in part from Super Aguri which was dogwater.\n\nAlso, just because the end result isn't good, doesn't mean that the staff aren't good themselves. Success in F1 doesn't just come down to the people you have. Case in point is James Allison worked for Ferrari in 2014 and produced the F14T, yet he went to Mercedes and produced the W11."", 'people in this thread are just kids or completely ignorant.\n\nF1 PU engineers is such a niche market, so being able to hire tens of people with experience is incredibly valuable.\n\nAlso, issues with Renault PUs have to do with not enough funding, it is not a case of lack of talent', 'Me hoping for a surprise announcement that Cadillac has bought out the IP and personnel for their engine program.....', 'Give or take I assume it’s for their best engineers and not everyone will have a job once renault PU shuts down.', ""Red Bull has no shame after talking shit about Renault's engines. 😂"", 'Alpine for better times.']",461,45,2024-10-14 20:24:56, News,3,2

1g3slsg,Ferrari Drivers Head Sizes,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g3slsg/ferrari_drivers_head_sizes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g3slsg/ferrari_drivers_head_sizes/,2024-10-14,0 days,"Howdy,

I’ll be marshaling at turn 18, right under the tower at the USGP this weekend. 

I’m planning to make the Ferrari boys each their own authentic Texas felt cowboy hat. I’ll be branding them with a Scud. Ferrari emblem on the front, and their respective name/number on the brim. 

The problem is, cowboy hats are extremely finicky when it comes to sizing. I have scraped the internet to no avail, so this is my last resort: does anybody know where I can get a general idea of head dimensions/hat size/anything for Charles/Carlos? My go to guess will be medium ish for Charles (size 7 - 7 1/8) and large ish for Carlos (size 7 1/4 ish) 

Appreciate any help! If you’ll be at COTA, say hi to your friendly neighborhood marshal wearing a straw lid at T18


Edit: I have emailed/DMed SF directly, as well as Carlos and Charles talent managements. No response :( 

Edit 2: everyone saying not to give gifts, idk I think an authentic lid with the Ferrari logo burned into it would be fitting for at least PR reasons. Who knows, if one of them wins, maybe they’ll take it to the podium. Worst case it’s $100 burned and a few hours of my time ","['I’ll be brutally honest, save your money. They’ll no doubt be provided hats for parts of the weekend. You’re already volunteering, and giving up a big part of your time. Enjoy it and save the stress!', 'I love this idea, but coming from someone who has Marshaled before the likelihood of being able to give it to them is slim to none. I would love to see this but I agree with those saying to save your money 😭 I’ve never been able to even get close to a driver marshaling as much as it would be great. Plus it is super long and exhausting days with barely any time for funsies. Make some for yourself and your friends!!', 'Nice try Mr. Sniper', 'Save your time and money brother', ""There not taking it to the podium as they won't be allowed. They have to wear their regulation gear.\n\nPlease save your money you need it more than they do and as much as Liberty like to hype up races as if the world has stopped just for F1.. it is just another day of work in an over packed schedule for all these drivers and teams who will be focused on nothing but their obligations."", 'On the podium I think they must wear the Pirelli sponsored hats :) Hope you figure it out, and have a good weekend!', ""Save your money. They're already contractual obliged to wear specific items of clothing. If they have some wiggle room in their contract, they're likely to fill it with brands they're personally associated with. Wearing anything else is likely to upset sponsors who pay big bucks to be seen being worn by drivers"", ""I do have some vague info for you, stemming from a series of helmet exchanges Seb did. When Seb swapped with George, they tried on each other's helmets, and George couldn't fit Seb's on, and it came out that Seb wore a size small helmet, and George wore size 'large at least' I think was the line. You can find the video. Well, I found a separate picture from Charles's and Seb's helmet exchange, and they could each fit in the other's helmet. It looked like maybe Charles had to shove it on a bit harder, but he did fit fine, unlike George. So... I think your assessment of Charles having smaller to mediumish head for an adult man is accurate. One more tiny data point, Lewis also managed to shove Seb's helmet on. Maybe about like Charles could. So I don't think Seb has like a tiny head, just small, and Charles and Lewis might wear one size up- or maybe two, I don't know how many sizes there are and how much wiggle room there is with helmet padding, though I believe it is pretty stiff padding. Edit: Seb used an Arai helmet, and here's their rough sizing: [https://www.revzilla.com/arai-helmets-size-chart](https://www.revzilla.com/arai-helmets-size-chart) I found a different page with like... too much information about padding thickness options, but this should be a rough estimate.\n\nReference points for Carlos. He did a helmet exchange with Lando, and Carlos's helmet didn't get remotely close to going over Lando's head. Like not even to eye level like Seb's helmet went on George. That helmet just wasn't going anywhere at all, and Carlos did try shoving it, haha. When Lando exchanged with Daniel, Lando managed to shove the helmet on. Daniel clearly had a much easier time getting on Lando's helmet, he showed the wiggle room, but the helmet did fit fully on Lando's head, unlike Carlos's. So... this is not that much of a reference point for Carlos, since I don't have a connection to any sort of resembling concrete size... but I would guess that Carlos has a smallish to maybe mediumish head for an adult man and that if you are estimating large for him, that might be wrong. Unless Lando just has a really massive head, and Daniel has a quite large one.\n\nI do agree with others who say you should save your money and are unlikely to reach them. I do agree that reaching out to trainers like I see you've done is your best chance. I do know that both of them like gifts from fans. Charles wears bracelets from fans, but something as large as a cowboy hat has travel logistics. You can always make them for yourself and a friend, and if you happen to have the opportunity to pass them off, go for it? I realize you might not have a similar size head to our best guesses for them."", ""A rule I have in life is don't give people gifts if they earn more than double what I do.""]",168,60,2024-10-15 16:28:52, Discussion,-1,0

# The Drivers’ Mutterings & Mumblings

*In the absence of any meaningful rumblings and rumours this week…* 

[Alex Albono says he welcomes the challenge of Carlos Sainz at Williams next year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fyw937/formula_1_alex_albon_says_he_will_welcome_carlos/) To be fair though, what else was he going to say? Naturally, [Williams are also backing Mr. Albono to match Señor Sainz behind the wheel in 2025.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0lfk7/williams_backs_brilliant_alex_albon_to_match/)

And at long last…

2022 F2 Champion-turned-Aston Martin Test & Reserve Driver [Felipe Drugovich will drive the AMR24 during FP1 in Mexico](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fzrscx/aston_martin_test_and_reserve_driver_felipe/)—his first ever outing in the car he’s been extensively involved in the development of. I must say, I do hope he gets a chance to show his stuff during an F1 race one day.

For a dose of current F2 driver news, former Red Bull Junior and 2021 rookie F3 Champion [Dennis Hauger rejected an offer from an unnamed F2 team (for what would be his fourth season in the series) to try his luck in Indy NXT](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g2anhv/otviaplay_motor_pod_dennis_hauger_has_rejected_an/) (the feeder series for IndyCar) in 2025.

# The Teams’ Twistings & Turnings

There were whispers about this ‘lil diddy around Suzuka time, which faded almost as soon as the paddock left the track. So while this came out of the blue amidst Summer Break #2, [Haas entering a technical partnership with Toyota Gazoo Racing](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g16kv4/haas_f1_team_sporting_a_new_look_on_the_vf24_we/) isn’t a complete surprise—and *is* a big deal. Haas sure has come a long, long way from getting left high and dry by Rich Energy.

While [Toyota has insisted (repeatedly) that their union with Haas isn’t part of a grander plan to fire up an engine program](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g13obv/racefans_toyota_has_stated_clearly_it_has_no_plan/) or return to F1 as works team, that’s not stopping—and won’t—the rumblings and rumours to the contrary.

*This entry comes with a “slightly off-topic” label:* Michael Andretti, son of Mario (one of only three drivers *ever* to win races in Formula 1, IndyCar, the World Sportscar Championship, and NASCAR), [has stepped down from his day-to-day operations role at Andretti Global.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fyd8zq/ot_an_open_letter_from_michael_andretti_andretti/) While he claims the reason his to spend more time with his family, one can’t help but wonder if the so-far-failed attempt at entering F1 he spearheaded is part of the puzzle.

Relatedly, [General Motors hasn’t abandoned joining the grid with their Cadillac brand, and are apparently in charge of the negotiations with F1 now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0jsd1/general_motors_has_not_abandoned_the_idea_of/) 

So… Has the end of Andretti’s hopes and dreams for joining F1 officially come to pass? Who bloody knows, because allegedly [Andretti will have their first 2026 chassis ready before Christmas this year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0da71/exclusive_andretti_will_have_first_2026_f1/) Believe what you wish, I say!

For a quick, final hit of hardly surprising team news, [Williams have held their hands up and said they’ll compromise their 2025 season](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0144d/formula_1_announces_new_multiyear_partnership/) in favour of pouring additional resource into the new 2026 regulations and engine formula. Yeah, you and the rest of the grid… Relatedly, Carlos Sainz Sr. has spilled his beans on [why Young Carlos rejected Audi in favour of Williams.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fzu17g/williams_is_a_project_thats_going_up_carlos/)

After rumblings and rumours about the new 2026 cars gestating into hot piles of trash that can’t overtake and will have to slow down on the straights in order to recharge their batteries, Aston Martin TP Mike Krack claims that [F1 is/will be in a much better place in 2026 after agreeing to increase the cars’ downforce.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0ca7x/f1_in_a_much_better_place_after_agreeing_to/) Downforce ain’t everything though race fans… Only time will tell!

I'm not saying that's necessarily *the* characteristic of the great drivers, just that some have it and others don't.

Of the recent ones, I would say Schumacher, Alonso and arguably Verstappen have this attitude. They don't do this all the time, but when necessary they do it, and seem reasonably OK with the choice. 

Hamilton, Rosberg and Vettel are capable of this, and have crashed into other people deliberately (or deliberately effected a crash, if you like), but I get the sense that these were out of frustration or anger; they were never in ""control"" of the situation.

My question is: who was the last British champion driver who had that kind of ruthlessness about him? 

I don't think Button had it, nor Hill (despite that threat during Spa '98). Maybe Mansell, but I'm slightly too young to have watched him live, and my abiding image of him is pushing very hard during a race and having his car breakdown one way or another. 

Again, I don't think this is necessarily a desirable quality in a driver, nor does it mean a driver who has it is better or worse than others.

**EDIT** Thanks for your responses everyone. I guess a lot of you are quite sure it's Hamilton, which is fair enough. You never really know someone, but maybe his more ruthless side is masked by his off-track personality, which (to me at least) comes across as a bit softer than those of the three I mentioned at the top of the post. I'm trying to say this without stigmatizing discussion of mental health, but there have been times where he comes across as more psychologically vulnerable than the other drivers -- specifically in his last couple of years at McLaren, and in that battle with Rosberg. All drivers react to pressure at some point (remember that scene of Hakkinen crying in the bushes?) but I feel as if you could get into Hamilton's head, you could affect his performance in a way that you would not Schumacher or Verstappen. But maybe that's misguided.

From the replies there also seems to be a specific time period in Hamilton's career where this aggression is more evident. If we break it down, there's 

1. The McLaren years
2. The Rosberg Mercedes years
3. Post-Rosberg Mercedes

There's a little debate whether 1. or 2. is the more ""ruthless"" era, maybe both combined. Just my opinion again, but I generally feel most drivers are much more aggressive in their early years, and especially if they're in a more capable car. And the Rosberg-Hamilton years felt more full of snide jabs and highschool drama (awkward cool-down moments, passive-aggressive interviews etc.) to me than the madness of the Hamilton-Alonso year.","['Heres a surprise.

* The winner hardly gains a point advantage over say the 3rd or 4th, while in the normal race they get around the double their points

* There are only 6 sprint races in 24-25 race calendar year, which automatically makes the logic behind the 1/3 rule fall apart and devalues it further

* There's no real incentive to push 100% when the difference per position is only 1 point apart

* Cars are so reliable these days that the top 8 are almost always firmly locked in place

* FIA wants sprint races to matter, but the risk is not worth the reward with the current point system and infrequency of sprint races

* Smaller teams either get punished or have no chance to score points, since there's way less to gain for them compared to a normal race

* FIA wants sprint races to be their own special event so why do you apply a copy & paste full race logic in terms of rewards to something that works differently

Here's a proposed suggestion to revamp the point system:

>Current point system: 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

>Revamped point system: 20, 15, 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Advantages:

* The winner gets a clear point advantage over the rest

* Points are given to the Top 12

* More incentives to fight for positions

* Top teams and smaller teams are both rewarded more

* Sprint races actually have an effect on the world championship

* Teams are more likely to come up with bold strategies and we get more exciting races since the Top 12 get points now and finishing higher rewards way more points","['Terrible idea', 'Can we please stop proposing ways of making sprint races more significant than they are?\n\nIf we have to have them, I want them to be as inconsequential as possible, ideally.', 'I would revamp them into the bin', 'Woo, another ""my idea to improve sprint races"" post.""', 'Honey, wake up.

I have been involved in sports journalism for years - mainly volleyball, basketball and F1. Over the years of working for various websites, I managed to arrange interviews with many F1 drivers - among others Mario Andretti, Jody Scheckter, Thierry Boutsen, Derek Warwick, Robert Kubica, Nick Fry, Sebastien Buemi, Mario Theissen, Mika Salo. I think that over the years there have been 20+ people related to F1. All of them were published in text form on Polish websites. I suspect that the desire to talk was due to the reach of the sites I worked for, and not because of me personally.



For over a year now, I have been running my podcast (a modest project, 32 podcast episodes so far), in which I have not yet had a guest from F1. Most of them are volleyball and basketball. However, I would like to talk to someone from F1. While I know that it is very difficult to get in touch with people from the current F1 environment, theoretically it should be easier with former drivers, bosses, directors, etc. It should be, but it isn't, because unfortunately I am either ignored or rejected due to my small reach. In many cases I cannot find a contact (I often used IG, FB or websites of drivers or their companies to contact me).



Can anyone advise me on how I can get more F1 contacts or encourage F1 people to join my podcast? Sending links to previous interviews doesn't seem to work. Thanks in advance for your help. Greetings from Poland.","[""PR people are your best bet. but as youve pointed out the reach of the sites that you've worked for is probably more of a factor rather than yourself as a journalist, sorry to be blunt. regretably its a numbers game, current drivers only have so much time in a day and they'll prioritise the outlets that will give them the most reach for publicity \n\ni think youre better off trying to find someone whos not a driver currently, or someone who works/worked in f1 not as a driver. cold calling is probably the way to go if you dont have contacts already. keep talking to as many as you can, get as many people on there as possible, build interest and reach. the people you interview could eventually be a new contact to someone else, who knows. \n\nrandom names i can think of:\n\n- gunther steiner (dude is promoting his book now iirc)\n\n- hanz harald franzer (his kid makes tiktok videos featuring him) - probably butchered his name sorry \n\n- former/current mechanics, other team folk, i dunno maybe a chef... people who dont usually get interviewed and can afford to make time for you. i feel like this is your best bet tbh\n\n- other journalists, you could pitch it as an episode of two journalists talking to each other about your experiences in your respective sport (ie: your experience talking to people in volleyball/basketball)\n\n- i think some photographers might give it a go. jamey price + kym illman are very active on social media. \n\nall the bestttt"", ""What's your budget?"", ""Most relevant F1 people aren't going to want to talk to a podcast unless you:\n\nA.

--

40.9 **A Competitor may not modify any part on the car or make changes to the set-up of the suspension whilst the car is being held under parc fermé conditions.**

[I can see see at least 3-4 loopholes in that sentence e.g. what if it's not the Competitor making the changes but some physical phenomenon doing it all by itself? What if the part morphs and changes shape by itself and is thus not ""modified"" in any way, as it is doing what it was designed to do? What if you don't modify any part but you ""make changes"" to something that is not the suspension? Clever.]

In the case of a breach of this Article the relevant driver must: 

a)  start the sprint session from the pit lane and follow the procedures prescribed in Article 43.3, if the parc fermé conditions are breached from the start of the qualifying practice session until the car leaves the pit lane for the sprint session; and/or

b) start the race from the pit lane and follow the procedures prescribed in Article 44.2, if the parc fermé conditions are breached from the start of the sprint session until the car leaves the pit lane for the race. 

[Blah penalties blah]

**In order that the scrutineers may be completely satisfied that no alterations have been made to the suspension systems or aerodynamic configuration of the car (with the exception of the front wing) whilst in pre-race parc fermé, it must be clear from physical inspection that changes cannot be made without the use of tools.**

[Several loopholes in that language, e.g. it says nothing about the non-aero, non-suspension parts being changed without tools... Also says nothing about anything other than physical inspections of aero and suspension, so that leaves a lot wide open... Very clever. I actually like this a lot, exploiting as-yet unexploited loopholes in the SRs rather than the TRs. Somebody deserves a raise.]

The Finn is waiting for Sauber/Audi's decision and is also preparing to not have a cockpit next year\n\n(Motorsport-Total.com) - Who will be in the Sauber cockpit in 2025? Even before this weekend's US Grand Prix in Austin (Texas), the driver question for next year is still unresolved. Even Valtteri Bottas, who is actually considered a hot candidate, seems to be increasingly preoccupied with this - and above all unsettled!\n\nValtteri Bottas is waiting for the decision from Sauber/Audi\n\n‘I had said that I hoped everything would be sorted out by Austin, but I'm still waiting for the final decisions,’ said Bottas, who apparently can't explain why he doesn't yet have a contract for next year in his pocket. ‘I think Mattia \\[Binotto, team principal\\] should answer that question rather than me.’\n\n‘It's out of my hands,’ says the Finn, who “can't do anything at the moment” except wait and see. ‘Of course, I'm trying to do my best this week and hope that lifts the mood. That's the state of things. We've been in contact every week. I know the conditions I'm getting into and I'm just waiting for the green light.’\n\nBottas: ‘There is a risk of not having a cockpit’\n\nThe Sauber driver was unable to say how long the decision would take on Thursday ahead of the US GP. ‘A month ago, we were told as soon as possible,’ recalls Bottas, who will “hopefully soon” receive an answer regarding his future in Formula 1. ‘Of course, there will also be a deadline from my side at some point.’\n\nThe big question: Who will be in the Sauber cockpit in 2025?\n\nIf the 240-time GP starter wants to look outside Formula 1 or take on another role in the premier class, he should make a decision in the coming weeks. ‘Christmas is coming soon, and there will be no vacancies anywhere,’ warns the otherwise relaxed Finn.\n\nBottas, who has been driving in Formula 1 since 2013 and has celebrated ten Grand Prix victories to date, is therefore also worried that he will no longer have a cockpit next year. ‘In the situation I'm in now, with only one free seat, there is of course a risk,’ admits the 35-year-old honestly.\n\nMoney ‘shouldn't be the problem’\n\nHowever, Bottas rules out the possibility that it could be down to him asking for too much money, for example, because ‘that shouldn't be an issue. I think the conditions we are talking about are as they should be and I think Audi should have the budget, at least that's what they say. So I don't think that should be a problem.’\n\nAfter all, he has ‘already built up a good relationship with Mattia’ and talked about both his future and the plans for 2025. ‘I've been told everything so far,’ reveals the current Sauber driver, who also knows that Sauber/Audi has other options for 2025.\n\n‘I love Formula 1 and I want to drive in Formula 1. It's obviously a bit of a strange situation, but that's the way it is,’ explains Bottas, who has “had a lot of time to think about different things over the past three weeks, but is always positive”.\n\nValtteri Bottas ‘remains positive’\n\n‘I will remain positive,’ says the Finn, who says there is not much more he can do than perform on the track and continue to work on success with the team. However, this is not easy, because ‘if you don't have the car, it's really difficult to show what you can do’.\n\n‘And the people who make decisions also tend to look at the results,’ fears the 35-year-old. ‘It's not easy to shine at the moment, but I just have to trust Mattia. I just have to trust that he knows what he's getting from me.’\n\n‘I feel and believe that I should have this cockpit and that it's the best thing for the team,’ says Bottas optimistically ahead of the Grand Prix in Austin. Criticism such as that recently levelled by Helmut Marko and Marc Surer leaves him cold. ‘I'm in a positive mood.’\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)"", 'I always thought if Red Bull really wanted to go for a non academy driver they should have held out 2021 for Bottas. Obviously hindsight is key but I do think he could have definitely have perfomed better than Perez has. \n\nTiming is everything in F1 ig, sad to see Bottas be on the wrong side of things.', 'He’d probably be the most popular Indycar driver if he decided to go there.', ""It's an awkward position because Valtteri is a reliable driver and has done nothing wrong to warrant being dropped, but there's promising young drivers who are exciting options.\n\nI think they'll settle on a 1 year extension eventually.

This includes a reorganisation of the way the regulations are laid out, which will be divided into thematic sections for clarity and consistency. The transition to the new structure will be concluded in the next few months.\n \n>The 2026 Technical Regulations (Section C), originally approved in June 2024, were subject to extensive enhancements to the aerodynamic regulations, which have been the subject of a strong collaboration between the FIA, FOM and the Formula 1 teams. This will see a higher performance from the cars, while maintaining management of the wake characteristics to promote close and exciting racing.\n \n>The 2026 Sporting Regulations (Section B) have undergone a significant update in order to simplify and modernise their structure. They have introduced measures to regulate the energy management of the Power Units as well as the management of the adjustable aerodynamics, which will involve the deployment of the “straight-line mode” (low drag) and the “cornering mode” (high downforce). In addition, there will be three pre-season tests of three days each for the 2026 season to account for the new power units that will be adopted.\n \n>The 2026 Financial Regulations (Section D) have built on the experience gained by the FIA, Formula 1 and the teams since the first introduction of Financial Regulations in 2021. Significant effort has been made to simplify the regulations by changes in the perimeter of exclusions and adjustment methodologies and to strengthen measures available to FIA to monitor compliance to the Financial Regulations. The overall level of the cost cap has remained – in effect – equivalent to the current levels, while the changes to the actual number reflect the changes to exclusion and adjustment perimeter and the effect of cumulative inflation.\n \n> Further elements will be submitted to the World Council for approval in the coming months to complete the regulation package for 2026, while refinements to the already approved sections will continue with the collaboration between the FIA, FOM and the Formula 1 teams.\n\n>**Regulatory updates**          \n>**FIA Formula One World Championship**\n \n>Minor changes for 2024 and 2025 Sporting and Technical regulations were approved by the World Council, including the removal of the point awarded for setting the fastest lap and the increase in requirement for fielding a young driver during free practice from once per season to two times per season.', 'Doesn’t this say that teams will have to do four rookie practice sessions next year, not remove the requirement completely like people were reporting earlier?', ""It looks like somebody messed up when they tweeted about the rookie sessions.

I pulled a few different regulatory eras and tried to look at the third year of relatively stable rules, like we have now (except 2012, when I just went for the competitive 4th season).

I looked at number of winning cars and drivers, gap between the top 3 in the WDC (percentage of leaders points P3 has) and the gap between the entire field in qualifying. (I excluded any obviously erroneous results such as vastly different weather between Q1 and Q3 or cars multiple seconds away from the pack). **All data was taken for first 16 races only to make it measurable between seasons.**

|Era/Year|# Winning Teams|#Winning Drivers|Gap Between Top 3|Gap Between 1st and last Quali|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Ground Effect - 2024|4|7|72%|2.45s|
|V6 Turbo - 2016|2|4|71%|4.68s|
|KERS - 2012|4|7|78%|6.14s|
|3l V10 - 2002|3|4|35%|4.94s|
|No Driver Aids - 1996|3|4|61%|6.57s|
|Ground Effect Ban - 1986|4|5|96%|10.56s|

This season looks to be up there on all metrics apart from gap between the top 3 in the table at this stage of the season.

But what is staggering is how tight the whole field is compared to any other era, I saw some people calling Sauber ""a joke"" in another thread and this proves just how good of a job Sauber are doing compared to backmarkers of yore. The gap between P20 and P1 in Bahrain this year would have put you 6th on the grid in 1986's opener.","[""Sauber being a joke is definitely relative. They're a joke because week after week, even though their qualifying time is less than 2 seconds.

But the fact that they're able to finish races and don't trigger the 107% rule on their own makes them a step up compared to the backmarkers of yore."", 'I don\'t know. Sure.

Your analogy compares modern F1 to a local championship. The level is undeniably higher than previous eras in terms of teams.\n\nThere is no way you could watch F1 in the 80s/90s and tell me the level of the sport was higher than now. \n\nThey are both going to Super Majors, but the older teams are getting wiped out in seconds without landing a hit and Sauber are lasting a few rounds and landing a few hits without getting any wins."", ""I'm more arguing that the teams are being held back so much and Sauber is still comfortably last.\n\nJust remember, Haas is spending more now than they did in 2019.

Up until that moment, Norris would win by one point.

Then, Red Bull call Perez in to get fresh rubber. The mexican fall off the Top 5 (hell, if there was a Safety Car during the race, he could even get out of the Top 10).

And then, on the last lap, while everybody thought that Norris won, Perez set the Fastest Lap, take away Lando's extra point and Verstappen wins the championship in a tie-breaker 'cause he had more wins.

Even if McLaren noticed it, what would they do? If Norris is within 20s of Verstappen, they wouldn't pit him. They only thing they could do, more thay praying, is to send out Piastri to block Perez.

  1. 60 days prior to it hosting that race        
  2. If the Circuit did not host a race in the year falling immediately prior to the year of the championship      
  3. If the circuit is deemed to have undergone significant modification following the relevant race in the year falling immediately prior to the year of the championship     

- They can only complete a maximum of 20 days of TPC in each calendar year. And may only complete a maximum of 1000 km of TPC in each calendar year with drivers entered into the championship. And that can only be accumulated over a maximum of 4 days of that allowed 20 days of TPC.

- The requirements for *conditions of poor visibility* have been removed from the section in regards to disabling the DRS. It is now entirely up to the race director's discretion as to turning it off or on.

- As stated it is now required on 2 occasions during the championship for each car entered into the championship to use a rookie driver

- It is now formally written that should either qualifying session not happen then the grid for the sprint race or the main race will be based upon the Driver's Championship classification. The standard procedure for forming the grid in regards to penalties etc will be applied to that classification. If for whatever reason that method of forming the grid cannot be applied it shall be at the sole discretion of the stewards as to how the grid will be formed. 

- There is a clarification that if you wish to do multiple reconnaissance laps you must you use pit entry road when you wish to enter the pit lane to do so.

# 2026 [Sporting](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2026_f1_regulations_-_section_b_sporting_-_iss01_-_2024-10-17.pdf), [Technical](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2026_f1_regulations_-_section_c_technical_-_iss09_-_2024-10-17.pdf) & [Financial](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2026_f1_regulations_-_section_d_financial_-f1_teams_-_iss01_-_2024-10-17.pdf) Regulations

These are harder to write out the difference as it is quite a significant change to the regulations and more significantly they have also completely rewritten the regulations from the ground up and given them a brand new easy to read format.          
The Sporting, Technical & Financial Regulations are now split into Sections B, C & D respectively with article codes including those letters for easy cross referencing (Although they have forgotten to do this with the Financial Regulations....).

You will note there is no Section A. I believe this is because the Sporting Regulations no longer include any of the regulations in regards to the Governance of the sport, the General Undertaking of said regulations, certain bits on licences or indeed how points are awarded. I assume this section will come later.

Because of all of this it's hard to pinpoint changes, some things of note that immediately jumped out though:

- Qualifying or Practice sessions are now defined as LTCS or Lap Time Classified Sessions. Race sessions are defined as TTCS or Total Time Classified Sessions

- A whole bunch of factors in regards to the energy deployment for the Override Mode will be defined by the FIA on a race by race basis and announced 4 weeks prior to each competition. These factors include:        
  1. The maximum electrical power of the ERS-K, as a function of car speed, when the Override mode is **NOT** active        
  2. The maximum electrical power of the ERS-K, as a function of car speed, when the Override mode is active        
  3. The maximum energy that can be harvested on a single lap, when the Override mode is **NOT** active        
  4. The maximum energy that can be harvested on a single lap, when the Override mode is active when the driver crosses the line at the start of the lap       
  5. The time gap between the car in front in the detection zone so as to active the Override Mode      
  6. The position of the Detection Line       
  7. The position of the Activation Line       

I'm very sure there is significantly more that can be found and looked over.

I get that Albon is nice and doesn't make excuses. But everyone would prefer fast driver who blames everyone than a average driver who always says it is his fault. Maybe unpopular opinion but even for a rookie  it can be beneficial to have a teammate who sometimes wrongly blames him for crashes etc. (assuming the team is supportive and Williams is).

There's a spot very close to the track that is GA, where the cars are at their slowest. In practice and out lap/in lap for quali that means they're going very slow round there. \n\nMonza - Hard because T1 grandstand would be the best for the speed.   \n\nSpa - you might get some cool shots down the Kemmel when cars slow for faster cars in quali.   \n\nSpain - I only had grandstands so unsure.  \n\nZandvoort - Grandstands again."", 'Depending on the track again but your best bet would be during practice or a slow lap during qualifying.

1g7ltgt,Much Needed Context Behind the Alonso and Lawson Squabble,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7ltgt/much_needed_context_behind_the_alonso_and_lawson/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7ltgt/much_needed_context_behind_the_alonso_and_lawson/,2024-10-19,0 days,"So I looked at the onboards of lap 1. Lawson was overly aggressive with his racecraft on lap 1. Let me do a walk through:


On T11 of lap 1, he divebombed, and punted Alonso fully off the track. On that same straight, he weaved around the straight when Alonso came back at him, and Alonso had to take avoiding action.



In lap 5, Lawson was also moving under braking on turn 11. Later that lap, he closed the door on him in turn 18.


Then when you look at THE incident, Liam, again, moved pretty late on the straight to the point that alonso had to lift. The big issue there is that their scrapping meant that ocon got past. 


Alonso’s reaction is from a culmination of the incidents prior to the one where Ocon got past. I’m surprised that everybody jumped to the Alonso bullying narrative instead of posting the onboards of lap 1 and 5, that showed that Liam was too aggressive. ","[""Last year, Lawson was actually like that when he was in Super Formula, so I'm not surprised.  \nHe achieved good results with his “I'm not going to stay here long, so I don't care if you guys don't like me” approach.  \nWell, anyway, he is a tougher racer than most people think.\n\nEDIT: For clarification  \nThe quotation marks do not mean what he said, but that I felt that way about his approach.  \n(Sorry if anyone misunderstood.)"", 'Where is the video son? We need the video', 'Still, I don\'t understand how thats bad for Lawson\'s career (""It\'s his career down the line"") or being stupid given he only has 6 races. \n\nIf it proves he can be aggressive when needed, and if he end up even 1 place higher than otherwise, then the team will not complain. If anything it proves he is able to take measured risks.  Might not be to Alonso\'s liking, but making it be that he was driving stupidly is just not it.\n\nIf he had been penalized I would agree. But he wasn\'t.', 'Take your well informed analysis away from here, we don’t need it', "">I’m surprised that everybody jumped to the Alonso bullying narrative\xa0\n\nShouldn't be surprised, based on Nando's history. I wouldn't call it bullying, I'd just say he goes a bit overtop about other drivers even when he's out of the car. In the car with adrenaline pumping is understandable, they all do it. But to talk to the media about a rookie like that? It's just unbecoming. \n\nAnd then apparently Fernando told Liam he was gonna do something about it during quali? Sheesh."", 'I stopped reading at the ""out of line"". Much needed context? It\'s motor racing, bro.', ""This is not context at all lmao this is just your opinion!\n\nLap 1 T11 is not a divebomb, Alonso leaves the door wide open hoping to cut back to the apex for a better exit and Lawson takes the opportunity. Whether or not he needs to leave him room I'm not sure, but from the onboard there's a chance he's ahead at the apex and doesn't need to, from Ocon's camera it looks like Lawson is ahead. Doesn't look like he weaves on the straight, he moves left at the same time as Alonso, it's just unfortunate that they both went left at the same time, it happens sometimes. Once Alonso has committed to the inside he goes back to the racing line which is fine. Lawson is ahead at the apex and doesn't need to leave any space.\n\nLawson isn't moving under braking lap 5, T11, just showing his hand to Alonso and then moves back to the racing line, braking in a straight line, just cause he doesn't brake parallel to the edge of the track doesn't mean it's moving under braking; Alonso's not in a reasonable position to make a move so it doesn't really matter, nor is he trying to. Lawson is allowed to close the door on him on the exit of 18, he's ahead the whole way round that corner.\n\n'THE incident' Lawson starts moving left before Alonso, Alonso doesn't judge the closing speed well enough and has to get out of it. Lawson moves back to the racing line and leaves Alonso the inside, which he's allowed to do once Alonso has committed to the inside. Alonso goes deep and Lawson gets a pretty good exit towards 13, he's way ahead entering 13 and closes the door, no problems there. Alonso again goes deep due to entering on a shallow line, Ocon goes for a better exit and gets the position.\n\nI know you want your driver to do well, we all do, but if you're going to make a post like this, and don't know the rules, at least position it as your opinion, not objective fact."", 'its not that serious. Its just racing.

McLaren told Lando as early as lap 5, basically 25% into the sprint that Max's tyres were degrading too fast and also on lap 6.

This was obviously wrong information which may have inspired Lando to push more than he should to try and chase Max instead of focussing on keeping the fast Ferraris behind.

- Lando had fresher tyres
- Had DRS at a track where DRS is very powerful and the track is very wide so many overtaking opportunities 
- Was consistently using more battery than Max despite the DRS and all around faster car 
- Did the exact same thing at the exact same place for 8 laps 
- Max had a lock up and still managed to get the gap back

1g8dn0z,Questioning Albon's outright pace after the driver change,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8dn0z/questioning_albons_outright_pace_after_the_driver/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8dn0z/questioning_albons_outright_pace_after_the_driver/,2024-10-21,0 days,"Right now he and Colapinto are tied 2-2 in both qualifying and race finishes since Franco's appointment at Monza. This is an admittedly small sample size.

Median qualifying pace difference is 0.156% in favor of Colapinto in my calculation.

My hot take is that while Albon's race management has improved, his outright pace hasn't changed much since leaving Red Bull. Obviously, he destroyed Latifi and Sargeant but looking back those are very low bars to cross.

If he was put back in the Red Bull, I'm not sure he'd perform much different from his performance in 2020 vs Max or current Checo. On the other hand, maybe he has improved and Colapinto is just a quicker and better driver than I'm giving him credit for.

I'm curious to see how this develops over the last few races and also in light of the 2025 Williams lineup.","['I fully support Franco. Does he deserve a seat in another team? In my opinion, yes. However, why don’t we wait until Abu Dhabi to draw some conclusions? Franco came in strong without pressure. He has nothing to lose and Alex had both a few unfortunate situations and also is under pressure for the first time. The next couple of races could be a complete different story and our conclusions are left in the dust. Franco is competitive but that doesn’t make Alex overrated. Maybe Franco is really good? Maybe Alex had 2 bad races only? Too early to tell.', ""Colapinto has been outstanding, but I think people are writing Albon off based on little real evidence because F1 fans tend to take any possible opportunity to beat down on someone without really taking into account the contexts of why they've not been getting results.\n\nBoth of the times Colapinto has outqualified Albon have in large part been down to Albon making errors or otherwise having problems. In Azerbaijan for example Albon had the fan issue in Q3 which meant he couldn't do a final run, while in sprint quali here he obviously had the spin. That's not to discount what Franco has done because he's been very close regardless, and in the case of Austin SQ he should be applauded for *not* making an error.  They do however provide some much needed context behind Albon's losses to Franco (also I'm not sure where you're getting 2-2. It's 3-2 to Albon across the 5 quali sessions they've completed together)\n\nLikewise in the race, Albon got twatted into at T1 here which damaged his car, so I wouldn't read too much into that, and in Singapore he had car issues too which ultimately led to his retirement.\n\nColapinto is doing fantastically and I hope to see him in a Williams long-term in the not-too-distant future as a fan of the team, but Albon doesn't have to be discredited in order to recognise the brilliant showing that Colapinto is putting in."", 'I mean one of the races Albon had an ice box in this car for the last quali run and then DNF’d due to mechanical issues…\n\nBut, I think Colapinto is quick. I think they’re both getting basically all you can out of the car, where previously it was only Albon doing that. Albon’s last 2 races have been kind of ruined by some bad luck, where Colapinto has come out on the good side of some midfield scuffles. I think it shows that Albon isn’t a miracle worker, just getting the results the car was capable of.\n\nIf I were Albon, I’d be a bit nervous about what this means for my future long term, as I could see Williams being tempted by the fanatical backing that Colapinto brings if Albon gets thoroughly out performed next year. I think Albon can prove himself, but only time will tell.', ""Albon will get his chance next year to prove his actual pace.\n\nCarlos Sainz turns out to be a quite handy measuring stick for driver performance. He was outscored by a very young Max Verstappen (young but someone who would win a race for RBR the following year and look generally pretty good), beat a young Norris in 2 seasons (the second one much closer) and has been very close to Leclerc in Ferrari. In essence, we know he is pretty good, and he was never the focus of any of the teams he drove for.\n\nIf Albon can beat him handily, especially towards the end of the year, that would be a pretty good evidence that he (and Colapinto) are very good. If Sainz dominates, we'll know that Albon was flattered by poor teammates."", 'I’m prepared to give Albon the benefit of the doubt at the moment and reserve judgement until we see him against Carlos next season', 'Alex got damage on turn 1 which nuked his race, but sure lets compare apples to oranges.', ""Colapinto is great and I'm not even opposed to rating Colapinto higher since summer break, but didn't Albon have damage from Lap 1 at?

Those teammates have helped the “dragging the car where it doesn’t belong” narrative, but it just quite isn’t the reality of the situation evidently. Sainz will wipe the floor with him.

 &nbsp;

It should not be about who's ahead at the apex, but whether the drivers -whether overtaking or defending- deserve space, and that should be determined by where they are going into the braking zone.

 &nbsp;

If the defending driver is on the inside, then they shouldn't be allowed to brake too deep -therefore getting to the apex sooner... ya know... because they didn't actually try to stop the car- and run themselves and the overtaking driver (on the outside) off track.

 

Time and time again we see the overtaking driver (on the outside) getting alongside/ahead of the defending driver before the braking zone, but then getting outbraked (and by outbraked I mean the inside line defending driver doesnt try to stay on track) and the FIA says ""oh its fair because of the apex rule""... But this completely ignores the contextual information BEFORE they start braking.

 &nbsp;

This is especially annoying because the FIA said they were going to implement a new rule for the 2022 season that required the defending driver (on the inside) to give space to the overtaking driver (on the outside), as long the the overtaking driver's front wheels were even/ahead of the defending driver's rear wheels at the apex.

Why was Piastri given a 5 second penalty for forcing another driver off, but the way that Sainz passed Leclerc, and then they BOTH passed Russell wasn't forcing ?

Piastri knew he wouldn’t make the corner.', 'Here\'s the theory.....  it\'s up to you to decide whether the facts of any situation fit or not...\n\nThe driver in the lead is free to choose his own line...

This is a free choice and they were not forced to do anything...\n\n2) The attempted overtake has not been completed by the apex, the outside driver is supposed to be free to choose whatever line they want...   but they can\'t turn in as much as they want because there\'s a car there... forcing them to not turn in on thier intended path... if the inside car has actually slowed enough that it can leave a car-width at the exit then they will (or at least, should)... and the outside car will likely retain the lead... but a failed dive-bomb attempt usually results in a car that\'s heading to the outside of the track (or even off it)... and so the car that is supposed to have free choice of line is forced to run off the track to avoid a collision...\n\nAnd so while the outside car has run out of room on the track in either situation... only one of them is considered to be ""forced off the track"".\n\nAnd then in either of those cases... both cars also need to avoid gaining an advantage while off the track...  even if you\'re forced to run wide by a dive-bomb that didn\'t get past before the apex, that doesn\'t give you an excuse to keep your foot on the accelerator and sweep around the outside (assuming sufficient runoff exists to allow that).', 'They were marginal.\n\nWith Piastri, he came from behind and forced the Alpine off he was basically just alongside.\n\nWith the Ferrari they were almost fully past the other car and then ran them wide to optimise their corner.', 'FIA have basically decided if you are ahead at the apex you have ownership of the corner and can basically just run other cars off track without consequence.\n\nOscar was not ahead at the apex.

He managed to overtake his championship rival in lap 52. But the stewards slapped a 5s penalty against him for doing so outside the track. Lando’s 4s lead over Max was not enough to hold on to the third position.

Lando’s attack was inspiring but Max’s defense set the stage for the epic duel. It was clear that Red Bull was the slower car compared to Mclaren. Yet, the way Max managed to position the car brilliantly in the chicanes defending against a blistering McLaren with DRS advantage reflects his sheer talent of racecraft. Laps 42-51 by Max was an exhilarating exhibition of F1 defense at its finest.

However, Max isn’t someone known to always think with a cool head while being challenged by a rival. Words such as ‘reckless’, ‘unapologetic’, ‘rash’ were often used to describe his driving style during earlier seasons. But since the fateful night of 8 December, 2020, in Abu Dhabi, since Max won his first championship title, he seems to have calmer demeanour. I don’t mean he has become less aggressive in any way or sorts. But he surely seems more composed than before. This metamorphosis has made me develop a new kind of appreciation towards him this season.

Maybe learning from experience is the hallmark of true F1 legends. Lewis Hamilton in 2014 vs Lewis Hamilton in 2019. Max in 2016 vs Max in 2024. While Lando has a burning desire to win the F1 championship, maybe he needs some more experience to master what it takes to overcome the pressures of the closing stages when the finest of margins determine the class of an F1 championship winning driver. Or maybe it’s those maddeningly elusive wins – victories snatched from him by heart-wrenching, podium-costing errors in the final laps – that he really needs to go from being a good to a truly great racer.","['> Or maybe it’s those maddeningly elusive wins – victories snatched from him by heart-wrenching, podium-costing errors in the final laps – that he really needs to go from being a good to a truly great racer.\n\nWhatever you say, ChatGPT.', '\xa08 December, 2020? not even close.', 'As much as max is complained about for driving ‘reckless’ and dangerously, that is exactly what an upcoming champion is supposed to do and landing should be doing that now.

I don't want to go too much into Austria but I felt he was silly to attempt and outside overtake at that corner, especially up against MV.
At the British GP, unable to hunt down Hamilton, in US had time but again went outside, difficult and add to that you have Max Verstappen. In my neutral view , it was a simple decision gained an advantage over the white line.

But before I do, I want to say I am a Norris fan and if some parts of this question come across as biased I am sorry, but I am also only human.

Now the important part.  
I see McLaren (and some others) fans complaining that the stewards are not consistent with their decision and citing the Russel incident was handled differently than the Norris-Verstappen incident. BUT again other people argue, that those 2 incidents are not comparable, because Russel was attacking and Verstappen was defending. And I totally agree that those two scenarios should be handled differently, attacker and defender should have different rules applied to them.

And now the question: ""When is an overtaking attempt finished?""

I looked at the TV camera angles and Norris POV again (because I could not find Verstappen POV, pls link if someone can find it) and it looks like Norris is with the full car ahead on the straight already. Could someone argue, that that means, that Norris was not the attacker in the corner but the defender and Verstappen was the (re-)attacker in that scenario.

Is there something in the rulebook, that defines, when an overtaking attempt is over? (and was successful or not?) I would really like an answer and am not just trying to be salty, I hope I wrote this question neutral enough.","[""I'd just think daily normal traffic... I don't really consider that I have overtaken a truck on a 100km/h road before I'm back in my own lane and don't have to consider the truck's position anymore."", ""Anthony Davidson had a pretty good analysis of it.

1g87bbt,What’s with the overtaking rules? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g87bbt/whats_with_the_overtaking_rules/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g87bbt/whats_with_the_overtaking_rules/,2024-10-20,0 days,"So after Russell’s penalty this got me thinking - in any other type of motorsport that’s a penalty - he did force him off the track and to be honest I agree with it.

*But* that penalty was inconsistent to what we’ve seen recently - most notably t1 with Norris and Verstappen. So, for the purpose of this post let’s ignore Russel’s penalty as that’s another whole discussion.  

If the rules for the most part are that you can get away with that then why is that the case?
You can just go into a corner and escort your opponent wide? What’s with that? - we will never see any interesting racing.

Especially when the driver that’s been pushed off can’t even fight back because they’ll get a penalty for “keeping the position by going off track” when they had nowhere else to go. 

If it were up to me you’d have to leave a cars width to the car on the outside, when overtaking and defending, as is the rules in most other respects of motorsport afaik. 

Am I alone in thinking this?

1g8vcfo,Texas GP Norris 5sec penalty - an objective perspective and discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8vcfo/texas_gp_norris_5sec_penalty_an_objective/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8vcfo/texas_gp_norris_5sec_penalty_an_objective/,2024-10-21,0 days,"There has been a lot of discourse and blame being thrown at various parties from Max to FIA. As someone who would like to see someone dethrone Max just for the heck of it but does not particularly like Lando I think I can be quite objective when it comes to this situation.

1st Let's get the blame game out of the way. Max should not be blamed for taking advantage of the rules as this is something that happens in any sport when a team or individual is doing everything they can to win. We should not blame Lando or McLaren even though some say McLaren should not have told Lando keep the position in which they aren't totally wrong. The problem is the rules and how they are being applied.

The rules have to get better and more clear, and fast as this incident sets a horrible and dangerous precedent that can have a terrible effect on so many things from fair competition to safety. I do not understand how the FIA can get so specific with technical regulations but when it comes to such an important aspect of on track battles be so silly and imprecise.

Some people have been saying that they should add a gravel trap at the corner but this is a band-aid solution for one corner on one track. Let's be real. The track limits should be respected the same way everywhere regardless what is beyond them. If there was a wall there, both Lando and Max would have smashed into it and it would be obvious who is at fault. At the very least (and I am quite surprised that the stewards did not use a ""spirit of the regulations"" reasoning to come to this conclusion) if both cars go off with all 4 wheels then the overtake is legal if we are going to stick to the 1st to the apex mantra. This racing to the apex at all costs must be eliminated. I really think the best way to look at it is ""What if there was a wall beyond track limits?"". It should not matter if it is tarmac, grass, gravel or anything else beyond the track limits. You don't see basketball, soccer or tennis players getting treated different for out of bounds situation depending on the field or court they are on, why should it be any different in F1? With all the money in the sport perhaps it is time to invest in technology that can automate at least a part of the boundary monitoring to further help reduce or eliminate track limit abuse and shenanigans.

What do you think? What is the best solution?

1g92xpg,A question about Hamilton being in Ferrari next year,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g92xpg/a_question_about_hamilton_being_in_ferrari_next/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g92xpg/a_question_about_hamilton_being_in_ferrari_next/,2024-10-21,0 days,"((I'm not that good at explaining ideas, if it's too vague, please ask))

Whenever a driver for Ferrari wins, it's a win for the italians. If you look back at this weekend's podium celebration, the monaco anthem was pretty quiet compared to the italian, everyone chanting it and all. There were much bigger celebrations in Monza, considering it's the Italian GP, to what we saw at Monaco, even though it was also a home win and something really huge for Ferrari and Leclerc. But even earlier, when Schumacher was at Ferrari or any other big name, it was never about them, but more about the team I believe.

In short: Ferrari is italian and above the driver.

On the other hand, throughout Hamilton's career, winning has always been about him, and not the team. If we compare the celebrations of a win in Germany and Great Britain, it's obvious that a true home victory was in Silverstone, rather than Germany, Mercedes' home country.

In short #2: Hamilton is british and above the team

So my question is, how do you think it will play out, that someone we could call an independent driver will go to a team, where the team is more important? It's undoubtably a huge environment change for Hamilton and he will have to adapt. Do you think that this could work out in the long term, without any controversies or oppositions rising between the two? Can their immense fanbases be merged into one?

In my opinion, this will probably not turn out as people expect it to, and will be a troublesome relationship between the team and the driver. We've seen many big names fail under Ferrari, such as Vettel, Alonso or Prost. Will this be a repeat of what happened before, or could it be the next Hamilton/Ferrari-dominance era?

Edit: please try to address to question of how you think it will play out","['Look at Schumacher, one of the most self driven and individual characters, during his time at Benneton it was all about him, he was the superstar, winning in Germany was everything.\n\nHe goes to Ferrari and he is conducting the Italian national anthem.\n\nFerrari changes people and Lewis has a passion for the history of the sport, he will be all swept up in Ferrari fever if he gets a win.', 'I think Lewis is going to be much happier at Ferrari than he is at Mercedes nowadays', '> the monaco anthem was pretty quiet compared to the italian\n\nThis isn\'t really a Ferrari thing, it\'s an Italian thing, for whatever reason they\'re the only people who sing along to the anthem - when Toro Rosso & Alpha Tauri won races the mechanics did the same.\n\n> On the other hand, throughout Hamilton\'s career, winning has always been about him, and not the team.

Or that Michael valued his wins in Germany? No, it wasn\'t, there is absolutely no problem with the driver valuing their home race for themselves, I\'m quite sure Hamilton\'s mechanics will know how important Silverstone is to him and will be eager to do what they can to help him win at home, and I\'m quite certain Hamilton will want desperately to win in Italy for Ferrari because it\'s so significant for the team.', 'You should also consider that the Mercedes F1 team is based in the UK, not far from Silverstone, and for that reason, they somehow consider Silverstone a home race.', 'TF have I just read \n\nWho watches LeClerc’s wins this year at Monaco and Monza and still thinks this 🤣', "">On the other hand, throughout Hamilton's career, winning has always been about him, and not the team.\n\nSo... you have never actually watched F1 then?"", '“jessie, wtf are you talking about??”', 'Gentlemen, a short view back to the past', "">On the other hand, throughout Hamilton's career, winning has always been about him, and not the team.\n\nThe guy who always thanks the team after a race and constantly mentions how he wouldn't have achieved what he has without them?

Apparently there is a more recent version but not publicly available. Key point is 


Guidelines for overtaking on the outside of a corner:


- In order for a car being overtaken to be required to give sufficient room to an overtaking car, the
overtaking car needs to have a significant portion of the car alongside the car being overtaken and
the overtaking manoeuvre must be done in a safe and controlled manner, while enabling the car to
clearly remain within the limits of the track.

- When considering what is a ‘significant portion’, for an overtaking on the outside of a corner, among
the various factors that will be looked at by the stewards when exercising their discretion, the
stewards will consider if the overtaking car is ahead of the other car from the apex of the corner.

- The car being overtaken must be capable of making the corner while remaining within the limits of
the track.


So Lando wasn't ahead at the apex hence wasn't entitled to room. However, the last point says that Max must be capable of making the corner as well. So IMO they are both in the wrong (or call it a racing incident). Thoughts?

EDIT: obviously these are 'guidelines' only but you would hope stewards would attempt to follow them for consistency","['The ""among the various factors the stewards will consider"" part is clear as fucking mud.\n\nI mean obviously they don\'t think being ahead at the apex is the only factor, or they\'d just say that, but instead they seem to be calling that out as the main factor but not the only one. As a result I can see why Lando\'s so pissed, if the only thing that matters is being ahead at the apex, just say that.', ""Both did something wrong (leaving the track).\n\nI assume the stewards saw wrongdoing from both Verstappen and Norris because both were too fast for the corner, kind of offsetting each other.\n\nThat doesn't mean Norris is allowed to overtake off track though."", 'It would have been a racing incident if Lando had not gained a position. He did, and therefore, penalty.', "">So IMO they are both in the wrong (or call it a racing incident).\n\nYou are correct, they're both in the wrong for leaving the track, so it offsets, racing incident. \n\nWhile off track, Lando then passed Max, causing the penalty."", 'Agreed. Either both penalties or , what it should be classed as, good hard racing.', ""If both drivers had been given a 5 second penalty there'd by no controversy at all. Russel got 5 seconds for going down the inside, staying on track and forcing Bottas off. By that metric, Max forced Lando off, Lando overtook off track. 5 seconds each or nothing each.\xa0"", 'Broken link', 'Both wrong, but one more wrong basically (by way of how far off the track he went) + Being behind at the Apex + Gaining a lasting advantage at the end of it all. \n\n  \nThats 3 reasons all of which in my opinion make it an easy Slam Dunk penalty.', ""Just want to say that from 1 January 2025, the Driving Standards Guideline will be codified into Appendix L of the International Sporting Code and will be applicable to all circuit racing which follows the Code.\n\n[This has come about from the FIA Drivers' Committee in partnership with the FIA’s Circuit Commission and Safety Department.](https://www.fia.com/news/fia-drivers-committee-delivers-driving-standards-guidelines-circuit-racing-championships)\n\nSo in future we will have a consistent reference point to shout about.""]",39,117,2024-10-21 20:25:39, Discussion,3,0

As for overtaking on the outside of a corner, the guidelines acknowledge that it is a more difficult move to pull off.

For a long time drivers have been taught from karting all the way through the racing pyramid that if you try to hang it round the outside, you are at risk of running out of road.

It’s often been left up to how hard certain drivers race. ‘Fairer’ drivers will leave a bit of room for their rivals, more ruthless drivers will edge them out.

But in recent years there has been a clear effort to define when it’s essential for a driver to leave space, and that’s the case in the new guidelines as well.

So, for a driver to be given room when overtaking on the outside, including at the exit of the corner, the overtaking car must:

-Have the front axle AT LEAST ALONGSIDE the front axle of the other car at the apex of the corner AND to the exit
-Be driven in a safe and controlled manner throughout the manoeuvre (entry, apex and exit)
-Be able to make the corner within the track limits

In a lot of cases this is going to leave a driver at the mercy of their rival or the laws of physics as cars on the inside wash out.

This isn’t intended to stop an optimistic pass, it just means drivers have to accept the risks involved. It is quite close to being a codified ‘live by the sword, die by the sword’ rule. ","['>\t— Be driven in a safe and controlled manner throughout the manoeuvre (entry, apex and exit)\n\n>\t— Be able to make the corner within the track limits\n\nabout that….', 'I feel like ahead at the apex loses all meaning when Max is only ahead at the apex because he has no intention of keeping the car on track.', 'Sorry for the odd formatting… doing from my phone!', 'Is Lando even considered the overtaker, if he is ahead prior to the braking zones?', ""What is the source for this though?  There is so much discussion on rules but I can't find the Fia regs on driving standards anywhere apart from a small clarification from a few years ago."", 'But those rules apply to the overtaker, not the defender. It seems like the responsibility falls entirely on the attacker, which we may or may not agree with, but that appears to be the current interpretation.', ""It does actually, part of the same rule that applies to overtaking this way also states that the driver being overtaken must also stay within track limits, it's posted with a link in another secondary comment here"", ""Don't bother presenting common sense to jobsworths."", 'Braking zone, per this reading, doesn’t matter at all.

 - Lawson (2 pts)

Ollie Bearman is the only one not currently racing in F1 and thus stands as a stationary target, but by claiming 7th place at Saudi, the other two will need to claim a total of 8 points to become the victor.

Franco Colapinto only needs 3 more points to claim the crown. Depending on the Sauber seat, he still may not make it onto the 2025 grid meaning he has nothing to lose in this race to the rookie title.

Finally, we have the latest 2024 debutant Liam Lawson. While the furthest behind, Lawson does have a faster car & more F1 experience than Colapinto. He will need to earn more than a point every round (beating what Ricciardo could do) to claim victory.

1g8w43j,F1 calendar idea - bring back non-championship GPs,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8w43j/f1_calendar_idea_bring_back_nonchampionship_gps/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8w43j/f1_calendar_idea_bring_back_nonchampionship_gps/,2024-10-21,0 days,"So, I think most people agree that 24 races is too many, and that young drivers aren't getting the chances they need these days. Which led me to think that we should bring back non-championship status for some races. Ideally we'd have 16 championship races and 8 non (all arranged by F1/FIA with the championship races rotating around), with the non-championship races having different rules (max 4 cars per team up to 26 entrants, no requirement for all teams to attend). This would lead to:

1) Better opportunities for young drivers - have 4 academy drivers you want to evaluate? Stick them all in a car for a race or two
2) Reduce the championship length (hopefully meaning we have fewer dead rubbers at the end of the year)
3) Smaller teams can avoid some of the expense of too many fly-away races by picking and choosing when they enter
4) FIA/F1 can try new ideas (reverse grids, two shorter races in one weekend) without affecting the sporting integrity of the championship

There's obviously need to be some serious consider given to how you keep the races out of the cost cap and part-usage rules, but even that might lead to some better racing as we could go back to kamikaze engines and driving right at the limit

Thoughts?","[""I'm not sure if team personnel would be particularly happy about having to go to 8 races that are inconsequential"", 'Why would teams build and enter two extra cars for races that have no impact on anything?', ""Most teams don't really have the resources to build up more than 2 cars.

Venues won't want to host the exhibition events because it will be harder to attract fans or make as much money off the event."", 'There is too much money and logistics involved for one-off races.

All the talk about stewarding decisions taking the action and not the consequences into consideration is again bullshit as its not happening.

Why do not give Max a 5 sec penalty?. Would be just fair and consistend as Max was definitely in the wrong doing the same stuff as 3 other drivers that got a penalty.

/Edit: And also to make it clear i do not argue gor Lando not getting a Penalty that was correct also as he still gained an advantage bei going this far off.

The apex rule is ambiguous and easily exploited, but overtaking off the track is pretty clearcut. Had he let Max go there, he could've argued that he couldn't overtake because he was pushed off. Besides that, he would've had the pace to get him after that, so maybe that was the smarter move anyway. Lando and Mclaren need to be smarter in my opinion.

There’s been a lot of negativity surrounding Norris lately (often times understandable of course) but at this point people are unfairly starting to doubt his pace. I just wanted to let some of his extreme detractors know to remember the pace he still has.

While Lando has made some errors, it’s not fair to act as if the McLaren is at the level of the RB19, and that he’s just slow. Oscar himself has as many points as Lando since Barca or something purely because of Lando’s Austria crash which was 100% not his fault. Ironically he was driving that race exactly how people seem to want him to, aggressively but as a result he was criticised for that drive.

I wanna say funnily enough Lando had a decent race and the first lap incident wasn’t even his fault. He had a better start than both verstappen and leclerc, and due to that if he did push max deep left, max was far enough behind to just go right and take it from the outside while Norris would be stuck taking the turn from a very disadvantageous angle. And max pushed him out so far it was insane nothing came of that from the race control, but I can understand to an extent because it was a first lap incident. There was literally nothing Lando could have done to stop the two Ferraris lol.

I’ll be the first to agree he is making mistakes recently but let’s not forget he was incredible all the way until Canada, very likely the second best driver at that point, and very mistake free. Since then it was a little iffy but allow me to make the case that it’s not as bad some think.

He made a crucial error in Barca and should have won that race. Grave mistake count = 1 (and the first of a very stellar season up until then). Austria was not his fault, he drove like we at Reddit want him to, aggressively and lost it due to something max did (not intentional of course). Then we get to GB, he was impeccable for a while, until his team made a call which let’s be honest Lewis was only able to make because of his vast experience, and I hope Lando learns over time too, but if you see the radio, it’s clear Norris was ready to go on the softs and it’s just as fair to blame him for this as it would be to blame leclerc for Canada. Hungary, yes he was faster at the end but I’m not gonna argue this, grave mistake count 2. Belgium, they had no pace. Zandavoort, another start error but he won (fine, count 3). Monza, it was clarified the start error was due to a glitch and the team really really fucked it. Baku, yellow flags, proven and done, had a stellar race. Singapore, he dominated lol. And I already explained COTA above, and he gets so much flak for the end when usually for any other driver it’s always the team that tells them to give the place back.

So he had 3 start errors, and he had a fantastic season apart from that and people are way too biased imo. Every driver except Charles and Max had less mistakes than that. It was a single type of mistake which he seemed to rectified. He even had the faster start yesterday.","['I have nothing against his pace.\n\nIt is his racecraft that is under scrutiny.', 'Lando is not a bad driver by any means. But he’s up against one of the greatest of all time. He has had the better car for quite some time now, but hasn’t been able to pull the championship towards him.

He's had the fastest car for the majority of the year, and has managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory multiple times. He's a very good driver, but not quite at the level necessary to be a world champion right now. Hopefully this offseason will be his opportunity to make the leap necessary to genuinely challenge for a title next year, and hopefully McLaren (and their strategy team) are able to give him the tools necessary to do so. If Ferrari look as competitive as they have for the last couple of races, then that McLaren window of opportunity gets very small between now and the new regs in 2026."", 'Unfortunately for Norris it’s a racing championship not a time trial championship', ""He's had the fastest car since Miami and the gap is now four points greater than it was then. Your pace can look good, your qualifying can look good, it can all *look* good but ultimately it hasn't been all that.

Lando tends to collect a couple before getting to this stage and can't hang with Max's (legal) shithousery. 

Now obviously this is not in the spirit of racing. But Max is able to use this to his advantage whereas Lando seems to be too idealistic in his approach to this and refuses to play the game on Max' terms. This could be costing him the championship.

There should be a rule concerning the legality of outbraking yourself to be ahead at the apex with no realistic shot of making the corner. But then we get into the weird area when you would be punished for what could be considered a genuine mistake (misjudging braking point). Curious how this will develop.","['Lando was getting more warnings as he was trying to catch Max.\n\nIf Max was extending the track limits to defend then Lando was doing it to attack.', ""Unfortunately for Lando the Great Britain GP is already gone, so he can't ram Max inside Copse."", 'Is Lewis the only driver who has successfully countered max’s approach over a whole season?', ""Yet after Lando (illegally) passed Max, he was at his max warnings, while Max had gathered just the singular warning for that defensive move.

Doesn\'t even matter if you can make the corner, or not, as long as you were the first at the apex. Lewis knows better, and the way he handled it at Hungary shows exactly that. He knew what Max was going to do before he done it, and set him up. With the speed he often carries into turns when going for that move there is no way he\'ll make the turn.\n\nLando still needs to mature quite a bit to be at a level he can take take that fight to Max. Both Lando and McLaren, for that matter. They should have given the place back right away, and go for it again. if the plan was to take the penalty and keep track position, then they should have done it 5 laps earlier to give him the time to pull a 5 seconds gap.', ""Leclerc hasn't been in that position enough, curious how the two of them would go about a title fight."", ""I mean, so far he's the only driver to fight Max for a whole season.

To me this reads that to be allowed to keep the position in front of Norris, Max would have to stay within track limits on the exit which he didn’t do, therefore (according to this guideline) would have been penalised if Norris had conceded the place?

> 7. Clarification on Forcing a Driver Off-Track

>Race: 2021 Brazilian Grand Prix

>Incident: Verstappen defended his position by pushing Lewis Hamilton wide at Turn 4, causing both cars to leave the track.

>Rule Clarification: The FIA issued clearer guidelines on overtaking and defending. If an overtaking car is significantly alongside, the defending driver must leave at least one car's width of space. Drivers must not deliberately force another driver off the track. Detailed criteria were provided for stewards to assess incidents consistently.","[""Did this actually get codified into a rule, or did it just get discussed a lot at the time?\n\nIf it was put into a set of stewards guidelines, it's very likely those guidelines have just been updated since 2021 and this part has been superseded by something else."", '“Significantly alongside” for the overtaking car on the outside was later clarified (ahead of the 2022 season) as being “ahead at the apex”.\n\nhttps://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-rules-of-conduct-drivers-published-fia/10111620/\n\n> **For overtaking outside of a corner**\n\n> In order for a car being overtaken to be required to give sufficient room to an overtaking car, the overtaking car needs to have a significant portion of the car alongside the car being overtaken and the overtaking manoeuvre must be done in a safe and controlled manner, while enabling the car to clearly remain within the limits of the track.\n\n> When considering what is a ‘significant portion’, for an overtaking on the outside of a corner, among the various factors that will be looked at by the stewards when exercising their discretion, the stewards will consider if the overtaking car is ahead of the other car from the apex of the corner. The car being overtaken must be capable of making the corner while remaining within the limits of the track.\n\nThis has since being tweaked slightly, IIRC.', ""My best guess is that *significantly alongside* was too vague of a term, which makes consistency more difficult for the stewards. When are you significantly alongside and at what point do you measure if someone is significantly along side? How does a driver know if someone is significantly alongside? Maybe they decided that the easiest way to see that was to see which car can get their nose ahead at the apex. \n\nBut like I said, it's a guess. It would be nice if we got more information or access to the actual guidelines for 2024. That would make judging the stewards decisions a bit easier."", 'The “significantly alongside” wording is vague and shouldn’t be used. \n\nJust make it simple, “during an on track battle, the defending car must leave enough room on either the inside or outside of the corner so as to not push the attacking car off track.”\n\nDone', 'Good question.\n\nI thought I remembered a clarification post Brazil 2021 that Max’s defence would be treated as illegal.\n\nFurther evidence that Max “got away with it” on Sunday', 'u/Excludos says it was never codified, but was a clarification that only lasted like half a season.', ""Difference is probably that Verstappen stayed ahead versus Hamilton, but Norris overtook off track?\n\nIf Norris stayed behind Verstappen, I'd imagine Verstappen would've been told to cede the position or get a penalty."", 'Must be confusing for the drivers whether it is permissible or not. Sounds like they’ve received guidance in the past that it’s not permissible, no guidance that it is permissible, yet it’s never been formally codified. \n\nIt seems entirely plausible that some drivers are under the impression it’s not permissible and other under the impression that it is permissible. \n\nSurely that’s an untenable situation?\n\nIt will be a spicy drivers building in Mexico for sure', 'Seems to be mixed views on that. Plenty of people here saying Max’s defence was legal.\n\nIn any case, what Lando does off track (which was illegal by the way) has no bearing on the legality of Max’s move which was very similar in Austin and Brazil.']",5,12,2024-10-22 14:22:50, Discussion,5,12

I can’t remember a title race like this before…it’s highly possible, albeit unlikely, that neither of them could win a race again this season. I’ve been watching since ’98 and this feels very unique.

As a Latin American I want all drivers from here to do great and have a chance. Also meaning those who had a chance and can not make it in a top team should be dropped and make space for the ones who want a chance.

So I wonder how does contracts work? Because for example I know Oscar was driving for other team Jr program and then got into McLaren.

So we have teams with drivers who are obviously underperforming (given their pairs performance) and many young drivers (the ones who have won F2 championships on the past, for example, or Franco who looks obviously capable of running F1 and brings Williams HUGE marketing strategy that runs on its own with the crazy fan base that guy has. If he makes it to another season it will become a cult lol

So not me being an expert but basically Stroll and Checo if you ask me (I’m no expert so please correct me if I am wrong). The RB car might be shit this season in comparison to what they had before but it is still waaaaay better than the Williams who don’t even think of them as their competitors because they are supposed to be between the top three. How is Checo not making a podium or being more relevant? 

So I guess my question is, what would need to happen for him to get a 2025 contract? Could another team besides Williams just offer more and get him? Or would he be supposed to stay as Williams reserve?

I don’t know and I need someone with more knowledge to tell me what your idea is and in which cases we would get more of his post-race interviews next year. He looks so genuine and like he actually drives for fun even though is a so serious job.

Let’s please keep Franco 🥲","[""I think the most realistic thing is to take the route Lawson took.

Winning is the biggest element but do not underestimate the money making part. RB are happy with Checo since his contract brings a lot of Mexican sponsorship money.

Perez has massive financial backing from a very rich Mexican in Carlos Slim, which supposedly pays Red Bull enough to compensate for any drops in the WCC due to his poor performance. Lance’s dad literally owns the Aston Martin F1 team so that seat is his until he decides to retire, basically. Sucks, but business is business unfortunately.

Going by track layout and their history, Ferrari could be good, but colder temps could play spoiler.\n\n\nInterlagos - A pretty front limited track that rewards cars that can manage front wear as well as those that have stable rear ends. Mostly high speed corners and straights, which makes aerodynamic efficiency king around her. I'd say McLaren are the favourites here given that they have really good aerodynamic efficiency.\n\n\nLas Vegas - Again, long straights and short radius, slow corners, makes it pretty rear limited. But without the altitude to compensate, it makes having a good balance between rear and front grip very important, as various teams will probably find different wing levels useful. Would say Ferrari are the favourites given that they were great at Baku, which is similar to this, but it being a night race could screw up their qualifying like we saw in Singapore.\n\n\nQatar - Hot, humid, full of stupidly fast corners that make following nearly impossible and also make it probably the most front limit track on the calendar. The one with good front tire wear, will win. Hard to say who will be the favourites, but the high temps and deg could make Ferrari the favourites like in COTA.\n\n\nAbu Dhabi -It's a track that needs a car that is a jack of all trades. Two long straights means aerodynamic efficiency is important, S3 is traction land, but there's also a bunch of sweepers that make having a good front end important. I'd say given that it needs an overall best car, McLaren is in best shape, but higher temps could again put Ferrari into the mix."", ""From what I can see (I'm no expert), Ferrari suit tracks with lots of low speed corners, 90 degree corners, acceleration zones and long straights.\n\nMcLaren suit the downforce heavy tracks with lots of medium and high speed corners. \n\nAnd Red Bull suit tracks where Max can outperform the car...\n\nRest of season I think suitability will favour Ferrari at Mexico, McLaren at Brazil (Max is pretty good there though), Ferrari at Vegas, McLaren at Qatar and perhaps Red Bull at Abu Dhabi since it doesn't seem especially suited to the other two."", 'Great write up!

I\'m having trouble understanding what any of this means lol\n\nOr another, ""having a pointy front end to avoid understeer"". I kind of get it, but why does a pointy front end help to avoid understeer? It cuts through the air and let\'s you be more agile? And how do you assess which cars have more points front ends? Is this something you can easily see on the cars, or an understanding based on explanations from teams directly?  \n\nThis stuff intrigues me, but it\'s so nuanced so it\'s tricky to break into a solid understanding for me.  \n\nThat\'s a lot of questions, so I apologize if it\'s kind of word vomit, but I appreciate if anyone has any insight to offer.', 'Great analysis!

I\'ll leave those terms for your own reading time!\n\n""Pointy"" in ""pointy front end"" doesn\'t refer to the shape of the car\'s nose, but rather how well it responds to steering inputs.

1g9btwi,How does 2021-2024 Verstappen compare to 2010-2013 Vettel ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9btwi/how_does_20212024_verstappen_compare_to_20102013/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9btwi/how_does_20212024_verstappen_compare_to_20102013/,2024-10-22,0 days,"Hi everyone,

I unfortunately was'nt watching F1 when Seb won his 4 WDC, but the vibe I get is that he was very good, and winning even when the car was not that dominant.

I feel like Seb had a steeper decline in performance/results than Hamilton or Alonso, tarnishing his reputation a little bit, and at the same time it seems that everybody thinks that Max is and will always be an unstoppable machine for the next few years.

How was Seb viewed back in 2012 or 2013 ? Was he seen as dominant a driver as Max is seen today ?","['By the general public he was viewed really highly but I would say the people more involved would rate Max higher. Alonso especially never rated Vettel that high (and he was right imo). Vettel, while great in a car that suited him, was never as adaptable as the likes of Lewis and Fernando and never as relentless as Max.', 'I love both drivers. I think at their respective peaks, they were/are equally fast. But I think Max has a higher ceiling than Seb.', ""Vettel was never rated as highly as Verstappen is now. He made very hard work of winning what should have been a fairly easy 2010 title and then Alonso took him to the wire in a weaker car in 2012. 2010 should have been a dominant WDC really. 2012 the McLaren was as good but the team kept making operational errors.  People knew he was good but most seemed to realise he probably wasn't as good as the very best of his generation.\n\nVerstappen on the overhand is seen as a generational talent who is the standout driver of his generation."", ""Verstappen is the better driver. Vettel's pace advantage over Webber in 2010 and 2012 was fairly small."", 'Nope and **not even close.**\n\nAlonso\'s famous interview says it all: ""We will see how Vettel will perform when he has car like others""\n\nIn 2008, Vettel\'s greatest achievement was pole - win in Monza \'08. But Toro Rosso had pace and Sebastian Bourdain, **his teammate also qualified P4** (didn\'t start due issue).\n\nIn 2010, Vettel won because Alonso was basically 1 vs 2 situation and logical thing was to cover Webber to win title. If he had a teammate that can perform too, he wouldn\'t be 1vs2 situation against RedBull.\n\nIn 2011, Car was too fast already. He finished 122 points ahead of Button who finished 2nd.\n\nIn 2012\'13 are actually where **Alonso legend really begins**. He give a title fight with a car that is not supposed to fight for the title. There are many videos on youtube how he struggles to keep the car on the road.\n\nIn \'14, Ricciardo came and beat him easily.\n\nAnd Mark Webber wasn\'t same with Pirelli tyres + old age who about to retire. Vettel made rookie-like mistakes during this era too but car was good enough to cover.\n\nIn 2017, he lost a lot points for pointless errors like hitting Lewis on purpose, In 2018, there are 9 rookie-like mistakes losing points to Lewis and Ferrari had better car that year.\n\n**Both in Red Bull & Ferrari, Vettel was there as #1 driver for 4-5 years and new guy came up Ricciardo/Leclerc and beat him easily without a problem.**\n\n**Even Bottas give better title fight runs against Lewis with mental pressure of 1 year contract, #2 driver and Vettel actually performed worse with better car against Lewis as #1 driver.**\n\nIn the end, he was good enough to make best of the car he had but when there was a rivarly or someone that can fight, he always lost.\n\nI\'m a Lewis supporter (Rosberg prior) and Max is about to win the title with RBR is about to finish 3rd in constructors. That says a lot about him enough in my book.', 'I love Seb but max is a whole different level\nSeb could get flustered, max rarely does', ""Vettel on a good day is A tier.\n\n\nMax's baseline is A+."", 'Vettel even said that Max is better on live television\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/DRseSn-8XEg?si=OJQxN7ztx9cp2Wao', ""I would argue that your point about winning even when the car isn't dominant doesn't apply to Seb. The Red Bull car was clearly the fastest car every year from 2010-13 by varying amounts and especially 2012 there was a title fight when there probably shouldn't have been. Seb clearly needed a car under him that he was comfortable with. I don't deny was very good when he had the car but we've seen time and time again the wheels fall off when the wasn't to his liking. I will die on the hill that 4 titles flatters Seb and he's not on the same level as Max.""]",22,27,2024-10-22 07:24:15, Discussion,22,27

I don\'t really see this one, James probably wants him all for Williams. But maybe the sponsor part maybe involves Colapinto\'s paying his release clause?\n* Sainz triggers a clause and leaves to RBR. In that case Colapinto would just get promoted.\n* Earlier in the year Donadoni and Duchessa mentioned that Horner offered James a Swap, Checo for Albon.

Bottas to Mercedes as reserve driver. That’s the one we all know. Bortoleto and Mick are also contenders. Not sure who is ahead of who in the race here. Media is all over the place. I still believe Bottas has a solid chance. \n\nAnd finally this is just a crazy rumour:\n\n- Alex might get tempted by Sauber/Audi for a 3 years deal as I read on social media. This seems very VERY unlikely. That tweet that OP referred to reads “one coming and one going”. That would be Sainz coming and Alex going to Sauber/Audi. So, it aligns? Anyhow. Crazy. But, still counts as a possibility.\n\nEdit: I totally forgot about the Perez/Albon trade that was rumoured at the beginning of the season. \n\n- Alex to RBR, Checo to Williams but then Checo moves to Audi/Sauber for 1 year (last year) and Colapinto stays at Williams promoted from the Academy.

Now that the dust has settled in Austin, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will be deleted. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","['Most people here probably don’t care since it is Alpine, but I feel bad for Gasly’s race. He qualified top of the midfield and ahead of Perez, plus with both Mercs starting near the end was able to start P6. And Gasly was able to hold onto that P6 throughout the first stint. \n\nThen Magnussen in P7 attempted the undercut by pitting early and Gasly tried to cover it off yet somehow Alpine gave him an horribly slow 6.9 second pit stop that both Crofty and Brundle failed to notice on the broadcast. \n\nFrom there Gasly got stuck behind traffic with other medium runners going much longer and his race was pretty much over by that point. He was up in 10th in the final laps but Lawson and Colapinto both got past on the alternative strategy with fresh mediums against his old hards. \n\nAll in all it was a poor race for Alpine with Ocon being spun around Albon at the start of the race too. At least Alpine were wise enough to tell Ocon to steal the fastest lap away from Colapinto before the end of the race to reduce Williams’ lead over Alpine to 4 points for 8th in the constructor’s. But it feels like the Williams has looked faster than Alpine in the last few rounds so it is hard to see Alpine overcoming that deficit with only five rounds left.', ""It cannot be stressed enough how poorly Checo is doing. George Russell started from the pitlane, had a 5 second penalty, and still finished in front of him. How is this possible? Where is it all going wrong for him? \n\nThe F1 community memed that Red Bull would lose the constructor's championship when they refused to drop him over the Summer Break, and now it looks even more likely they're going to slip to THIRD because of him. \n\nAlso, Liam Lawson from the back of the field to points. Good overtakes, great pace, VCARB finally doing something right for one of their drivers. I can't imagine the kind of pressure Lawson would've been under after getting a little chewed out by Fernando Alonso, and then dude comes right back and does some great overtaking and gets two points. You love to see it."", 'Checo went under the radar this weekend. At one point he was behind Colapinto and I assumed he hadn’t pitted yet. Then Crofty said that Perez had pitted 10 laps ago. It took him forever to get past a Williams and he had newer tyres. He’s in a Red Bull. Russell started in the pit lane, finished ahead *and* he had a 5s penalty in all of that as well. I think there was also a point where the commentators said that Perez was going to end up catching the McLarens. I don’t know what pace that was based on but I’m pretty sure he had just gotten past Colapinto at that stage. It’s inexplicable how he continues to put in these kinds of performances and then you get Horner saying that they need Checo to perform because the Ferrari and McLarens are hunting in packs. And it’s like…what were you honestly expecting, it’s not like he was performing well at the time of the contract renewal is it.', 'Ferrari scored 55 points out of the available 59 points in the weekend. Amazing \n\nYuki crumbled under pressure again with the spin and his reaction to Lawson coming in front of him is all people need to know why he should not be promoted to RBR', 'What was up with Sainz’s Ferrari smelling of fuel? The pit wall told him a mode to go to and that was the last I heard of it.', ""Not going to talk about Max vs Lando since there's been endless debates about it on multiple other posts and there will continue to be until Mexico.\n\nFerrari's 1-2 was their most convincing performance as a team since Bahrain 2022 (and Austria that year as well but Carlos engine blew up), once Charles got into the lead he simply drove off into the distance, and Carlos was able to comfortably finish P2 despite boxing early to undercut Max.\n\nGeorge deserves credit for an impressive charge up to P6 despite starting from the pit lane and having a 5 second penalty on top of it. It was the best result he could've got even if he'd started where he qualified.\n\nThe stars of the race were Lawson and Colapinto, both executed the hard-medium strategy to perfection. Lawson should've been DOTD, finishing only behind Hulk in the midfield battle after starting from the back. Colapinto again getting points, and comprehensively outperforming Albon this weekend (on a track he's never been to as well). Lawson has gone a long way towards proving that from a sporting perspective the decision to bring him in for Ricciardo was the right one, and Colapinto might even get himself a 2025 drive with these performances or at the least drive up his stock substantially for 2026."", ""Great performance from Lawson for a first GP in a while. Had solid race pace on hards, would have been nice if he wasn't carrying 60 place penalty and could've had a chance to send it in Q2.\xa0 I get the impression that Yuki can get a bit flustered by having a junior teammate outperform him.\xa0\n\n\nA little disappointed that McLaren made the call to encourage Lando to not give the position back. It looked for all money to be an off track overtake and with not giving it back, it meant we don't get a steward ruling on Max's off track defending.\xa0"", 'For it being Austin, the off the track theatrics were pretty subdued this year. Where was Shaq in an oversized Cadillac driving Leclec to the podium?', ""It's sort of weird that Ferrari were so blazingly fast in race pace. I mean yes, Leclerc got a fantastic start and in clean air he just cruised to victory, but I don't think either Red Bull or McLaren had an answer for Ferrari's pace. They were all close on the hards, but that Ferrari was unbelievably good on the mediums, watching him pull 7 tenths a lap on Max in the mediums was insane. I'm also still shocked that Max managed to finish ahead of both McLarens while being in a slower car. A good race but these cars are already almost as bad as the pre 2022 ones when it comes to racing, even in a car with a significant tire advantage, the dirty air effect seems really bad. Or maybe it's just Norris who's not good at going wheel to wheel."", 'Clearly Hard -> Med was the superior and faster strategy this weekend (Russell, Lawson, Colapinto)']",44,170,2024-10-22 16:29:37, Day after Debrief,5,9

***LWIF1’s Reaction:***

Welp, the season that keeps on giving gifted us once again… I daresay Ferrari pulling out a 1-2 in a slow-burning psychological thriller of a race wasn’t on many folks’ radar (except for mine, given I stacked my fantasy lineup with both drivers, [and u/Derridizzle, whose poster prediction came true).](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g899sj/my_poster_prediction_came_true_i_also_did_the/)

One trend I’ve noticed about races at COTA, at least since 2021, is that they always have this subtle, slow-burning, intense edge to them—often without too much action through the middle portion of the race, but everything comes to life with great fanfare in the closing stages. Gotta love it!

***Personal highlights from Austin include:***

* Franco bossing his way up to P10
* Max’s stout defense against everything Lando threw at him
* Sainz steering away his engine issues to bring home a Ferrari 1-2
* George dancing his way from the pitlane to P6 (and ahead of Checo)
* And my fantasy drivers finishing in a spiffing P1, P2, P4, P5, and P10…

Before we move onto the rest of the week, here be the [post-Austin GP drivers and constructors standings](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8a4s0/drivers_and_constructors_standings_round_19/) as the paddock packs up and heads to Mexico.

# The Drivers’ Mutterings & Musings

The battle for F1’s last available seat in 2025 drags on, and Valtteri Bottas, one of the contenders, is worried: [“I might not be here in 2025”.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g60y2d/valtteri_bottas_is_worried_i_might_not_be_here_in/)

One of Bottas’s adversaries in the battle for that lone seat is none other than the unexpected mid-season rookie who has knocked everyone’s socks off with his performances, Franco Colapinto. And James Vowles is pushing hard to get him into that coveted seat, [stating that “Colapinto should be in F1 in 2025, even if it costs us points.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g788lv/vowles_colapinto_should_be_in_f1_2025_even_if_it/) Silly season ain’t over yet, dear reader.

For a bit of driver news I’d love to see come true but likely won’t, Honda is allegedly pushing Red Bull to [give Yuki Tsunoda (what I think would be a) well-deserved test run.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7blz7/honda_pushing_red_bull_to_give_tsunoda_f1_test_run/) What more does the man need to do to have a shot?!

Not that it *really* matters at this point, but sometime last year… [Christian Horner *guaranteed* Liam Lawson a seat in 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g44633/christian_horner_guaranteed_liam_lawson_2024_f1/), which of course guaranteed implications on their existing driver lineup for both teams. The more beans that spill about the Red Bull/Toro Tauri VCARB driver rodeo, the more of a political, poorly handled mess the whole situation seems. Relatedly, [RB Team Principle Laurent Mekies certainly isn’t happy with how things went down.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7715a/we_should_have_done_a_better_job_team_principal/)

Max ‘Swear Bear’ Verstappen has stated that [he’ll continue dishing out minimal answers in the FIA press conferences](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6461f/max_verstappen_to_continue_giving_minimal_answers/) in protest of their, [as stated by George Russell, “silly”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6jpi3/russell_hopes_for_gpda_talks_with_fia_in_mexico/) swearing fiasco. [Max also dropped a hint as to how the FIA can end this war of words](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6gplg/max_verstappen_protest_to_continue_at_f1_us_gp/)—but will they listen?

For as I’m sure you saw, [McLaren blessed us with a bright’n’shiny splash of chrome in Austin,](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g4a4tc/mclarens_chrome_livery_for_the_2024_united_states/) a throwback to their much-loved chromed-out car from days gone by.

While not as personally exciting, it’d be unfair to swoon over McLaren’s holy chrome special without at least mentioning [Haas’s “screaming eagle” home race livery,](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g468ab/haas_reveals_us_grand_prix_special_livery/) or [Alpine’s Indiana Jones collaboration with Microsoft/Xbox.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g46z1p/road_to_cota_indiana_jones_and_the_great_circle/)

More hints of a messy Red Bull… [Darth Helmut Marko has admitted that the team’s structure is being rearranged](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g39u6z/helmut_marko_admits_red_bull_f1_organisation_is/) (read: the power struggle struggles on).

In a statement that should surprise nobody at all, [Mattia Binotto shared that turning Audi into F1 winners will be like climbing Mount Everest.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g3ezln/bbc_sport_mattia_binotto_says_turning_audi_into/) No shit, Sherlock! Climbing from P10 to P1 (or thereabouts) will take *years*, even with Audi’s impressive racing record, pedigree, and resource… [But perhaps the increased budget cap they’ve been granted will help.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g74dhq/audi_to_be_granted_increased_budget_cap_on/) Here’s to the journey!

***While not a team specific bit of news, all teams will be affected:***

As of next year, [the FIA are doing away with bonus point for fastest lap…](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g5vczi/f1_will_drop_the_bonus_points_for_fastest_lap/) With many coming to the conclusion that this change is in response to Danny Ric’s last lap glory run in Singapore. Hasta la vista! Relatedly, former F1 driver Pedro de la Rosa is quite pleased at the news, [buoyed with confidence and relief that his 2005 Bahrain racing lap record will stand for at least another year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6bjbk/pedro_de_la_rosa_this_gives_me_some_confidence/)

Following in the vein of the above, as the now-finalized 2026 sporting regulations come to light in drips and drabs, [the FIA has increased the requirement for fielding a young driver during free practice from once per season to twice.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g5y1hr/feeder_series_news_the_fia_has_increased_the/) Meaning, each regular driver will have to give up their seat twice per season, rather than just once. Good news for the younglings!

# Technical Tidbits

In all their official officialness, [here’s the FIA’s breakdown of the upgrades each team brought to Austin—and boy, there’s a whole heap of them!](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6k8bn/teams_upgrades_for_the_2024_united_states_grand/)

***Now that some of the smoke has cleared around the accusations of Red Bull having an illegal ride height adjustment system, here’s the state of play:***

Red Bull does indeed have such a system on their car—which has been known to the FIA and other teams for three years. [According to the FIA, no violation has been found.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7by68/erikvharen_the_fia_has_stated_they_have_found_no/) However, courtesy of enough politicking and lobbying from McKaren Team Principle Zak Brown, Red Bull has [agreed on a plan with the FIA to make changes to their car with immediate effect…](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g5ylgd/thomasmaheronf1_red_bull_has_agreed_a_plan/)

And the accepted consensus around all this hubbub is that Zak has been trying to make noise and draw attention away from the fact that McLaren has had to revise *all* of their rear wing specs to remove the “mini-DRS” system they were caught using in Baku—which is illegal. Formula 1 is *so* back, baby!

Should you feel so inclined, you can enjoy F1’s latest episode of [Beyond The Grid with Tom Stallard,](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g4zzhl/tom_stallard_piastris_olympic_silvermedallist/) Oscar Piastri’s Olympic silver medalist race engineer.

[Fashionista Lewis rocked the double denim](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g5upvz/lewis_arriving_for_media_day/) for media day in Austin.

Mercedes’ Team Principle [Toto Wolff appeared on CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g69inu/mercedes_f1_team_ceo_toto_wolff_on_the_business/) (whatever that’s supposed to be) to spill his insider cup of beans on the business of F1, the sport’s success in the US of A, and the growth outlook.

*Push Push!* [Mercedes sponsor WhatsApp collaborated with Lewis Hamilton to create a short film](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6kj3c/push_push_short_film_with_lewis_hamilton/). Naturally, pregnancy jokes were birthed in the comments.

What it instead showed us is a huge disparity in wheel-to-wheel driving skills, which is why it looked like an unfair fight in COTA on one hand, but, on the other hand, it looked like an entertaining match in Silverstone 2019, Bahrain 2022, Austria 2022.

It’s just embarrassing to see Perez driving the way he has,  there’s no arguing that he is the worst performing driver on the grid bar Zhou and that’s a maybe, because we don’t really know how terrible is the Sauber.

The only logical reason to Checo keeping his seat is that RBR wants as much as CFD and Wind Tunnel it can get to work on the 26 car. Having a terrible underperforming driver on the second seat is a sure fire way to do this without getting the risk of being punished.

Im not saying that it was the intent all along, but things have drastically changed for Red Bull in and out of the track, it was an opportunity that presented itself and they jumped on it.

They are in turmoil, lost key personnel, there’s looming and increasing chance that Max leaves and they lost their huge advantage on track.

And it’s pretty obvious to anyone that whom ever gets the new regulations right have at the least a few years of dominance. Right now RBR needs every once of help it can get.

I’m certain that if things kept the same way as last year, Checo would be gone on the summer break.

I really get that Daniel wasn’t lighting the world on fire and I also understand it was time for him to give room for the new generation, but he most certainly deserved a proper send off. A lot more than Checo does.

In a fair world, Checo would be gone after the break, Daniel would have his last races in the first team and give room to Lawson in 25 with Iwasa/Hadjar joining RB.

But alas…","[""TLDR: This guy thinks washed Perez should have been replaced by washed DR.

Max manages to get the best of out of the car even if it’s not good. There were races where RB had a straight line speed in the bottom 3. Checo definitely is way past his best performances, but there’s just no other available option performing better than him post the break this season.', "">The only logical reason to Checo keeping his seat is that RBR wants as much as CFD and Wind Tunnel it can get to work on the 26 car.

*edit: added rule changes 11, 12 and 13, thanks to those who pointed them out!*

*edit: several people requested I make a similar list for Lewis Hamilton. I'll post it tomorrow.*

- - - 

**1. Minimum Age Requirement for F1 Super Licence**

Race: -

Incident: Max Verstappen was signed by Toro Rosso for the 2015 season at just 16 years old, making his F1 debut at 17 years and 166 days—the youngest driver in Formula 1 history.

Rule Change: The FIA introduced new Super Licence requirements effective from the 2016 season. Drivers must be at least 18 years old to be eligible, have accumulated at least 40 points over the previous three seasons in specified lower categories, and have completed a minimum number of kilometers in testing, along with holding a valid road driver's licence.

**2. The ""Verstappen Rule"" – Moving Under Braking**

Race: 2016 Japanese Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen aggressively defended against Lewis Hamilton by moving under braking into the chicane, forcing Hamilton to take evasive action.

Rule Change: The FIA prohibited drivers from changing direction under braking in a way that could cause an avoidable collision. Drivers must not move unpredictably or change direction under braking when defending, and must leave at least one car's width between their own car and the edge of the track when defending.

**3. Expansion of the ""Verstappen Rule"" – Dangerous Defensive Maneuvers**

Race: 2016 Belgian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen made aggressive defensive moves against Kimi Räikkönen, including moving under braking and weaving on straights, leading to safety concerns.

Rule Change: The FIA expanded the rule to penalize any dangerous defensive maneuvers. Drivers are not allowed to make more than one change of direction to defend a position. Any movement that impedes another driver in a dangerous manner is prohibited, and stewards were given increased authority to penalize unsportsmanlike conduct.

**4. Use of Alternate Lines and Track Limits**

Race: 2017 United States Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen overtook Kimi Räikkönen for third place on the final lap by going off-track and cutting inside the track limits at Turn 17.

Rule Clarification: The FIA provided clarifying definitions of track limits and enforced consistent penalties. The track is defined by the white lines; drivers must keep at least one wheel within these lines at all times. Overtaking or gaining a lasting advantage by leaving the track is prohibited. Stewards were instructed to apply penalties uniformly for track limit violations.

**5. Driver Conduct and Physical Altercations**

Race: 2018 Brazilian Grand Prix

Incident: After a collision with Esteban Ocon, Verstappen confronted and physically pushed Ocon multiple times in the FIA weigh-in area.

Rule Change: The FIA strengthened regulations against unsportsmanlike conduct off the track. Drivers must conduct themselves professionally and with respect. Physical altercations can result in penalties such as community service, fines, or suspension, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the sport's integrity.

**6. Formation Lap Overtaking Clarification**

Race: 2021 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton during the formation lap before the race start.

Rule Clarification: The FIA clarified rules regarding formation lap conduct. Drivers must maintain their grid positions during the formation lap unless a car is delayed leaving the grid. Overtaking is only permitted if a car is delayed and others cannot avoid passing it without unduly delaying the remainder of the field. Procedures were clarified to ensure all drivers understand acceptable behavior before the race start.

**7. Clarification on Forcing a Driver Off-Track**

Race: 2021 Brazilian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen defended his position by pushing Lewis Hamilton wide at Turn 4, causing both cars to leave the track.

Rule Clarification: The FIA issued clearer guidelines on overtaking and defending. If an overtaking car is significantly alongside, the defending driver must leave at least one car's width of space. Drivers must not deliberately force another driver off the track. Detailed criteria were provided for stewards to assess incidents consistently.

**8. Technical Regulations on Rear Wings and Parc Fermé**

Race: 2021 Brazilian Grand Prix

Incident: After qualifying, Verstappen touched and inspected Hamilton's rear wing in parc fermé conditions.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced rules regarding parc fermé conditions. Drivers and team personnel are prohibited from touching or examining rival cars during parc fermé. Strict penalties, including fines and sporting penalties, can be applied for violations. Security measures were enhanced, with increased monitoring and enforcement.

**9. Double Yellow Flag Compliance**

Race: 2021 Qatar Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen failed to sufficiently slow down for double-waved yellow flags during qualifying.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced the importance of yellow flag compliance. Stricter penalties were introduced for Verstappen's failing to respect yellow flags.

**10. Brake Testing and Sudden Deceleration**

Race: 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen braked suddenly in front of Hamilton while attempting to let him pass, leading to a collision.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced rules against dangerous driving behaviors. Sudden deceleration or ""brake testing"" that endangers other drivers is strictly prohibited. Procedures for safely yielding positions were clarified, including proper communication protocols between teams and race control. Stricter penalties were introduced to deter such actions.

**11. Restrictions on Post-Race Celebrations and dangerous driving over the Finish Line**
 
(*edit - suggested by /u/SomewhereAlarmed9985)*

Race: 2021 Styrian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen slowed down and performed burnouts or drifted over the finish line to celebrate his victory, which was deemed potentially dangerous.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced regulations prohibiting dangerous driving after the chequered flag, including burnouts and drifting over the finish line. Drivers are required to proceed safely to parc fermé after finishing the race. Post-race celebrations must not endanger other drivers, marshals, or spectators.

**12. Safety Car Restart Procedure Change**

Race: 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen often drew alongside the car ahead during safety car restarts, notably during the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix where he pulled alongside Lewis Hamilton before the restart.

Rule Change: The FIA updated the safety car restart procedures:
Drivers must remain in a single line without overlapping until the race resumes.
Overtaking or drawing alongside another car before crossing the start/finish line after the safety car has pulled into the pits is prohibited.
Drivers cannot gain an advantage by positioning themselves alongside the car ahead during a restart.


**13. Clarification of Pitlane Exit Rules**

(*edit- suggested by user /u/Buffythedragonslayer)

Race: 2023 Monaco Grand Prix

Incident: During the race, Max Verstappen appeared to cross the pit exit line when rejoining the track, leading to controversy over whether he violated the rules.

Rule Clarification: The FIA tweaked the pitlane exit rules to clarify that drivers must not cross any part of their car over the pit exit line when rejoining the track. The updated rule specifies that touching or crossing the line with any part of the car constitutes a violation.

It's interesting. He's pretty detail-oriented. Sometimes you have to help him a little bit to understand what he's feeling and put it into words, but I think he's not too different from Alex (Albon). He's understanding very well and being very sensitive to the car itself, which is very helpful, and even in the simulator, which is very different to the race car, he's always quite detailed and can give us good direction and understand what the limitations are.”\n\n“He loves to talk. You probably see him in interviews. I've been pushing him to try to be concise in his comments. And it's funny, sometimes he gets carried away. I think that's the Latin philosophy, the way you live. You just express yourself a lot. It's very different from what you see in countries like England, where people are more straight to the point. It's very interesting,” he said.\n\nThe French engineer recalled what happened when he first worked with Colapinto in the simulator that the Williams team has at its Grove factory.\n\n“It's something we worked a lot at the beginning, in the simulator sessions. The first time he made a start and stopped, I think I ran out of space to write down his comments. He's more concise (now), he can still work on it,” he said with a chuckle.\n\nJego explained why it is important for Colapinto, or for that matter any Formula 1 driver, to be precise when describing what he feels with the single-seater upon returning to the garage.\n\n“When you do short starts, even in practice, the moments (to talk) are never really long. Maybe you have 90 seconds, two minutes with the driver for a quick chat. Then it needs to be really effective. And I think he's fine with that now.”\n\n“I think it's a good exercise, because if you're able to give feedback that's concise, that means it's also clear in your head. It's getting better, it's getting better. With you (the media), I don't know, maybe the heart speaks more than the head,” he finished.\n\n\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)"", 'Love how the ""talk less"" is nothing to do with his interviews or anything media related.\n\nYet most of the comments are exactly that 😂', ""Did the writer purposefully word the title to be a bit 'clickbaity?

1g9y36u,The Last stand of Defensive driving?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9y36u/the_last_stand_of_defensive_driving/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9y36u/the_last_stand_of_defensive_driving/,2024-10-23,0 days,"The Verstappen-Norris incident has opened a wide debate about what exactly should be allowed from a defending car in the corner phase of a battle.

As things stand , it appears that the car defending a place has the upperhamd in this area especially if they are in the inside. 

They can take whatever line they want as long as they get to the apex first, regardless of how far along side the rival is. We've seen Max in particular benefit from this rule this time at COTA.

Beong on the inside has always been the winning strategy in these types of battles between it in attack or defense. That's why the ""block pass""or ""block defense""  is the most common form of attack/defense in the sport.

A new rule change that forces the inside car to give up a car's width at all times on exit will instantly shift the power to the outside car because the inside line generally compromises exit speed. It'd mean that suddenly no one wants to be on the inside at all.

And it'll make defending almost impossible.

As it stands we already have DRS. It's also against the rules to weave on the straights to break a tow. It's illegal to move more than once in the braking zone as well.

The attacking car has an advantage on the whole straight all the way into the braking zone with our current rules.

The only place where a defending car has any advantage is on the inside of a corner. Where they are allowed to dictate their line on exit as long as  they are ahead at the apex.

Removing this defensive  advantage will make defending positions almost impossible with the rest of the current rule set. All it'll result into is defending cars probably giving up the position even before the braking zone to avoid losing laptime rather than risk penalties.

The only acceptable amendment is probably ensuring that even if you push the other car wide, you must stay within the white line as well.

There has to be an allowance for defending in the sport otherwise passing will become a formality.

Edit : The rules are skewed in favour of attacking cars already, do we actually have to remove the one piece of track where the defending car has the upperhand?

Thoughts?





","['Max himself shown that defensive driving doesn\'t need to be about shoving drivers off the road up until lap 52. And guess what, everyone loved seeing that, smart positioning of the car and forcing the car behind to take suboptimal, but also WITHIN the track lines was a treat for all to watch. On the other hand, if everyone took the rule to the extreme like Max did, there will be no need to try passing on the outside, the only overtakes that are viable will be DRS blasts down the straight that needs to be completed before the corner or down the inside.\n\nF1 does not have a ""defending is too hard"" issue, we\'ve only spent the last decade complaining about how bad the dirty air issue got resulting in very little overtakes.', ""Max performed stellar defence on Lando for several laps without using the full extent of the rules like he did in Norris' penalty incident (in a completely legal if unsporting way).

If the inside line somehow gets too weak, he's welcome to try the outside (nobody ever will, outside of the banked corner in Zandvoort).\n\nAlonso defended from a much faster Perez in Brazil for an uncountable amount of laps without needing to resort to crude divebombs.\n\nYour concern is very exaggerated."", 'You do realize in that the front car can still pick which lane to defend....', 'McLaren messed this up by giving the wrong info to Norris that he was ahead at the apex.

There’s all the ways to do it in terms of generating uncertainty in the other driver, forcing them on to the worse line the long way round and still pushing them to the outside of the track (but not off), you can also simply try to reach the exit as quick as possible making it there before the overtaking car is entitled to room on their outside line (you can still drive them into a wedge essentially, as long as they don’t make it significantly alongside)\n\n>Attacking car has advantage on the whole straight \n\nthis is true although it’s worth noting that the defending car has the advantage throughout the rest of the lap, the drs is supposed to compensate for the dirty air effect.

What happened on lap 52 was different, the guidelines should promote racing in corners and multiple corners.

>When considering what is a ‘significant portion’, for an overtaking on the outside of a corner, among the various factors that will be looked at by the stewards when exercising their discretion, the stewards will consider if the overtaking car is ahead of the other car from the apex of the corner. **The car being overtaken must be capable of making the corner while remaining within the limits of the track.**

People seem to be struggling with this last line. 

This **does not** mean that the car being overtaken will be penalised if they are not able to stay on track on their own. Which is why they chose the wording ""must be **capable** of making the corner"", rather than simply stating that they must make the corner, must remain on track, or that they must remain within track limits. 

The rule actually means that when a car is being overtaken, it must still **be able** to navigate the corner without being forced off track by the overtaking car. Essentially, the overtaking maneuver should not force the overtaken car to exceed the track limits or lose control.

In practical terms, this ensures that the overtaking driver must execute the pass cleanly and safely, allowing the overtaken car enough space to stay within the track boundaries while making the corner. ","['4 more days to go.', 'Brother, I am tired and it’s only Tuesday.', 'The fucking horse is dead, stop beating it!!!', 'Thing is, both portions you posted contradict each other.\n\nIs it required to be ""sufficiently alongside"" in order to deserve space on the outside, or is it only when ahead by the apex?\nThey don\'t even put it in black and white terms what ""sufficiently alongside"" is, because they are nothing more than a bunch of cowards.', ""The problem with this is if you watch them going into the corner and downstraight before the corner Lando is passed to nearly all the way passed Max.

As he if he turns in properly before the corner he is going to turn directly into Max. So he can only go straight, wreck his car, or just attempt to slow down so much it doesn't matter anymore. \n\nThe rules don't actually work. As your synopsis at the bottom is basically saying everything Max didn't do. As he was already overtaken going down the straight and then Max was attempting to repass on the inside going into the corner. He didn't allow Lando the opportunity to cleanly stay within track limits.\n\nThe entire issue is perspective and who you view as in what place at what time As you can argue its Max's place until Lando gets through corner but you could also argue its Lando place as he passed Max on the straight and now Max is attempting to repass lando in the corner. \n\nThe rules need to be better. As both cars have a right to the trackspace. The rules should state the driver on the side has to provide enough room for the driver on the outside to stay within track limits.

Max’s brakes are interesting. It jumps up, but then as he judges that Lando would be ahead at the apex, he lowers the brakes (marked “2”) before reapplying them. This causes his speed to be slightly higher (marked “3”, zoom in) during braking phase, which put him in front at the apex.

By stealth somehow.', ""Like genuinely, if they hadn't pulled that disappearing act in those 3 or 4 races immediately after Monaco Leclerc would be within like 30ish points of Max, and Ferrari would be up there with McLaren for the constructors.

Just made a simple table of head-to-head race results between Nico and his teammates over all his F1 seasons so far. Nico is an interesting F1 driver for me. It's like he is the definition of a premiere midfield driver. When he is teamed with low-tier drivers like di Resta, Gutierrez, Palmer, Magnussen, he beats them handily. But when he is teamed up with drivers who at one time or another in their career became multi-season Driver 2 of top-tier teams like Sainz, Perez, Ricciardo, Barrichello, he gets beat. It's almost like Nico is a good benchmark to test if your driver is good enough to be a Driver 2 for an elite team, but Nico himself seems to not be good enough to be considered in that tier.

I once thought that his record of most races without a podium is a matter of being in a non-podium capable car. Checo did manage to get four podiums as his teammate so it may not be just because of the strength of the car he has driven in his career.

As we know final standing doesn\'t tell the full story.\n  \nI say this because I remember Hulk having a pace advantage over Sainz and beating him with some margin so I checked and sure enough Hulk is placed higher than Sainz in the championship in their full season together. Kind of an oversight to not check the wdc standings no.  The H2H is skewed due to a DNF classified as a finish due to 90% rule and probably some bad strat or error. Hulk did have the pace over Sainz. \n  \nAlso we can\'t really consider Hulk\'s time in the Racing Point as a fair representation as he was a last minute replacement in all scenarios with barely any testing or practice.  \nEven then he outqualified Stroll in both occasions and almost out raced him in 1 if not for the suspectful unplanned pitstop. One race he DNS for an ""engine issue"" as well (yes tinfoil hat conspiracy from my side) .   \n  \nIn his Force India days he was pretty even on race pace with Per, but a better qualifier. They say Hulk was disadvantaged due to the regs at the time which handicapped bigger drivers. I dunno how true this is tho. Regardless, the final H2H with Per just came down to who was in front, neither had a definitive pace advantage over the other. Tho Per was the more aggressive driver which gave him an edge.   \n  \nIn the same vein I\'d say Di Resta wasn\'t all that bad. Hulk was the better driver but DiResta wasn\'t having his ass handed to him.  \n  \nI\'d say the only drivers to beat Hulk is Barichello and Ric. Tho Hulk was beating Ric at the start, Ric was easily better by halfway+ thru the season.', 'This shows he’s in the Sainz/Perez/Ricciardo range. Not bad, really, all race winners. He never was able to pick a team good enough for him to really show off (although was he sometimes shows in the Haas is pretty impressive).', 'Not representative with dnf and dns', 'Why have you included DNF/DNS in the race head to head? It makes 2018 look a lot closer and 2015/16 a lot worse for Hulkenberg because he suffered 11 DNFs in those 2 years compared to Perez’s 2.', ""Head to head race record is possibly one of the most useless stats you can possibly find, especially in the midfield where many teams take risks to score points that they wouldnt otherwise. Risks can go wrong and driver 2 who didnt take a risk took p12 while driver 1 took a risk which failed ended p16. Sure driver 2 takes a win here in the teammate battle but is it one that actually matters? Not really. That meaningless win is worth just as much as driver 1 finishing p6 with driver 2 finishing p11. When the reality is that 8 points are worth a ton for any midfield team and makes a massive difference in the constructors standings, it affects price money, it affects a teams ability to attract sponsors. \n\nTwo much more telling stats would be quali head to head (as this one actually matters and theres not many excuses for consistent losses) and points. Points arent perfect either but certainly better than head to head race results, there is really no good stat for races, maybe average finishing position. \n\nAnd the drivers you group together are questionable. I wouldnt group Barrichello, Perez, Ricciardo and Sainz together. As for Barrichello, this was literally Hulks rookie season, you wouldnt really put too much stock in this one and they only spent a season together. As for Saint, he literally beat Sainz. He beat him in quali and he beat him points wise. How can you call this a win for Sainz when Hulk literally outqualified and outscored him? Even Ricciardo is not entirely fair as the car was shit while Hulk was leaving. Fairly early on because the 2019 car was far worse than the 2018, they spent most of 2019 experimenting in priority for the 2020 car. They often split strategies between the drivers with Hulk often getting the worse strategy as he was the leaving driver, the priority was clear in Canada as Hulk was faster but team orders were made that made sure Hulk stayed behind Ricciardo. Im not saying Hulk is a better driver, that was prime Ricciardo but im saying he wasnt exactly given a fair chance. \n\nThe only teammate we can draw more proper conclusions is Perez as they spent 3 years together. Hulk was a better qualifier but Perez had the race magic, he was better on the tyres and had some really high peaks but overall both were very equally matched. However, this is now 8-10 years ago. Barrichello is long retired, Perez is about to retire, Ricciardo has just driven his final race, Hulk outlasted both, only Sainz is still hot but he's about to drive for Williams and Sainz is the one he actually beat. \n\nHulk is genuinely having one of his best seasons currently and his value is oddly now higher than some of the rivals that beat him. He never won a race, not even had a podium, he probably still is highly motivated"", 'Anyone else read this and just kept thinking about the average scene from idiocracy? \n\nhttps://youtu.be/s3tFv9IOPP0?si=AzzLD807hyR68oMD', 'Hulkenberg vs Di Resta evolved massively across the year. In the first seven races, Di Resta beat him 6-1 in races and 21-7 in points, but then then Hulkenberg turned the tables massively from Valencia onwards, beating him 10-2 in races and 56-25 in points. It’s not clear why there was such a massive swing in form.

First, I want to emphasize that the intention of my previous post was not to single out Verstappen negatively. In fact, I respect Verstappen as an exceptional talent who pushes the boundaries of the sport.

So, by request, here's a deep dive into the rules that have been changed or clarified solely because of Lewis Hamilton's actions.

- - -  

**1. Gaining an Advantage Off-Track Clarification**

Race: 2008 Belgian Grand Prix


Incident: Hamilton cut the chicane while battling Kimi Räikkönen, allowing him to overtake. He let Räikkönen back past but immediately overtook him again at the next corner.

Rule Clarification: The FIA clarified that if a driver gains an advantage by leaving the track, they must not only give back the position but also ensure they do not retain any lasting advantage. Immediate re-overtaking or benefiting from a better position due to going off-track is prohibited. This clarification aimed to ensure fairness in racing duels.

**2. Emphasis on Honesty with Officials**

Race: 2009 Australian Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton and his McLaren team were found to have provided misleading information to the stewards regarding an incident under the safety car involving Jarno Trulli. Initially, Hamilton told the stewards he did not deliberately let Trulli pass, leading to Trulli's penalty. Later, radio transmissions revealed that Hamilton had been instructed to let Trulli pass.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced the requirement for absolute honesty in all communications with the stewards. Providing misleading information resulted in more severe penalties, including disqualification.

**3. Ban on Excessive Weaving to Defend Position**

Race: 2010 Malaysian Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton weaved multiple times on the straight to break the tow from Vitaly Petrov, who was attempting to overtake. This was deemed dangerous and unsportsmanlike.

Rule Change: The FIA expanded the rules on defensive driving, stating that drivers are allowed only one move to defend their position per straight and prohibiting excessive weaving to impede another car. This was introduced to enhance safety and ensure fair competition during overtaking maneuvers.

~~**4. Restrictions on Helmet Design Changes**~~


~~Implemented: 2016 Season~~

~~Incident: Hamilton frequently changed his helmet designs, making it harder for fans, commentators, and officials to identify drivers quickly.~~

~~Rule Change: The FIA introduced a rule starting in 2016 limiting drivers to one helmet design per season, with exceptions for special occasions. This aimed to improve driver recognition.~~

(*Edit: as pointed out by several users, the rule on helmet restrictions was primarily driven by the actions of Sebastian Vettel, rather then Hamilton*)

**5. Reinforcement of Pit Entry and Exit Regulations**

Race: 2018 German Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton aborted a pit stop entry by cutting across the grass to rejoin the track, crossing the pit entry line, which was against the rules.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced existing rules prohibiting crossing the pit entry and exit lines, emphasizing safety concerns. Drivers must commit to the pit entry once they cross the commitment line and cannot rejoin the track. This clarification ensured consistent enforcement of pit lane regulations.

**6. Podium Attire Regulations and Political Messaging**

Race: 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton wore a T-shirt on the podium that read ""Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor,"" highlighting social justice issues.

Rule Change: The FIA updated podium and pre-race regulations to prohibit drivers from wearing clothing with political or personal statements during official activities. Drivers must wear their race suits fully zipped up during podium ceremonies and official interviews. The aim was to maintain political neutrality during official events.

**7. Jewelry Ban Enforcement**

Race: 2022 Miami Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton wore jewelry, including piercings and necklaces, while driving, despite existing regulations prohibiting jewelry for safety reasons.

Rule Enforcement: The FIA decided to strictly enforce the existing ban on wearing jewelry during competition, requiring drivers to remove all jewelry before sessions. This emphasized safety concerns, as jewelry can hinder medical procedures or pose additional risks during accidents.
 

**8. External Assistance Rule Change**

(*suggested by /u/EndiKopi*)

Race: 2007 European Grand Prix


Incident: During the race, Lewis Hamilton crashed and required assistance to be lifted back onto the track using a tractor.

Rule Change: Following this incident, the FIA changed the rules regarding external assistance during races. Drivers are prohibited from receiving outside help (such as tractors or other vehicles) to get back onto the track after a crash. Any external assistance provided during a race would result in penalties, emphasizing that drivers must recover on their own or with help from their team within the pit lane.


- - - 

It's interesting to note that despite his 18 years driving in Formula 1 (so far), it looks like only three rule changes or clarifications have been made solely as a result of Lewis Hamilton's driving.

Feel free to discuss or point out any additional rules I might have missed!","['Now do Schumacher 😂', ""Wasn't there one in 2007 when Lewis came back to the track with the help of a tractor and then the external help rule had to be clarified?\n\nEdit: European GP 2007"", 'Jewelery ban was dope..

Restrictions on Helmet Design Changes**\n\nI'm pretty sure it was Vettel that prompted this.\n\nHamilton may have added things here and there and occasionally wore special helmets for a given race weekend but fundamentally Hamilton stuck with a fairly consistent design for the season\n\nbut it was Vettel who would show up with a completely new and different helmet design each race weekend making it hard for people to identify the driver."", 'Number 5. Was because of Rosberg during the British GP because he could not change gears anymore and his engineer coached him not to use a certain gear anynore and how to skip that gear not Hamilton. Rosberg got a penalty for it that caused the reevaluation and removal of that rule. \n\nHamilton had trouble with the same rule in Baku because he changed a setinh by accident and could not find his way through the software to fix it. But that did not change the rule as Hamilton was not coached and did not recieve a penalty for it.']",2028,333,2024-10-24 10:24:40, Discussion,7,0

In Mexico, there will be a tyres test in FP2. How will it work? Pirelli wrote the following on its website, but it looks a bit difficult to understand. Can someone make it easier to understand the full process? 

>  
The first day of track action, Friday 25 October, will be slightly different to usual. The second free practice session will be entirely given over to validating the softer compounds in Pirelli’s 2025 range (C4, C5 and C6) in what is known as an in-competition test. The session is extended by 30 minutes to 90 and all drivers and teams will have to follow a specific programme established by the Pirelli engineers. Apart from the dry tyre allocation specifically for the Grand Prix (two sets of Hard, three of Medium and seven of Soft, one less than usual), each driver will have two additional sets of tyres: one will be identical to the one available for the weekend, to act as a *baseline*, while the other will be a 2025 prototype *option,* both in terms of compound and of construction – actually the latter already homologated back in September.

>These two sets will not have any sidewall colour bands. The plan is for the programme to include a performance run and a long run for each set, with every team running the same number of laps with the same quantity of fuel on board, dependent on the type of run. The only exception will be in the case of a regular race driver being replaced for FP1 by a young driver. These race drivers will carry out the Pirelli test for 60 minutes of FP2 only and will have an additional set of Medium compound tyres to catch up as much as possible on acquiring data for the rest of the weekend. All the test data will then be analysed by Pirelli engineers to fine tune the characteristics of the compounds prior to the group test in Abu Dhabi, which starts on the Tuesday after the final round of the 2024 championship. It means that teams will have to prepare their cars for qualifying and the race in the space of two hours: FP1 on Friday and FP3 on Saturday.","[""Basically FP2 will be replaced with a tyre test. Pirelli will bring one new type of tyre, intended to replace one of the compounds for next year. For the sake of explanation, let's say they bring the tyres they're planning to use for C2 next year. \n\nEach team will get a set of the current C2 tyres as well as a set of the prototype C2s and will have to do as close to identical runs on each set as possible so Pirelli can compare the behaviour of the prototypes with the existing tyres.\n\nThe only exception is if a driver has missed FP1 because of a rookie. Then they'll get 30 minutes to do whatever their team wants before doing the Pirelli test for the remaining hour."", 'Should really be called Not-Free Practice 2', ""So it seems that the Pirelli test will take all 90 minutes of FP2, each driver will have to do a long run and a short run on a baseline set, which will be a tyre from this year, and then the same on a test set for next year that Pirelli give them. There's a baseline and a test set so that Pirelli can see the difference between this year's tyres and next year's. These run plans are set by Pirelli: numbers of laps, pace, fuel levels etc. to give Pirelli the data they want for the test tyres.\n\nWhen it comes to a driver who is replaced by a young driver in FP1, they'll do a shorter program which will only take 60 minutes, giving them 30 minutes and an extra set of mediums to do some of their usual quali/race prep."", 'Most will go in circles and get changed from time to time', ""I'm guessing this all goes out the window if it rains."", '90 minutes of track action as a lead in to the World Series…Here for it', "">The only exception is if a driver has missed FP1 because of a rookie. Then they'll get 30 minutes to do whatever their team wants **before** doing the Pirelli test for the remaining hour.\n\nafter. This has been changed since last year. And although they could do whatever they like on paper, everyone must return a previously unused set of Mediums after FP2. So they are basically sure to use only those."", 'Thanks a lot. So they will know which tyre they are testing or not?', 'The FPs have always just been Friday Practice to me.\n\n*What about FP3?*\n\nDoes anyone watch FP3']",9,18,2024-10-24 10:24:53, Discussion,0,0

No new PU because of the cost cap, it\'d only improve lap times ""fractionally"" but has big impact financially so the trade is not worth it (info: remember his current PU is fresh having done the Baku race, Singapore weekend and up to Saturday, FP1, Sprint Quali and Race, and only Q1 in Quali).\n\n\n- Q: Why the difference in performance between Sprint Quali and the rest of the weekend?\n\n\nA: Allison\'s guess is that they ran the cars a bit too low, which improve lap times but also makes the car more unstable and sensitive to bumps and cross-winds if you push your luck too much, which they did.\n\n\n- Q: What was Lewis\' suspension issue and was it fixed for the race?\n\n\nA: A bearing holding a wishbone in the front suspension had started to break-up, leading to rear looseness and instability. It was fully fixed for qualifying and the race.\n\n\n- Q: Why did George have to start from the pit lane?\xa0\n\n\nA: After his crash they had to work on the car outside the authorized hours, triggering an automatic start from the pits.\n\n\n- Q: Did the car have the pace to finish on the podium?\n\n\nA: Allison\'s opinion is no, although they had similar pace to McLaren and Verstappen, P6 was the best the car could get, they\'d have just finished closer to the front pack.\n\n\n- Q: Did the upgrades deliver and what were the problems?\n\n\nA: Yes, the expected downforce was there. The data didn\'t show any issues prior to any of the spins. Less time to dial in with one practice session and the spins in FP, George\'s crash and Lewis\' spin on Sunday.\nThey are still excited about the new package and the issues were most likely down to running the car too low, too stiff, compromising the handling beyond what was acceptable.', ""How can James say there was no reason to think Lewis' setup needed to be changed when Lewis himself said his setup needed to be changed because the balance was all over the place?\n\nJust say the engineers all needed to fix George's car and move on, no need for smoke and mirrors."", 'We have Lewis and George at home\n\nLewis and George at home:', 'oh my God I snorted hahahha', 'Lmaooooo', 'Thank you!', ""Lewis wasn't the only one saying that.

1. How everyone is talking with such confidence about them if no one outside the sport is allowed to read them?
2. Why are the FIA hiding the rules the sport we watch is played by?

EDIT - Thanks to folks who worked out what I actually wanted to find! Its the Driving Standards Guidelines

The FIA doens't release these publically but have a goal to do so by 2025.

Before the 2024 season the FIA announced [here](https://www.fia.com/news/fia-drivers-committee-delivers-driving-standards-guidelines-circuit-racing-championships) that these guidelines have been updated and will be incorporated into the sporting regulations for the 2025 season. Annoyingly though they decided not to publicly publish this new document, which is now what they are referencing in stewarding decision documents.

One of the most relevant changes to the Norris-Verstappen incident was the fact that the following line was removed from the ""Overtaking on the Outside"" section:

>The car being overtaken must be capable of making the corner while remaining within the limits of the track

It will be the sole discretion of the Stewards to determine if the driver of a car is “defending a position.”\n\n> So, are we in a world where if Norris had stayed on the track and aborted his move, then Verstappen would have had to give up the place and Norris would have been better off?\n\nFundamentally this would be a lot easier if the full document was published but we have to go off of snippets the media share rather than the entire thing.

But after checking in the [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/en/drivers/fernando-alonso) and [Stats F1](https://www.statsf1.com/en/fernando-alonso.aspx) websites, I've realized that this weekend is NOT his 400th GP start, but rather his 400th GP entered.

  
In reality, Alonso is currently at 396 races started. It's important to clarify that the differences in races entered and races started is marked by the DNS (Did not start), which by its own definition doesn't count as a started race. During Alonso's career there have been 3 DNS.

  
1. Belgium 2001: This one is pretty interesting, since Fernando actually started and did 3 laps before retiring due to a broken gearshaft. In lap 4 there was a massive crash between the Prost of Burti and the Jaguar of Irvine which triggered a red flag. Following the regulations of the time, the first 4 laps were voided, meaning that officialy, Alonso never started the race.

2. USA 2005: Well, this one is mostly known, but after issues with the Michelin tyres during practice, all teams using them pulled in at the end of the formation lap and did not start the race, including Alonso.

3. Russia 2017: Engine issue during the formation lap which forced Alonso to fail to start the race.

  
All of this means that Alonso is currently sitting at 399 entered GPs and 396 started GPs. This weekend will be his 400th **entered race**, and if he manages to start all the following races, **he will start his 400th race in Qatar**.","[""Y'all ruin everything.

And I’d argue in Alonso’s case since he at least started the formation lap of all three races he’s had recorded as a DNS, it’s pretty disingenuous to argue that this weekend isn’t his 400th race.', 'Hmm. \n\nSainz recently had his 200th (200rd? 😄) race and I remember they must have taken his DNS stats into consideration because he started on the exact same race as Max but their 200th races were a few races apart.', ""If you count Sprints (which I know we don't, don't throw hands at me) then he's surpassed 400 even without the DNSs"", ""Technically, and specifically, correct.

The problem was that Max was able to boost his defence by leaving the track. Leaving the track, notwithstanding being forced off by another driver, should NEVER be rewarded by the rule book. \n\nIf Max had stayed within the track, got to the apex first, I have no issue with him not affording Norris space. The problem was staying within the track was not compatible with getting to the apex first. This should have been penalised but is possibly a grey area in the rules', 'I think we all do.

If they decide to be sporadic about their rulings, any rule enforcement, whether old or new, can be bent to fit the situation at hand. \n\nIt's funny how the FIA is willing to put up with the vitriol behind these controversies sometimes.

It’s impossible to write a rulebook that covers every situation perfectly. Stewards should have the ultimate authority in such cases.\n\nTake the Lando and Max situation, for example. Lando had the better run into the corner, and if telemetry shows he would have made the corner if Max hadn’t forced him off, then it’s clear-cut. If Max eased off his brakes more than usual to stay ahead and caused the contact, it’s simple: give Lando 5 seconds for overtaking off track and Max 5 seconds for forcing him off. The penalties cancel each other out, and they race on.\n\nThe rule about being ahead at the apex is fine, but Max’s move wasn’t “in the spirit of the rules.” Formula 1 has used that term before—why not apply it to driving? If you manipulate your braking just to be ahead, you’re not following the spirit of the apex rule and should be penalized.\n\nI don’t see why the FIA needs to complicate things by searching for black-and-white rules for every situation.', 'I know it\'s so much easier said than done and would possibly come with it\'s own set of problems, but surely putting gravel traps at the exit of virtually every turn at every track would aleviate the grievances everyone has with track limits. Very simply, if you go off track limits, the track itself will penalize you for it, and if you get pushed off, well I feel it would be quite clear and the offending car simply gets a quick penalty for it. No need to change any rules, no need for different stewards to interpret the somewhat vague rules in different ways, just very clear ""off track is bad, dont go there"". Again I know it\'s probably easier said than done but i do wonder if there are other methods which could solve this whole discussion as effectively']",290,94,2024-10-25 21:22:46, News,5,-1

1gbsett,Surprisingly few: All the F1 rules changed or clarified because of Sebastian Vettel since 2007,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbsett/surprisingly_few_all_the_f1_rules_changed_or/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbsett/surprisingly_few_all_the_f1_rules_changed_or/,2024-10-25,0 days,"Earlier threads:
https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9dt5h/with_calls_for_new_rule_changes_after_verstappens/
https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga7lqk/by_request_i_also_compiled_all_the_f1_rules/

After compiling lists of rule changes and clarifications prompted by Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton, several users suggested I create a similar breakdown for Sebastian Vettel. However, in researching Vettel’s career, I discovered that while he was certainly involved in high-profile incidents, relatively few resulted in formal rule changes or FIA clarifications directly because of his actions.

In fact, only two racing incidents directly led to regulatory changes or clarifications. 

- - - 

**1. Team Orders and the “Multi-21” Incident**

Race: 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix

Incident: During the final stages of the race, Red Bull instructed Vettel to hold his position behind teammate Mark Webber using the ""Multi-21"" code. Ignoring the directive, Vettel overtook Webber, leading to significant tension within the team and sparking wider debates on team orders in F1.

Rule Discussion: Although the incident did not result in a formal rule change, it led the FIA to reinforce its stance that team orders were permissible within teams but that the enforcement was up to the teams themselves. This set a precedent for how team orders would be handled going forward, emphasizing FIA neutrality in intra-team directives​.


**2. Helmet Design Restrictions**

Year Introduced: 2015

Incident: Known for debuting new helmet designs almost every race during his time with Red Bull, Vettel’s constant changes created issues with driver recognition, particularly for fans and officials who sometimes found it difficult to identify him on track.

Rule Change: To enhance driver visibility and consistency, the FIA implemented a rule limiting drivers to a single primary helmet design per season, with allowances for one special event helmet. This rule was a direct response to (mostly) Vettel’s frequent design changes and aimed to maintain a consistent look for each driver throughout the season.​
​

**3. Track Re-Entry Safety**

Race: 2019 Canadian Grand Prix

Incident: Leading the race, Vettel ran off-track under pressure from Hamilton. When he rejoined, his manoeuvre forced Hamilton to slow to avoid a collision, leading to a five-second penalty that cost Vettel the race win and sparked intense debate about fair re-entry practices.

Rule Clarification: The FIA responded by clarifying its rules around track re-entry, specifying that drivers must rejoin the track safely without impeding others or forcing them to change their racing line. This clarification helped to set clearer expectations for safe re-entry in similar scenarios going forward​.
​

**4. Advocacy for Consistency in Stewarding**

Years: 2020-2021 (Various races)

Incident: Over multiple races, Vettel vocally criticized inconsistencies in stewarding, especially concerning track limits, penalty decisions, and race director judgments. His frustration highlighted the need for uniform rule enforcement and drew attention to the impact of inconsistent decision-making on race outcomes.

Rule Discussion: Although this advocacy didn’t lead to any specific rule change, it fueled discussions around fairness in penalty application and contributed to a broader movement for consistent rule enforcement. The FIA ultimately restructured its approach to race direction following the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, suggesting that Vettel’s efforts may have nudged F1 in a more consistent direction​.


**5. Concerns About the Virtual Safety Car Loophole**

(*edit: added after suggestion by /u/cafk)*

Year: 2021

Incident: Vettel voiced concerns about drivers exploiting loopholes in the VSC system, specifically how some were gaining an unfair advantage during race situations. He emphasized the need for clearer rules to maintain fair competition.

Rule clarification: Following his remarks, the FIA acknowledged these concerns and committed to reviewing and addressing the VSC system to close any loopholes, showcasing how Vettel's advocacy influenced ongoing discussions about rule enforcement in F1.

- - - 


To give a fuller picture, I’ve also included some debatable cases where Vettel’s actions sparked discussions or reinforced existing rules but I believe did not prompt specific rule changes or clarifications.

**Debatable Incidents Not Included:**

**1. Multi-Weaving in Defensive Moves**

Race: 2012 Italian Grand Prix

Incident: Vettel’s defensive move at Curva Grande pushed Fernando Alonso off-track, leading to a drive-through penalty.

Reason Not Included: The penalty reinforced the “one-move” rule in defensive driving but did not prompt a new rule or a further clarification on defensive tactics.

**2. Collision with Hamilton Behind Safety Car**

Race: 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Incident: Believing Hamilton had brake-checked him, Vettel collided with Hamilton under the safety car and pulled alongside to express his frustration, which led to a time penalty.

Reason Not Included: Although it reinforced standards of sportsmanship under caution, it did not lead to a formal rule change or clarification. The FIA upheld existing standards on conduct during the safety car without redefining them.

**3. Overtaking on Pit Lane Entry**

(*edit: added after suggestion by /u/cafk)*

Race: 2016 Chinese Grand Prix

Incident: While entering the pits, Vettel overtook ~~Daniil Kyvat~~ Jenson Button and Carlos Sainz on the pit lane entry, highlighting an ambiguous area in the rules regarding overtaking in non-race conditions like pit lane entry.
Outcome: Although Vettel’s maneuver raised questions and sparked discussion about whether overtaking should be restricted in the pit entry area, the FIA chose not to issue a clarification or rule change at the time.

The only viable solution to provide more opportunities for F2 drivers is to expand the number of teams or mandate each team to run three cars, with one designated exclusively for rookies. However, the latter option raises a dilemma: what happens if the rookie proves to be as capable as the two main drivers? Another proposal is to implement stricter licensing requirements, establishing higher standards that drivers must meet to continue racing in F1. Yet, this could be counterproductive, as a driver's performance often hinges on the quality of the car.

Certainly by the second half of the year the difference in performance between Williams and Ferrari was small enough that Schumacher's talent advantage could make up the difference.\n\nWilliams actually had to pause development on their 1998 car to bring upgrades to the FW19 to prevent the title slipping away, which also explains why the 1998 car ended up so undercooked."", ""Yes, he made a few mistakes, but still smashed his team mate. Hyper focusing on mistakes loses the full picture, because despite the mistakes his best performances make up for it. \n\nI think, herein lies the crux of the issue. Villeneuve loses from being compared to Schumacher. Obviously Schumacher was the best driver in 1997 by a clear margin, but that doesn't mean Villeneuve didn't have a strong season himself.

Each position lost gains a significant extra chunk of wind tunnel runs and CFD time. Is this enough of a benefit for 2026 that it outweighs the financial penalty of finishing further down the table and thus means Sergio's lack of performance is being left unaddressed?

I know folks talk about sponsorships and merch because of Checo, and maybe some talk of a good number 2 who won’t cramp Max’s style. 
That being said. 
How does all this equate to making it worthwhile keeping him? Losing constructor championship is huge and completely on Checo.

Dietrich Mateschitz's passing. Guy controlled the 49% of the Red Bull GmbH and was avid in his support for RBR and Motorsport. He wanted the team to win no matter the costs. After his passing, a power vacuum between his heirs and the Yoovidhya family of Thailand (51% ownership in RB GmbH) was created. Byproduct to that was the whole Horner/Marko fall out and RBR civil war that costed them Newey (among others). Apparently, the Thais aren't fond of F1 and intended on getting rid of RBR. So, (this one is an assumption) between Perez's sponsorship, Honda/Ford money, Oracle main deal and the rest, RBR has managed to become sustainable without major investment from Red Bull GmbH, leading to the Thais keeping the team around."", 'weraceasmoney', 'Money talks', ""It's probably worth pointing out that the reason he got the seat in the first place was because the guy legitimately was pretty good in his previous teams. He compared favourably to Hulkenberg and Ocon in Force India (as well as Stroll but eh) but in 2021 he learned that he was going to get booted off the team for Sebastian Vettel in the wake of the upcoming rebrand to Aston Martin. At the time people were legitimately disappointed to hear this, and in the 11th hour of the 2021 season, after completing a last to first challenge win in Sakhir, he ended up getting the Red Bull seat. Albon was in RB at the time and his performances were pretty bad too.\n\nIn 2021 and 22 he wasn't exactly brilliant but he was good enough in comparison to what had been seen from Albon and Gasly before. The true downfall happened somewhere around Miami 2023, where after a strong start to the season and with Red Bull dominating the field, he started believing a title fight was possible. That race he started on pole while Max couldn't set a time and was 9th, and ended up still losing the race to Max. It was mostly after that he started performing really badly.\n\nI suppose it's after that, for me, that the money question really starts setting in, as by the time his bad performances became truly blatant, he was already a household name in the latam market and bringing in all sorts of sponsorships in addition to his old friend Carlos Slim.""]",0,108,2024-10-27 18:29:37, Discussion,0,6

Then, misteriously, Liam Lawson is called to pit and along with a new wing (due to damage from a collision with Colapinto) they put him on softs and send him to try for the Fastest Lap.

Lawson, if I'm not mistaken, is driving for VCARB, a team that's not fighting for championship points and won't benefit in any form from a change in the Constructor's Championship standings. He also wouldn't get the point for Fastest Lap since he was 17th at this point in the race. Seems like the only objective was to take away that point from Norris/McLaren.

1 lap later, the Red Bull people seem to have realized they made a mistake (or maybe the radio connection between RB and VCARB was down, who knows) and promptly send Checo to pit for softs and try for the Fastest Lap, which makes complete sense since RB is fighting for the Championship and any point they can take away from McLaren or Ferrari is vital.

Am I the only one thinking this is a load of horseshit? I know I might sound like a Karen and it's not the first time Red Bull does something like this but this one was very blatant, and it had the awful side effect of putting Checo dead last in his home race (it's not like he was in a good position before, but he finished LAST, lol) I know it's a competition and no one wants to lose and there's money involved yadda yadda but c'mon, if it's gonna be like this just run a 4-car team and call it a day.","[""If he's getting a new front wing he may as well get new tires, and what tires did you expect them to put on at that point in the race?

Given Lando's pace at the end, the time loss against Verstappen, and any potential damage, it's not unreasonable to think Norris could have won this race with Verstappen 4th, behind the two Ferraris and Lando. If this happened, Verstappen would have dropped 13 points. Instead, he loses just 10 points to Lando. I appreciate it's not a huge difference, but it makes me wonder if it was part of his mindset going into this race.

Edit: I know we saw similar with Hamilton in 2021 as well. Should this lead to discussions about the time of penalties awarded? Should time penalties be served sooner (like the old 3 laps to serve a stop/go), should you be allowed to change tires at the same time?

Like Lando said before, Max doesn’t care where he finishes, as long as he makes it as hard as possible for Lando', ""It's arguable whether he would have caught Sainz without being held up, but it was clear that his priority was fucking Norris race at all costs and he was happy to crash as long as it was with Lando"", 'I agree; not giving back the position probably did keep Norris from having enough laps to win by the end, whilst only costing himself 1 place at most, given that Max still gets at least one of his penalties, and he probably realised he was getting at least one penalty.', ""Tbf I think Red Bull fucked up pitting Max so early whilst he was holding up Lando.

1gdmvx6,How on earth can RB retain Perez in 2025?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gdmvx6/how_on_earth_can_rb_retain_perez_in_2025/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gdmvx6/how_on_earth_can_rb_retain_perez_in_2025/,2024-10-27,1 days,"

By now, there shouldn't be any smidgen of doubt that RB needs to part with Checo Perez.
He is not able to extract any sort of performance from the RB20.
It's getting ridiculous how big the gap has become with Max... and the rest of the field.

Realistically, I think there's only two options: either promote Lawson or Tsunoda to RB.
Tsunoda in that respect is, although talented,  bit erratic in his driving as of late.
Lawson on the other might be the best choice IMO. Of course he's not that experienced yet (so there's always the danger of a Gasly, Kvyat or Albon scenario at RB), but he drives calmly and smart.

A swap with one of them is not an option I think for Perez. That would be an embarrassment, frankly.

What do you think?","[""They can't.\nIf they keep him, Max is 100% not winning the championship.\nThey can't handle 2 competing McLarens and Ferraris with no backup driver support."", ""Maybe Checo can stay because he gets faster, or has Horner's leaked toe photo.\xa0"", 'Such a performance on a home race must be absolutely ridiculed. No excuses left, I can’t imagine what RB is thinking.', 'Ricciardo was binned so Lawson could audition. If he does well enough he will drive a red bull in 2025.', 'They should’ve signed sainz when they had the chance', 'Just for the hype Danny Ric should have finished this season there is no reason to keep Perez apart from money', 'They absolutely can’t… he’s costing the teams millions, literally… third in a drivers championship they could’ve won is losing them a fortune\n\nAnd redbull needs to look at the future… Max is very clear that he won’t stick around when he would be considered old, he’s not a fernando or a lewis… Redbull needs someone to take over the team when Max leaves… they can’t afford to wait till Max is gone to start looking for a new potential world champion', 'Too late now,, they made their bed. They could have had literally else in that car by now but I guess they think the money must be worth having a bottleneck. Like, how badly managed do you have to be to have two teams and somehow still not enough seats because one of the big ones has to go to a pay driver. Fuck that felt good, this forza ferrari thing feels great lol', 'My guess is that Perez is still there because there might be a slight possibility that Max might leave if they loose both titles. On the surface everything looks fine at Redbull but below that is probably lots of discontent with how things are going and the drama from the start of the year is also still lingering.\n\nI still see Max out if he looses the WDC either still to another team which boots one of their current drivers or taking a sabbatical or even retire with all the bullshit going on recently with the FIA etc.\n\nSo Redbull hang on to Perez as they can use the cash and they do want atleast one driver in 2025 who knows the team and the car so they can better prepare for 2026.\n\nBut lets see maybe im wrong but I still have the feeling we have not seen all from what still is awaiting Redbull ones the titles are both lost and the infighting really starts.']",301,216,2024-10-28 22:22:49, Discussion,7,2

This is de Zordo's first year, behind a new Principal, and he has delivered the goods with the upgrades Haas has received all year.  Komatsu is doing a great job as principal, but I wanted to shoutout de Zordo too because Komatsu can keep the team organized and all pulling in the same direction, and that's great, but without competent technical direction it's hard to imagine a team going from P10 to P6 with as few resources to work with as Haas has.

With Simone Resta, the relatively well-regarded technical chief from previous years, moving on to greener pastures at Mercedes this year, it would be easy to imagine Haas technical direction taking a step backwards this year.   De Zordo has filled that gap nicely, delivering a very clean set of upgrades that has consistently permitted his team to perform well ahead of the team's median expectations, with nearly every upgrade added to the car resulting in at least a few more points for the team as a whole.  For a team fighting from the back into the midfield, that's an impressive accomplishment.

For the team with the fewest developmental resources in Formula 1, Haas has performed way above their own heads at key times this year, and while Komatsu deserves a large share of the laurels for that, and some credit is due to the drivers as well, de Zordo and his team should not be forgotten.","['Haas and Ferrari did a great job fixing their tire wear issue over the winter.', 'Really makes you wonder how hard Steiner was holding the team back.', 'Nice to meet you Andrea x', 'Shoutout Ferrari', 'Is this a self-advertisement?', 'Remember when in testing people were saying Haas should be kicked out because they were 5 seconds off the pace?

If Sainz hadn’t missed Jeddah, it’s likely he would be 5th in the championship in what has been the best car over the season.

I don’t think he’s had a good weekend on outright pace since summer break, except maybe Monza.

1ge2yhu,Is Ocon one of the winners of the silly season?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ge2yhu/is_ocon_one_of_the_winners_of_the_silly_season/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ge2yhu/is_ocon_one_of_the_winners_of_the_silly_season/,2024-10-28,0 days,"I know it is early but seeing the Haas cars both get points without any major drama or luck yesterday made me wonder about their potential next year.

I realize every track is different and Haas will likely not get to the points in every race for the rest off the season but their upward trend seems obvious. I do not have a deep technical understanding but a lot of people seem to view the 2025 season as an extension of 2024 when it comes to car development due to no rule changes and the maturity of the current rule set. Based on that Haas is probably in a better position for next year than they have been in at least 5 years.

Back to Ocon. On the face of it, he had a horrible season. He lost the power battle within Alpine to his arch rival, was publicly demoted to nr 2 and then announced not to be extended. It seems like he was lucky that Haas offered him a seat at all (although i personally believe he is a solid choice and deserves a seat in F1). In previous years, a change from Alpine/ Renault to Haas would have been a strong demotion, but since this year it is actually a bit of a promotion?! Haas has more than 3x the points of Alpine and the whole saga around the Alpine engine does not seem like they will calmly work to improve the car again?

Long story short: Did Ocon lose his seat to luck into a significantly better team next year? Sort of the reverse Sainz?","['Getting your hopes up for HAAS crushing it next season is a good way to get hurt.', ""Ocon was actively trying to leave Alpine. They basically announced they were not extending a driver who didn't want to extend with them in the first place. \n\nI'd say, probably, from his point of view just getting away from Alpine was a win. Haas performing better than Alpine is just a nice bonus."", 'Never completely trust Haas.', 'Not sure what to think about Ocon and Alpine. I mean alpine let him go and Monaco was probably a good excuse at that but reports were that Ocon had been shopping around even before the 2024 season started. \n\nI really would like to know what happened between Ocon and Alpine because he got a 3 year contract in 2021 and things seemingly were on the up. I think Ocon was just glad to get out of Alpine and the relationship has clearly suffered. \n\nHe even said very recently that he’s lost enjoyment for racing and is just going through the motions at this point. Alpine themselves have lost out on, in my opinion, the best midfield pairing on the grid. Gasly and Ocon are two drivers who I’d want if I was leading a team in the midfield and I’m not sure if Doohan is really a great replacement but we can only see until he’s in that car. \n\nBack to the original point, Haas are doing well and Komatsu has done a great job however we don’t know whether that will correlate to next year. They’re on a good trajectory but they also were in 2018 and then produced a car that was a tyre shredder in 2019. If Haas continue to be on a good trajectory and produce a car that starts challenging the top 4 teams then yes, Ocon is a huge winner out of all of this.', ""If Haas can keep this trajectory going then I'd say he's the winner of silly season, not just one of. It'll be the definition of failing upward.\n\nBig if though but Alpine aren't going anywhere positive either."", 'Trusting in Haas not to cock it up is quite brave', 'Three teams on the grid you must never trust even if they show form and signs of having gotten their shit together:\n\n1. Ferrari\n\n2. McLaren \n\n3. Haas', 'The midfield is forever in flux.\n\nAlpine’s said their 2025 car is completely different, and the upgrades they brought at COTA are part of their 2025 development. They’re taking home a lot of windtunnel time as well to develop their car. They’re also taking the Merc engine for 26, which is supposedly the best available for those reg’s.\n\nHaas is having a really good year this year. But we don’t know if they’ll further progress for next year, if they’ll slip back, or stay the same. They’re having less windtunnel time than they’re used to next year.\n\nCould be either of them, and then it could all change again for 26. Personally I’d bet on Alpine long term out of the two. \n\nI also think there’s security in Gasly’s position (being the only french thing left in the french national team) which should help him extend if he doesn’t get other offers. Meanwhile Ocon is more vulnerable to this being his last contract by not having those kind of ties, plus Merc who he’s tied to has passed him over once again.', ""Reminder that Alpine were considerably better than Haas have been this year.\n\nMidfield teams crossover from season to season is the most volatile thing in F1.

Jokes aside, how do these meetings pan out? What kind of plans do they discuss?

Last year we were just zero flexible and we couldn't do anything with our racing so it looked like we were not getting the strategy right a lot of times.

# The Mexican Grand Prix



**Qualifying:**

P1. Carlos Sainz

P2. Max Verstappen

P3. Lando Norris



**Grand Prix:**

P1. Carlos Sainz

P2. Lando Norris

P3. Charles Leclerc



***LWIF1’s Reaction:***

Good lord F1 has been spicy. Unless Red Bull pulls a purple’n’blue rabbit outta their butts and manages to unlock a sizeable pace advantage over McLaren AND Ferrari *right now*, I’d wager we’re in for ever-increasing spiciness in the closing rounds. Lando’s WDC bid looks to be losing steam, at least if you consider how the amount of points he needs to gain in each race is growing rather than shrinking. Say what you will about Max’s boundary-breaking defensive tactics, but they’re proving effective—and highlighting how cunning and calculating he is… Talk about being 10/10 villain.

***Personal highlights from Mexico include:***

* The most action-packed, entertaining, dare I say *cinematic* Mexican Grand Prix in recent memory (and possibly ever?) 
* Carlos Sainz reclaiming his coveted P1 from Max with a classy overtake, then steaming off into the distance, presumably powered by chilis.  
* Contentious (and rather pissy) wheel-to-wheel action through the pack.  
* A double points finish for Haas, vaulting them into P6 in the WCC.  
* And more fuel for the driving standards fiery war of words…

\~\~\~

# The Drivers’ Mutterings & Musings

*The hottest talking point coming out of Austin and Mexico is the latest flare-up about racing standards between drivers (courtesy of Max Verstappen’s stout defensive maneuvers against Lando Norris).*

*General consensus seems that Max has been toeing the line of how the existing rules and standards are laid out—but that said existing rules and standards are part of the problem in not supporting hard and fair racing, while leaving a lot open to the interpretation of drivers and stewards alike.*

*Hence the outpouring of statements about* [*how Austin exposed the flaws in F1’s driving standards*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9cvfm/how_austin_exposed_the_flaws_in_f1s_driving/)*,* [*calls for a racing regulation overhaul*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9eo4u/jenson_button_calls_for_fia_rule_change_after/)*, and the current rules being* [*a blueprint to dissuade overtaking.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9eo4u/jenson_button_calls_for_fia_rule_change_after/)

*If you’d like to better understand these mysterious racing regulations,* [*this article courtesy of The Race is your best bet*](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/little-known-new-f1-rules-already-affecting-racing/)*, given the FIA chose not to make their 2024 regulations publicly available, unlike in years gone by.*

*Meanwhile, Mulletman Bottas has taken a simpler view,* [*claiming that some drivers are taking the piss outta the racing regulations…*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbah1i/valtteri_bottas_claims_some_drivers_taking_the_p/) *Fair enough VB!*

*Relatedly… On the heels of the above, Investigative Redditor* u/stetoe [*put together this brilliant post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9dt5h/with_calls_for_new_rule_changes_after_verstappens/) *compiling all of the F1 rule changes that have occurred since 2016 as a direct result of Max doing Max things.*

*(For those fascinated and eager for a follow up, by popular demand* u/stetoe *cobbled together similar posts as above,* [*but for rules changed due to Lewis Hamilton,*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga7lqk/by_request_i_also_compiled_all_the_f1_rules/) *as well as for* [*the changes triggered by Sebastian Vettel)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbsett/surprisingly_few_all_the_f1_rules_changed_or/)*.*

***Okay, let’s move on from the driving standards rabble-babble:***

Fernando Alonso started his 400th Grand Prix in Mexico (pretty impressive for a rookie, if I may say so), [celebrating the occasion with this lovely special lid.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8s0xp/fernando_alonso_will_start_his_400th_f1_gp_in/)

In celebration of his time-bending achievement, Young Fernando appeared on F1’s Beyond The Grid podcast to discuss [why—and how—he’s still fired up for racing in Formula 1 after 400 races](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga67mt/fernando_at_400_why_alonsos_still_fired_up/) (hint: he might be a vampire).

Thanks to his dynamite opening performances, there’s a [“carambola (which means *lucky chance* in Argentine Spanish) for Franco Colapinto to be on the grid next year.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8w9ma/virutasf1_there_is_a_carambola_for_franco/) In order for that to happen though, there’ll have to be driver movement elsewhere on the grid—as well as sponsors who will have a say.

*Aaaaand apparently* [*Franco has an offer on the table from Red Bull:*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gckaxb/sky_italia_f1_drivers_market_future_of_colapinto/) For which team and seat we know not. The hang-up, of course, is that Williams would have to release or loan Franco to a team they’ve got eyes on competing with soon… But JV did say the other week that he wants Franco on the grid, regardless if that means Williams loses points as a result. So who knows!

Pundit Lawrence Barretto claims that [“Valtteri Bottas is in good shape to retain his Sauberaudi seat, but F2 championship leader Gabriel Bortoleto is still under consideration”.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gahgbl/lawrence_barretto_i_understand_valtteri_bottas_is/) I say give me another rookie or give me death!

However, returning for another with Sauberaudi isn’t Valtteri’s only option, apparently. [Lawrence also reports that Bottas is in talks with Mercedes to return in a non-racing role as a back up](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbamaw/lawrence_barretto_valtteri_bottas_says_his/) (meaning reserve, I presume). 

And given we’re on the Americas leg of the season, the annual [“Sergio Perez is in trouble and perhaps on his last legs”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gauy46/contract_warning_for_sergio_perez_after_lawson/) rumours are bubbling up from the underworld. I’ll report on them due to his woeful trend of underperformance, but definitely, absolutely, certainly take them a spoonful of salt or two.

*However, his dearth of performance in Mexico won’t help matters.*

For another rumbling to take with a spoonful of salt (sadly), at Honda’s ~~incessant pressuring~~ behest, [Yuki Tsunoda seems to be *finally* getting a Red Bull test in Abu Dhabi this year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb956m/lawrence_barretto_yuki_tsunoda_says_theres_a_good/) Much as I’d love to see him have a season in the car, I think we all know this won’t go anywhere though :(

\~\~\~

# The Teams’ Twistings & Turnings

The War of Words between McLaren and Red Bull has been quick to return to boil, with [Lando throwing some shade at Max](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8rtba/but_the_rules_are_the_rules/) (and the FIA). In blithe response, [Max noted that McLaren have been “complaining a lot lately.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8l92a/mclaren_complain_a_lot_lately_says_verstappen_as/)

Meanwhile, Master Shit-Stirrer [Toto Wolff called Red Bull’s contentious ride height adjustment device “outrageous” and laughed at their “Bugs Bunny” tool.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8mzbk/wolff_labels_red_bull_bib_device_outrageous/) In a cantina somewhere in Mexico City, Zak Brown was seen furiously scribbling notes on “how to stir the pot without being labeled a Karen…”

\~\~\~

# Technical Tidbits

In a move that all fans are sure to hate if this results in what I expect it will, [Duracell has become F1’s first DRS Zone sponsor in Las Vegas.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8sz6d/duracell_becomes_f1s_first_drs_zone_sponsor_in/) I can hear the calls now… *“Max Verstappen enters the Duracell DRS Zone, which will surely help him stay ahead of Lando Norris for at least one more lap.”* If this pans out like Tissot’s sprint race sponsorship in MotoGP, you *will* hear “Duracell” every time the camera feed moves through this section of track.

If you, like everyone at Mercedes I presume, are tired of the ride height shenanigans of this current generation of cars, [you’ll be thrilled to know that F1’s 2026 regulations will leave behind the current ride height nightmares.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga76b3/why_f1s_2026_rules_will_shake_off_rideheight/)

# Paddock Playtime

I’m not sure how this video was allowed to escape the Red Bull garage, [so get a load of what a current F1 car looks like under the skin while you still can.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb68a0/formula_aerodynamics_so_much_technology_fudo2/)

Williams and their new partner Mercado Libre (courtesy of Young Gun Franco Colapito) put together [this fun little commercial](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb2gp5/mercado_libre_commercial_revealing_the_new/) revealing their special livery for Mexico and Brazil.

Lando stands out. 4 losses after starting in pole in a good enough mclaren.

I'd love to hear some people's suggestions on how a better rule could be written. It might also be useful to the discussion for others to poke holes in suggested rules, to see how they could be gamed. Maybe ultimately we can come up with something better...

IMO rules should be very simple to understand in the heat of battle, but also very clear cut to enable easy decision making by the stewards.","['Send it. Let the gods decide.', '""Just do it""', 'Just leave it the way it is with one amendment.  Any car that has established their position with their front tires at minimum in front of the rear tires of the opposing car, either on the inside or the outside of another car, prior to the breaking zone, is entitled to enough space to remain on the racetrack alongside the opposing car throughout the corner or until the leading cars rearmost point is in front of the trailing cars forward most point.', 'Maybe stay on the track.\nLegal defending must remain within track limits or lose position', "">How would you write a better overtaking rule?\n\nI wouldn't.\n\nThe problem is that as soon as you codify what overtaking is in the rules, you'll get teams challenging everything that falls outside that definition. And there's often going to be scenarios that arise where you cannot address them.\n\nTake, for instance, the incident between Verstappen and Norris at Turn 4 in Mexico. Norris was slightly ahead of Verstappen going into the corner. Does that mean that he had completed an overtake? No -- as we have seen on countless occasions, you need to be a good way ahead of another driver to overtake around the outside there. But if Norris had been on the inside of the corner, he would need to be much less further ahead of Verstappen to make that pass work. So straight away we have a corner where the criteria for judging the success of an overtake is different depending on the position of the cars on the track. You can't write a rule to address that, because then you'd have to write a rule to address every position going into every corner on every circuit. And that's before we even consider the presence of Sainz in the Turn 4 incident -- he was going through a slow apex when Verstappen and Norris arrived. Verstappen's choices were a) brake hard, b) hit Sainz, or c) take a more shallow line to avoid contact. He chose the third option, which on balance was probably the best option since braking hard risked a lock-up and hitting Sainz was never an option.\n\nThe vast majority of responses to the proposal of writing rules around overtaking seem to have one thing in mind: creating a scenario were Norris can get ever-so-slightly ahead of Verstappen, and thus requiring Verstappen to immediately concede the position."", 'Both cars stay within track limits. \n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.', '*Attacker* : How bad do you want the position? \n\n*Defender* : How bad do you want to keep the position?', 'No contact, no penalty\n\nLet there be chaos', ""If the attacking car has their front wheel alongside the mirror (the defending car can see this) of the defending car by corner entry then they must be given racing room at the apex and exit as long as any part of their car remains alongside the defenders car. Both cars must be able to stay within track limits at all times.\n\nI personally don't think the current guidelines are that bad, but they key to any set of rules or guidelines that are applied to racing is going to be a consistent interpretation and enforcement of those rules. I don't think that happens without a permanent set of stewards who are given a clear mandate of what they are supposed to be looking for (are they supposed to be looking to not issue penalties, encourage overtaking or encourage racing)\n\n[The stated goals of the current guidelines](https://www.fia.com/news/fia-drivers-committee-delivers-driving-standards-guidelines-circuit-racing-championships) is not how they are being applied.""]",0,51,2024-10-29 05:23:37, Discussion,0,0
1geekse,What was happening with Charles on Sunday? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1geekse/what_was_happening_with_charles_on_sunday/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1geekse/what_was_happening_with_charles_on_sunday/,2024-10-28,0 days,"This is a genuine question because I wasn’t able to watch the race and instead caught glimpses in live timings

The main thing i seen about the race was discourse over regulations and then flashes of discourse from the Ferrari  side.

I kind of assumed it was a bit of dramatics from Charles fans (I am also a Charles fan but sometimes things are blown out of proportion), like claiming Ferrari used team orders to stop Charles overtaking in Australia when Charles was never in the position to.

But I finally decided to go back and see what happened and I am so confused about what happened in the first stint.

I don’t think I have enough technical f1 knowledge to know what Ferrari were trying to do. I seen a comment from Fred after seeming to talk about future engine saving?

How urgent was this because continuing to tell Charles to slow his pace and letting him build such a gap is so risky, unless it was needed to finish the race strong.

Especially when they know Lando’s behind and something that’s been true all season but was especially evident with Mclarens updates the previous race, is Mclaren is a different beast on hards.

In COTA, Mclaren went from not even being close to a threat to having more pace than Ferrari on the hards. Ferrari never had to worry about it cause he was stuck behind Max but if he wasn’t then he would’ve been a threat to at least Carlos.

I think COTA made people almost underestimate the pace of the Mclaren because of the dirty air medium stint, but go back and look at Lando on hards, in dirty air. He had very minimal tire age advantage as well.

So going into the second stint, with no Max in between, that is a very dangerous position to be in.

The second stint seems pretty simple. Good pace, get stuck in dirty air behind cars, have Lando catch up and the push very, very hard to try and stay ahead which hurt his tires, especially cause the majority of his pushing was when overtaking lapped cars.

That was the right plan of action for that stint because Mercedes were too far back to be a threat, and so it’s let Lando past and nurse tires or push hard and burn tires but maybe be able to hold Lando back.

But Charles should’ve been able to have a big enough gap from the medium stint to be able to have a solid pace and manage his tires without having to base it on Lando.

You can never bet against Mclaren (specifically Lando) not having the pace advantage on hards on low fuel. Lando has never not been the fastest in those conditions since Imola, unless something he’s stuck behind someone or other extenuating circumstances.

So what i’m wondering is what was the issue? Was it a we need to do this for the sake of the race and the car or we should do this because it’ll help us later and Charles is in a pretty safe position.

Having two drivers running p1 and p2 when they have similar pace and are close together, especially if the one behind has slightly better pace but nothing to switch positions over is a very difficult situation to handle, so was it Ferrari choosing an advantageous time so the drivers wouldn’t fight each other? 

I’m genuinely asking out of confusion because i feel like i’ve missed so many details and i don’t understand what the radio messages were really meaning.","[""It's likely that the brakes were actually heating up too much, given the thin air in Mexico - this was massively exacerbated by running behind Sainz for a short while, especially the 3 or 4 laps where he was within 1.5 seconds.\n\nI will put a little tweak to your points though. Sainz was faster in Mexico, but in Australia the team did radio to Charles to stop him from fighting Sainz. This was because they didn't think they'd be able to challenge for the win again this season - how wrong they were!"", '>You can never bet against Mclaren (specifically Lando) not having the pace advantage on hards on low fuel. Lando has never not been the fastest in those conditions since Imola, unless something he’s stuck behind someone or other extenuating circumstances.\n\nAt the end, it was pretty much this. And then he had the incredible save onto the frontstretch, and that sealed it.', 'There was no issue per se. He had to use LiCo to cool the car and had some holdup from a few backmarkers which closed the gap to Lando.\n\nI’ve seen more than a few fans of a certain fanbase suggest nefarious conspiracies and it really shows how unhinged fans can be.', 'Leclerc was asked to do lico and so was Sainz. However when Leclerc hit the back marker traffic he was told ‘no more lico’ so I assume he was saving his engine for needing to overtake backmarkers. The backmarkers not letting him through quickly enough didn’t help. The McLaren comes alive in the second stint and Norris (who has been saving his tyres for this part of his race) starts eating up the advantage Leclerc built over him throughout the race. Leclerc couldn’t do anything about that as his tyres had gone. Norris was already faster and getting quicker. It was a case of when Norris would pass him not if. He just made it easier by going off the track. \n\nI know that Ferrari radioed Charles to tell him not to fight Sainz, but in their defence it was the right decision. Sainz was faster and they would have lost time fighting knowing that Norris would be coming back at them in the second stint. It worked for Ferrari. I wouldn’t have minded them fighting, it would have been Norris’ win if that happened.', 'I did not compare his onboard with Carlos. But his brake was nearly overheated all the time, which was caused by dirty air probably. And he was seldom great in Mexico, which may also relate to the LiCo issue.', ""I mean even if there was a serious issue with the PU or overheating with the breaks, i doubt they would say it on the radio outright. plus if these were indirect team orders charles' expression after the race would let you know. he is not good at hiding his displeasure lol.\n\nmy conspiracy theory is ollie's crash in fp1 and the rebuild after that did more damage than expected."", 'Backmarkers fucked him.

Also who is more likely to turn things around... is it Lando improving his mentality and his starts or is it Oscar becoming quicker (especially over one lap) ?","['Ask me after the next season, if Piastri is still not matching Norris by the end of that then Norris is better with the higher ceiling.', 'Not in my opinion.

Everyone acknowledges his qualifying pace and how quick he is over one lap but he gets much less recognition for how he’s able to zoom off into the distance as soon as he gets into clean air and gets more out of his tyres than basically anyone else. His race pace and tyre management is some of the best on the grid. Oscar is quite a bit off matching him in those areas too.', 'I find it insane how people often talk about how ""Oscar has improved rapidly"" when he has basically the same average pace gap to Lando now as he did in like the last 1/3rd of 2023', ""I think people should stop asking this question, cut down on the weird Lando hate, and just enjoy watching them both drive.\n\nOscars an excellent driver who's a bit rough around the edges, Lando's a world class driver. It's very easy to start chucking drivers out, until you get the one you want... but why do we all throw every single driver out of the sport when you don't win 7 or 8 world titles.\n\nThat mentality is INSANE and it needs to stop. Be lucky to get one frankly guys."", ""I want people to remember, Norris has never lost a qualifying battle in his career so far as an F1 driver.\n\nOnly other guy on the grid who can say that is Leclerc. \n\nOn top of Lando's excellent qualifying pace (31-11 against Piastri in last 2 seasons in Saturday Qualifying), he's also one of the absolute best at tyre management and banging in consistently excellent laptimes throughout a stint. \n\nLando's weaknesses currently is aggression in wheel to wheel battles and race starts (much improved compared to midseason especially, Baku, Singapore, COTA Sprint, Mexico all were good starts, only bad one was COTA main race, and even that like almost noone in last few years has held the lead into T1, even Verstappen and Leclerc lost the lead in 2021 and 2023 respectively).\n\nAnd as you can see in Mexico, he was much more decisive with Verstappen in the T4 maneuver compared to COTA, which shows his learning process and how he's getting better race by race.\n\nI think Piastri is extremely good, he's still only in his 2nd season and some of these tracks are still new to him. But the talent and potential is undeniable.\n\nI wouldn't say he has a higher ceiling until he starts to show that level consistently. Atleast string together 4-5 races where you constantly outqualify and out race Norris. Even in the races in the middle of the season when he beat Norris like Hungary, Spa, Monza, Etc. he relied on Norris's bad starts to get ahead and then just Norris couldn't get past due to the exact same pace in both cars.""]",0,136,2024-10-29 05:23:38, Discussion,0,3
1gdzn0q,[F1] ‘It’s getting a bit ridiculous’ – Brown gives verdict on Verstappen penalties in Mexico,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/its-getting-a-bit-ridiculous-brown-gives-verdict-on-verstappen-penalties-in.6R6UsyFCceYDPuGC2KfhJO,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gdzn0q/f1_its_getting_a_bit_ridiculous_brown_gives/,2024-10-28,0 days,,"[""I take almost everything team principles, and ceo's say with a grain of salt. The politics that the team principles play is almost to much, but they all do it."", ""Doesn't get a penalty? Not happy. Gets a penalty? Not happy."", ""It's also just exhausting that every battle for position involving Verstappen ends up with some kind of controversy.\n\nI get that some people like drama, but the constant, inevitable negativity whenever anyone dares to try and overtake Verstappen is just taking a lot of the joy out of Formula 1 and what is supposed to be the most thrilling element of the sport - seeing the best in the world going head to head on track for the world championship.\n\nAnd sure, Verstappen will be defended by GP, by Horner, by his legions of fans who will explain that he is, in fact, the victim of a witch hunt against him and that those of us fed up with it are too soft. And whatever, if that's how you feel, fair enough. If that somehow makes you feel like you're better than others, I'm happy for you.\n\nBut with so many great drivers at the front and the competition so enjoyable this season, I'm finding myself wishing Verstappen was just out of the picture as the battles and action between everyone else would probably be amazing. And it's a real shame as a long time fan to reach that point."", 'Verstappen deserved that penalty (though I\'m still a bit confused about the first one, considering previous interpretations of the rules), but calling 20s not enough is ""getting a bit ridiculous"" itself. It cost him a full 2 places in addition to the place against Norris. How is that not enough?\n\nOvertaking off track used to be punished by 5s. Starting this year it\'s 10s. Demanding for even harsher punishments is a bit ridiculous, for how common these kind of incidents are, and how vague the rules often are. Remember, if you demand that Max gets a drive-through yesterday for overtaking off track, then Norris also gets a drive-through last weekend for overtaking off track. I doubt Brown thought that part through with his knee-jerk reflex.\n\nLet\'s leave the harshest penalties for actually dangerous driving and causing collisions that ruin people\'s races.\n\nThat all being said, the big problem with time penalties will always remain that they have wildly different impacts depending how the race unfolds. A 10s penalty can be 0 places, 1 place, or even 10 places if there\'s a late safety car. There have been cases of drivers getting drive-throughs and still winning the race.\n\nMaybe in some cases time penalties should be replaced with direct grid drop penalties. Instead of giving someone a 10s penalty and leaving it up to luck whether that\'s 0 or 10 places, just give them a 2 place penalty directly.', 'He fairly got 20 seconds and 2 penalty points. I love how even when he gets appropriate punishment for breaking rules, there is still someone crying.', 'It doesn’t mean much .. Zac brown complains about everything. His verdict carries little weight. Broken clock is right ..', ""It's embarrassing to watch a driver with the ability Max has resort to the tactics that we saw yesterday. (And other occasions)"", 'McKaren. 20 seconds was more than enough for that.', 'I liked the race a lot, action, drama, emotion. keep it up….\n\nI leave the drama after the race for you']",0,134,2024-10-29 05:23:39, News,0,0
