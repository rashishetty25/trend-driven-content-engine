Why was Piastri given a 5 second penalty for forcing another driver off, but the way that Sainz passed Leclerc, and then they BOTH passed Russell wasn't forcing ?

What's the difference in the passes each driver made ?","[""The sport decided that ahead at the apex = entitled to space, Piastri was probably fractionally behind amd had to yield.

In Piastri’s case, Gasly was ahead, so he was entitled to racing room on the outside.

Don't know what race they were watching."", 'Gasly had track position going into the corner and was on the racing line. Piastri had his car angled in a way where he was not going to be able to make the corner while still being able to allow Gasly sufficient racing room. He continued his line, meaning Gasly had to change his line and go off track to avoid a collision.\n\nLeclerc was in front vs Sainz. Leclerc ran wide. Sainz stayed on track and passed him. Sainz did not force Leclerc to go off.\n\nThe Russell ones are more borderline IMO, but I suspect since the Ferraris were choosing legitimate lines that’s the difference. Piastri knew he wouldn’t make the corner.', 'Here\'s the theory.....  it\'s up to you to decide whether the facts of any situation fit or not...\n\nThe driver in the lead is free to choose his own line... (there are rules to follow about not changing line after braking, how many times you can change line on a straight, etc.)\n\nThe car following has to not hit the car ahead.\n\nIf an overtaking attempt ""up the inside"" is made, then either....\n\n1) The overtaking attempt is successfully completed before the apex of the corner, so the over-taker is free to choose their line out of the corner....  they will likely go quite wide....   and the car that is now following is free to choose running even wider and leaving the track, or slowing down and tucking in behind.  This is a free choice and they were not forced to do anything...\n\n2) The attempted overtake has not been completed by the apex, the outside driver is supposed to be free to choose whatever line they want...   but they can\'t turn in as much as they want because there\'s a car there... forcing them to not turn in on thier intended path... if the inside car has actually slowed enough that it can leave a car-width at the exit then they will (or at least, should)... and the outside car will likely retain the lead... but a failed dive-bomb attempt usually results in a car that\'s heading to the outside of the track (or even off it)... and so the car that is supposed to have free choice of line is forced to run off the track to avoid a collision...\n\nAnd so while the outside car has run out of room on the track in either situation... only one of them is considered to be ""forced off the track"".\n\nAnd then in either of those cases... both cars also need to avoid gaining an advantage while off the track...  even if you\'re forced to run wide by a dive-bomb that didn\'t get past before the apex, that doesn\'t give you an excuse to keep your foot on the accelerator and sweep around the outside (assuming sufficient runoff exists to allow that).', 'They were marginal.\n\nWith Piastri, he came from behind and forced the Alpine off he was basically just alongside.\n\nWith the Ferrari they were almost fully past the other car and then ran them wide to optimise their corner.', 'FIA have basically decided if you are ahead at the apex you have ownership of the corner and can basically just run other cars off track without consequence.\n\nOscar was not ahead at the apex.

*But* that penalty was inconsistent to what we’ve seen recently - most notably t1 with Norris and Verstappen. So, for the purpose of this post let’s ignore Russel’s penalty as that’s another whole discussion.  

If the rules for the most part are that you can get away with that then why is that the case?
You can just go into a corner and escort your opponent wide? What’s with that? - we will never see any interesting racing.

Especially when the driver that’s been pushed off can’t even fight back because they’ll get a penalty for “keeping the position by going off track” when they had nowhere else to go. 

If it were up to me you’d have to leave a cars width to the car on the outside, when overtaking and defending, as is the rules in most other respects of motorsport afaik. 

Am I alone in thinking this? 


Edit: lmao looks like they’ve decided mid race that actually they agree with everything mentioned above and now they are handing the penalties out like sweets - how they mess this up so often I don’t even know ","[""I don't think we have any rules any longer. It's such a clusterfuck"", 'No rules, just vibes', ""It's a never ending back and forth when it comes to these rules.

The rules are okay, for the most part, but their implementation isn't. It's why I don't think that any change will be good. The problem lies elsewhere."", 'The rule is you have to be ahead at the apex. It’s stupid though because a late dive bomb would technically be legal yet a more controlled overtake like Russell’s isn’t', 'T1 incident deserved a penalty regardless of stewarding being more lenient on lap 1. Stewarding is overly subjective in general', 'You will go insane before you manage to find any kind of consistency from the stewards', ""i fully believe forcing another driver off the track should be a penalty 100% of the time - the problem is it's only a penalty like 30% of the time, so it's just random who gets punished and who doesn't\n\nreally hope this comes up in the driver meeting next week because this is just getting silly"", 'Start and lap 1 are relegated more lenient, so you can\'t compare it with Verstappen/Norris really. \n\nIt was quite similar to Sainz in the sprint, but a bit less extreme I would say. I think because the ""newish"" overtaking rules where you can claim the inside line if you\'re ahead, we\'ve seen this happening more.
