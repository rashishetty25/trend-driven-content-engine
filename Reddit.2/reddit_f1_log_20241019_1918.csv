Great first day at COTA!  We had a blast.   My only complaint was I had no idea who got bounced during each round of quali.  It’s hard to hear the announcers and my old lady eyes can’t see the screens.  😂

Enjoy! ","['Does he spin more if you call him sir?', 'Great video! If you have an Amex credit card, find one of their radio kiosks. You can just scan your card and get a radio for free that plays the TV broadcast sound.\n\nBarring that, I believe you can buy a radio yourself in town and tune to the broadcast when you’re at the track, but do some research on that so I don’t lead ya astray.', 'It’s so, so much worse now that’s he’s a sir.', 'hurricanemilton back at it again', ""Just practicing going 'round the table."", ""He's no Jenny from the block.
