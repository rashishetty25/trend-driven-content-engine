*But* that penalty was inconsistent to what we’ve seen recently - most notably t1 with Norris and Verstappen. So, for the purpose of this post let’s ignore Russel’s penalty as that’s another whole discussion.  

If the rules for the most part are that you can get away with that then why is that the case?
You can just go into a corner and escort your opponent wide? What’s with that? - we will never see any interesting racing.

Especially when the driver that’s been pushed off can’t even fight back because they’ll get a penalty for “keeping the position by going off track” when they had nowhere else to go. 

If it were up to me you’d have to leave a cars width to the car on the outside, when overtaking and defending, as is the rules in most other respects of motorsport afaik. 

Am I alone in thinking this?

Apparently there is a more recent version but not publicly available. Key point is 


Guidelines for overtaking on the outside of a corner:


- In order for a car being overtaken to be required to give sufficient room to an overtaking car, the
overtaking car needs to have a significant portion of the car alongside the car being overtaken and
the overtaking manoeuvre must be done in a safe and controlled manner, while enabling the car to
clearly remain within the limits of the track.

- When considering what is a ‘significant portion’, for an overtaking on the outside of a corner, among
the various factors that will be looked at by the stewards when exercising their discretion, the
stewards will consider if the overtaking car is ahead of the other car from the apex of the corner.

- The car being overtaken must be capable of making the corner while remaining within the limits of
the track.

As for overtaking on the outside of a corner, the guidelines acknowledge that it is a more difficult move to pull off.

For a long time drivers have been taught from karting all the way through the racing pyramid that if you try to hang it round the outside, you are at risk of running out of road.

It’s often been left up to how hard certain drivers race. ‘Fairer’ drivers will leave a bit of room for their rivals, more ruthless drivers will edge them out.

But in recent years there has been a clear effort to define when it’s essential for a driver to leave space, and that’s the case in the new guidelines as well.

So, for a driver to be given room when overtaking on the outside, including at the exit of the corner, the overtaking car must:

-Have the front axle AT LEAST ALONGSIDE the front axle of the other car at the apex of the corner AND to the exit
-Be driven in a safe and controlled manner throughout the manoeuvre (entry, apex and exit)
-Be able to make the corner within the track limits

In a lot of cases this is going to leave a driver at the mercy of their rival or the laws of physics as cars on the inside wash out.

This isn’t intended to stop an optimistic pass, it just means drivers have to accept the risks involved. It is quite close to being a codified ‘live by the sword, die by the sword’ rule.

1g89hcn,Why does forcing another driver off the track makes a difference if you are attacker or defender?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g89hcn/why_does_forcing_another_driver_off_the_track/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g89hcn/why_does_forcing_another_driver_off_the_track/,2024-10-20,0 days,"How does this makes any sense in the context of Yuki, George and I think it was Piere getting all a 5 second penalty for forcing a driver off the track and Max not getting a penalty even though he did the exact same but was a defender instead of attacker?

All the talk about stewarding decisions taking the action and not the consequences into consideration is again bullshit as its not happening.

Why do not give Max a 5 sec penalty?. Would be just fair and consistend as Max was definitely in the wrong doing the same stuff as 3 other drivers that got a penalty.

/Edit: And also to make it clear i do not argue gor Lando not getting a Penalty that was correct also as he still gained an advantage bei going this far off. But the same time Verstappen got an advantage by forcing another driver off.","[""The rules essentially say that you can't force a driver off the track to overtake, and you can't go off the track to overtake.\n\nThe majority of the responsibility is on the attacking driver."", 'It doesn’t. The rule is you need to overtake cleanly or give the position back.', 'Attacking party has to get by cleanly. If he forced the defending party off the track, it wasnt clean.   \nDefending party has the right of line if equal at the apex line. So they can run the car wide and take the line and attacking party has to back off. \n\nIt all comes down to when they enter the corner and who is ahead. Because if attacker is far enough ahead on the outside, they have the right of line and defending has to leave a car wide space on exit.', 'So I think the rule is, don’t brake, overshoot corner, force the other driver off, profit? I think.', ""If you're not ahead at the apex, you are not entitled to space, and the inside car can push you off the track legally."", 'Difference is Russel finished the overtake before the corner. Norris did the overtake already outside the track.', ""I think if Lando hadn't overtaken him off the track, maybe Max would've gotten the penalty. The apex rule is ambiguous and easily exploited, but overtaking off the track is pretty clearcut. Had he let Max go there, he could've argued that he couldn't overtake because he was pushed off. Besides that, he would've had the pace to get him after that, so maybe that was the smarter move anyway. Lando and Mclaren need to be smarter in my opinion. Austria was another example where Lando should've been more patient, because he had the pace to get him eventually."", 'Because the rule is stupid and they should have changed it years ago', ""I think it is ridiculous that Max didn't get at least a warning, considering he was ran off-track, as well.""]",0,193,2024-10-20 23:24:10, Discussion,0,12
