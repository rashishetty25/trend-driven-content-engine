Even before this weekend's US Grand Prix in Austin (Texas), the driver question for next year is still unresolved. Even Valtteri Bottas, who is actually considered a hot candidate, seems to be increasingly preoccupied with this - and above all unsettled!\n\nValtteri Bottas is waiting for the decision from Sauber/Audi\n\n‚ÄòI had said that I hoped everything would be sorted out by Austin, but I'm still waiting for the final decisions,‚Äô said Bottas, who apparently can't explain why he doesn't yet have a contract for next year in his pocket. ‚ÄòI think Mattia \\[Binotto, team principal\\] should answer that question rather than me.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòIt's out of my hands,‚Äô says the Finn, who ‚Äúcan't do anything at the moment‚Äù except wait and see. ‚ÄòOf course, I'm trying to do my best this week and hope that lifts the mood.

I know the conditions I'm getting into and I'm just waiting for the green light.‚Äô\n\nBottas: ‚ÄòThere is a risk of not having a cockpit‚Äô\n\nThe Sauber driver was unable to say how long the decision would take on Thursday ahead of the US GP. ‚ÄòA month ago, we were told as soon as possible,‚Äô recalls Bottas, who will ‚Äúhopefully soon‚Äù receive an answer regarding his future in Formula 1. ‚ÄòOf course, there will also be a deadline from my side at some point.‚Äô\n\nThe big question: Who will be in the Sauber cockpit in 2025?\n\nIf the 240-time GP starter wants to look outside Formula 1 or take on another role in the premier class, he should make a decision in the coming weeks. ‚ÄòChristmas is coming soon, and there will be no vacancies anywhere,‚Äô warns the otherwise relaxed Finn.\n\nBottas, who has been driving in Formula 1 since 2013 and has celebrated ten Grand Prix victories to date, is therefore also worried that he will no longer have a cockpit next year. ‚ÄòIn the situation I'm in now, with only one free seat, there is of course a risk,‚Äô admits the 35-year-old honestly.\n\nMoney ‚Äòshouldn't be the problem‚Äô\n\nHowever, Bottas rules out the possibility that it could be down to him asking for too much money, for example, because ‚Äòthat shouldn't be an issue. I think the conditions we are talking about are as they should be and I think Audi should have the budget, at least that's what they say. So I don't think that should be a problem.‚Äô\n\nAfter all, he has ‚Äòalready built up a good relationship with Mattia‚Äô and talked about both his future and the plans for 2025. ‚ÄòI've been told everything so far,‚Äô reveals the current Sauber driver, who also knows that Sauber/Audi has other options for 2025.\n\n‚ÄòI love Formula 1 and I want to drive in Formula 1.

However, this is not easy, because ‚Äòif you don't have the car, it's really difficult to show what you can do‚Äô.\n\n‚ÄòAnd the people who make decisions also tend to look at the results,‚Äô fears the 35-year-old. ‚ÄòIt's not easy to shine at the moment, but I just have to trust Mattia. I just have to trust that he knows what he's getting from me.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòI feel and believe that I should have this cockpit and that it's the best thing for the team,‚Äô says Bottas optimistically ahead of the Grand Prix in Austin.

This includes a reorganisation of the way the regulations are laid out, which will be divided into thematic sections for clarity and consistency. The transition to the new structure will be concluded in the next few months.\n \n>The 2026 Technical Regulations (Section C), originally approved in June 2024, were subject to extensive enhancements to the aerodynamic regulations, which have been the subject of a strong collaboration between the FIA, FOM and the Formula 1 teams.

They have introduced measures to regulate the energy management of the Power Units as well as the management of the adjustable aerodynamics, which will involve the deployment of the ‚Äústraight-line mode‚Äù (low drag) and the ‚Äúcornering mode‚Äù (high downforce). In addition, there will be three pre-season tests of three days each for the 2026 season to account for the new power units that will be adopted.\n \n>The 2026 Financial Regulations (Section D) have built on the experience gained by the FIA, Formula 1 and the teams since the first introduction of Financial Regulations in 2021. Significant effort has been made to simplify the regulations by changes in the perimeter of exclusions and adjustment methodologies and to strengthen measures available to FIA to monitor compliance to the Financial Regulations. The overall level of the cost cap has remained ‚Äì in effect ‚Äì equivalent to the current levels, while the changes to the actual number reflect the changes to exclusion and adjustment perimeter and the effect of cumulative inflation.\n \n> Further elements will be submitted to the World Council for approval in the coming months to complete the regulation package for 2026, while refinements to the already approved sections will continue with the collaboration between the FIA, FOM and the Formula 1 teams.\n\n>**Regulatory updates**          \n>**FIA Formula One World Championship**\n \n>Minor changes for 2024 and 2025 Sporting and Technical regulations were approved by the World Council, including the removal of the point awarded for setting the fastest lap and the increase in requirement for fielding a young driver during free practice from once per season to two times per season.', 'Doesn‚Äôt this say that teams will have to do four rookie practice sessions next year, not remove the requirement completely like people were reporting earlier?', ""It looks like somebody messed up when they tweeted about the rookie sessions.
