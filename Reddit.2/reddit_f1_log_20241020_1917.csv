Why was Piastri given a 5 second penalty for forcing another driver off, but the way that Sainz passed Leclerc, and then they BOTH passed Russell wasn't forcing ?

What's the difference in the passes each driver made ?","[""The sport decided that ahead at the apex = entitled to space, Piastri was probably fractionally behind amd had to yield.

Piastri had his car angled in a way where he was not going to be able to make the corner while still being able to allow Gasly sufficient racing room. He continued his line, meaning Gasly had to change his line and go off track to avoid a collision.\n\nLeclerc was in front vs Sainz. Leclerc ran wide. Sainz stayed on track and passed him.

Piastri knew he wouldn’t make the corner.', 'Here\'s the theory.....  it\'s up to you to decide whether the facts of any situation fit or not...\n\nThe driver in the lead is free to choose his own line...

This is a free choice and they were not forced to do anything...\n\n2) The attempted overtake has not been completed by the apex, the outside driver is supposed to be free to choose whatever line they want...   but they can\'t turn in as much as they want because there\'s a car there... forcing them to not turn in on thier intended path... if the inside car has actually slowed enough that it can leave a car-width at the exit then they will (or at least, should)... and the outside car will likely retain the lead... but a failed dive-bomb attempt usually results in a car that\'s heading to the outside of the track (or even off it)... and so the car that is supposed to have free choice of line is forced to run off the track to avoid a collision...\n\nAnd so while the outside car has run out of room on the track in either situation... only one of them is considered to be ""forced off the track"".\n\nAnd then in either of those cases... both cars also need to avoid gaining an advantage while off the track...  even if you\'re forced to run wide by a dive-bomb that didn\'t get past before the apex, that doesn\'t give you an excuse to keep your foot on the accelerator and sweep around the outside (assuming sufficient runoff exists to allow that).', 'They were marginal.\n\nWith Piastri, he came from behind and forced the Alpine off he was basically just alongside.\n\nWith the Ferrari they were almost fully past the other car and then ran them wide to optimise their corner.', 'FIA have basically decided if you are ahead at the apex you have ownership of the corner and can basically just run other cars off track without consequence.\n\nOscar was not ahead at the apex.

McLaren told Lando as early as lap 5, basically 25% into the sprint that Max's tyres were degrading too fast and also on lap 6.

This was obviously wrong information which may have inspired Lando to push more than he should to try and chase Max instead of focussing on keeping the fast Ferraris behind.

McLaren seem to lack the pace this weekend. They should have done what Max did in Singapore. Recognise early that their rival has superior pace and focus on consolidating P2.
