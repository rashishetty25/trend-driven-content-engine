Another proposal is to implement stricter licensing requirements, establishing higher standards that drivers must meet to continue racing in F1. Yet, this could be counterproductive, as a driver's performance often hinges on the quality of the car.

https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9dt5h/with_calls_for_new_rule_changes_after_verstappens/
https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga7lqk/by_request_i_also_compiled_all_the_f1_rules/

After compiling lists of rule changes and clarifications prompted by Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton, several users suggested I create a similar breakdown for Sebastian Vettel. However, in researching Vettel‚Äôs career, I discovered that while he was certainly involved in high-profile incidents, relatively few resulted in formal rule changes or FIA clarifications directly because of his actions.

In fact, only two racing incidents directly led to regulatory changes or clarifications. 

- - - 

**1. Team Orders and the ‚ÄúMulti-21‚Äù Incident**

Race: 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix

Incident: During the final stages of the race, Red Bull instructed Vettel to hold his position behind teammate Mark Webber using the ""Multi-21"" code. Ignoring the directive, Vettel overtook Webber, leading to significant tension within the team and sparking wider debates on team orders in F1.

Rule Discussion: Although the incident did not result in a formal rule change, it led the FIA to reinforce its stance that team orders were permissible within teams but that the enforcement was up to the teams themselves. This set a precedent for how team orders would be handled going forward, emphasizing FIA neutrality in intra-team directives‚Äã.


**2. Helmet Design Restrictions**

Year Introduced: 2015

Incident: Known for debuting new helmet designs almost every race during his time with Red Bull, Vettel‚Äôs constant changes created issues with driver recognition, particularly for fans and officials who sometimes found it difficult to identify him on track.

Rule Change: To enhance driver visibility and consistency, the FIA implemented a rule limiting drivers to a single primary helmet design per season, with allowances for one special event helmet. This rule was a direct response to (mostly) Vettel‚Äôs frequent design changes and aimed to maintain a consistent look for each driver throughout the season.‚Äã
‚Äã

**3. Track Re-Entry Safety**

Race: 2019 Canadian Grand Prix

Incident: Leading the race, Vettel ran off-track under pressure from Hamilton. When he rejoined, his manoeuvre forced Hamilton to slow to avoid a collision, leading to a five-second penalty that cost Vettel the race win and sparked intense debate about fair re-entry practices.

Rule Clarification: The FIA responded by clarifying its rules around track re-entry, specifying that drivers must rejoin the track safely without impeding others or forcing them to change their racing line. This clarification helped to set clearer expectations for safe re-entry in similar scenarios going forward‚Äã.
‚Äã

**4. Advocacy for Consistency in Stewarding**

Years: 2020-2021 (Various races)

Incident: Over multiple races, Vettel vocally criticized inconsistencies in stewarding, especially concerning track limits, penalty decisions, and race director judgments. His frustration highlighted the need for uniform rule enforcement and drew attention to the impact of inconsistent decision-making on race outcomes.

Rule Discussion: Although this advocacy didn‚Äôt lead to any specific rule change, it fueled discussions around fairness in penalty application and contributed to a broader movement for consistent rule enforcement. The FIA ultimately restructured its approach to race direction following the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, suggesting that Vettel‚Äôs efforts may have nudged F1 in a more consistent direction‚Äã.


**5. Concerns About the Virtual Safety Car Loophole**

(*edit: added after suggestion by /u/cafk)*

Year: 2021

Incident: Vettel voiced concerns about drivers exploiting loopholes in the VSC system, specifically how some were gaining an unfair advantage during race situations. He emphasized the need for clearer rules to maintain fair competition.

Rule clarification: Following his remarks, the FIA acknowledged these concerns and committed to reviewing and addressing the VSC system to close any loopholes, showcasing how Vettel's advocacy influenced ongoing discussions about rule enforcement in F1.

- - - 


To give a fuller picture, I‚Äôve also included some debatable cases where Vettel‚Äôs actions sparked discussions or reinforced existing rules but I believe did not prompt specific rule changes or clarifications.

**Debatable Incidents Not Included:**

**1. Multi-Weaving in Defensive Moves**

Race: 2012 Italian Grand Prix

Incident: Vettel‚Äôs defensive move at Curva Grande pushed Fernando Alonso off-track, leading to a drive-through penalty.

Reason Not Included: The penalty reinforced the ‚Äúone-move‚Äù rule in defensive driving but did not prompt a new rule or a further clarification on defensive tactics.

**2. Collision with Hamilton Behind Safety Car**

Race: 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Incident: Believing Hamilton had brake-checked him, Vettel collided with Hamilton under the safety car and pulled alongside to express his frustration, which led to a time penalty.

Reason Not Included: Although it reinforced standards of sportsmanship under caution, it did not lead to a formal rule change or clarification. The FIA upheld existing standards on conduct during the safety car without redefining them.

**3. Overtaking on Pit Lane Entry**

(*edit: added after suggestion by /u/cafk)*

Race: 2016 Chinese Grand Prix

Incident: While entering the pits, Vettel overtook ~~Daniil Kyvat~~ Jenson Button and Carlos Sainz on the pit lane entry, highlighting an ambiguous area in the rules regarding overtaking in non-race conditions like pit lane entry.
Outcome: Although Vettel‚Äôs maneuver raised questions and sparked discussion about whether overtaking should be restricted in the pit entry area, the FIA chose not to issue a clarification or rule change at the time.

The year started out with Villeneuve outqualifying the entire field by 2 seconds in Australia, but Ferrari closed that gap down at a rate of knots. Certainly by the second half of the year the difference in performance between Williams and Ferrari was small enough that Schumacher's talent advantage could make up the difference.\n\nWilliams actually had to pause development on their 1998 car to bring upgrades to the FW19 to prevent the title slipping away, which also explains why the 1998 car ended up so undercooked."", ""Yes, he made a few mistakes, but still smashed his team mate.

The line oft repeated is that each position in the championship is worth millions to the teams, however, with the 2026 regulation change looming, and the fact that teams are unable to work on the 2026 cars until the 1st of January 2025, it's made me begin to wonder if finishing 3rd in the WCC might benefit Red Bull in their preparations for the regulation changes.

Each position lost gains a significant extra chunk of wind tunnel runs and CFD time. Is this enough of a benefit for 2026 that it outweighs the financial penalty of finishing further down the table and thus means Sergio's lack of performance is being left unaddressed?

The team that won the WCC got numbers 1 and 2, the WCC runners-up got 3 and 4, so on and so forth.\n\nIn 2014, the rules changed so that drivers pick their own numbers and stick with it until they retire (or spend more than 2 years out of the sport). However, they are forbidden from using the number 1 unless they win the driver's championship, as is the case with Verstappen from 2022 to now. Running the number 1 as a reigning champion though is completely optional, and Hamilton opted to keep his 44 every year that he won the WDC.""]",0,62,2024-10-26 04:27:49, Discussion,0,2
