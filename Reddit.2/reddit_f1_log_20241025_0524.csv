1gb8cq6,About Alonso's supposed 400th Grand Prix start this weekend,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb8cq6/about_alonsos_supposed_400th_grand_prix_start/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb8cq6/about_alonsos_supposed_400th_grand_prix_start/,2024-10-24,0 days,"This weekend is marked by the celebration of Alonso's 400th GP, which is an impressive number never achieved before. But after checking in the [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/en/drivers/fernando-alonso) and [Stats F1](https://www.statsf1.com/en/fernando-alonso.aspx) websites, I've realized that this weekend is NOT his 400th GP start, but rather his 400th GP entered.

  
In reality, Alonso is currently at 396 races started. It's important to clarify that the differences in races entered and races started is marked by the DNS (Did not start), which by its own definition doesn't count as a started race. During Alonso's career there have been 3 DNS.

  
1. Belgium 2001: This one is pretty interesting, since Fernando actually started and did 3 laps before retiring due to a broken gearshaft. In lap 4 there was a massive crash between the Prost of Burti and the Jaguar of Irvine which triggered a red flag. Following the regulations of the time, the first 4 laps were voided, meaning that officialy, Alonso never started the race.

2. USA 2005: Well, this one is mostly known, but after issues with the Michelin tyres during practice, all teams using them pulled in at the end of the formation lap and did not start the race, including Alonso.

3. Russia 2017: Engine issue during the formation lap which forced Alonso to fail to start the race.

  
All of this means that Alonso is currently sitting at 399 entered GPs and 396 started GPs. This weekend will be his 400th **entered race**, and if he manages to start all the following races, **he will start his 400th race in Qatar**.","[""Y'all ruin everything. You were supposed to wait until he retires with 500 GP starts THEN bring this up, so he has to come back and complete his last 3 races to earn the title, Mr. 500."", "">he will start his 400th race in Qatar.\n\nWe'll see about that, hope he feels better for FP2."", 'I am impressed he didn‚Äôt suffer from any engine DNS with the amount of time he raced for Renault/Alpine.', 'LOL F1 Instagram [stories](https://imgur.com/a/DUD6voG) setting the record straight', 'This is silly, it\'s his 400th GP, which is a full weekend, made up of multiple stages\n\n400 ""Starts"" is being taken too literally as in just the Race part of the weekend, other sites have it listed as his ""400th GP Weekend"". \n\nI\'d argue though, once you are entered and the weekend has started, that counts as a GP start, regardless if you DNS the actual race, but idk how the stats are looked at', 'These milestones are always marked by number of races entered rather than number of races started. And I‚Äôd argue in Alonso‚Äôs case since he at least started the formation lap of all three races he‚Äôs had recorded as a DNS, it‚Äôs pretty disingenuous to argue that this weekend isn‚Äôt his 400th race.', 'Hmm. \n\nSainz recently had his 200th (200rd? üòÑ) race and I remember they must have taken his DNS stats into consideration because he started on the exact same race as Max but their 200th races were a few races apart.', ""If you count Sprints (which I know we don't, don't throw hands at me) then he's surpassed 400 even without the DNSs"", ""Technically, and specifically, correct. However...\n\nYou don't just rock up on a Sunday. There's a week's worth of work ahead of that.
