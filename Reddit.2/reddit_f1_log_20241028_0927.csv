Given Lando's pace at the end, the time loss against Verstappen, and any potential damage, it's not unreasonable to think Norris could have won this race with Verstappen 4th, behind the two Ferraris and Lando. If this happened, Verstappen would have dropped 13 points. Instead, he loses just 10 points to Lando. I appreciate it's not a huge difference, but it makes me wonder if it was part of his mindset going into this race.

Edit: I know we saw similar with Hamilton in 2021 as well. Should this lead to discussions about the time of penalties awarded? Should time penalties be served sooner (like the old 3 laps to serve a stop/go), should you be allowed to change tires at the same time?

By now, there shouldn't be any smidgen of doubt that RB needs to part with Checo Perez.
He is not able to extract any sort of performance from the RB20.
It's getting ridiculous how big the gap has become with Max... and the rest of the field.

Realistically, I think there's only two options: either promote Lawson or Tsunoda to RB.
Tsunoda in that respect is, although talented,  bit erratic in his driving as of late.
Lawson on the other might be the best choice IMO. Of course he's not that experienced yet (so there's always the danger of a Gasly, Kvyat or Albon scenario at RB), but he drives calmly and smart.

A swap with one of them is not an option I think for Perez. That would be an embarrassment, frankly.

What do you think?","[""They can't.\nIf they keep him, Max is 100% not winning the championship.\nThey can't handle 2 competing McLarens and Ferraris with no backup driver support."", 'They absolutely can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs costing the teams millions, literally‚Ä¶ third in a drivers championship they could‚Äôve won is losing them a fortune\n\nAnd redbull needs to look at the future‚Ä¶ Max is very clear that he won‚Äôt stick around when he would be considered old, he‚Äôs not a fernando or a lewis‚Ä¶ Redbull needs someone to take over the team when Max leaves‚Ä¶ they can‚Äôt afford to wait till Max is gone to start looking for a new potential world champion', 'Such a performance on a home race must be absolutely ridiculed.

They could have had literally else in that car by now but I guess they think the money must be worth having a bottleneck. Like, how badly managed do you have to be to have two teams and somehow still not enough seats because one of the big ones has to go to a pay driver. Fuck that felt good, this forza ferrari thing feels great lol', 'My guess is that Perez is still there because there might be a slight possibility that Max might leave if they loose both titles. On the surface everything looks fine at Redbull but below that is probably lots of discontent with how things are going and the drama from the start of the year is also still lingering.\n\nI still see Max out if he looses the WDC either still to another team which boots one of their current drivers or taking a sabbatical or even retire with all the bullshit going on recently with the FIA etc.\n\nSo Redbull hang on to Perez as they can use the cash and they do want atleast one driver in 2025 who knows the team and the car so they can better prepare for 2026.\n\nBut lets see maybe im wrong but I still have the feeling we have not seen all from what still is awaiting Redbull ones the titles are both lost and the infighting really starts.']",264,175,2024-10-28 09:26:42, Discussion,5,7
