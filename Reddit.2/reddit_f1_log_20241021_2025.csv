I know the year Keke Rosberg won was similar, but that was an anomaly, and there were A LOT less races back then. 

Max looks likely to retain his title through consistent 2nd-5th place finishes. If he doesn’t win another race this year, that means he ends the season as champions despite not winning for 14 races in a row. That’s longer than most seasons prior to this century!

](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/doc_2_-_2022_imola_event_-_fia_f1_driving_standard_guidelines.pdf)

Apparently there is a more recent version but not publicly available. Key point is 


Guidelines for overtaking on the outside of a corner:


- In order for a car being overtaken to be required to give sufficient room to an overtaking car, the
overtaking car needs to have a significant portion of the car alongside the car being overtaken and
the overtaking manoeuvre must be done in a safe and controlled manner, while enabling the car to
clearly remain within the limits of the track.

- When considering what is a ‘significant portion’, for an overtaking on the outside of a corner, among
the various factors that will be looked at by the stewards when exercising their discretion, the
stewards will consider if the overtaking car is ahead of the other car from the apex of the corner.

- The car being overtaken must be capable of making the corner while remaining within the limits of

So Lando wasn't ahead at the apex hence wasn't entitled to room. However, the last point says that Max must be capable of making the corner as well. So IMO they are both in the wrong (or call it a racing incident). Thoughts?

1g8pn74,What do you think is realistically Franco’s future in 2025?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8pn74/what_do_you_think_is_realistically_francos_future/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8pn74/what_do_you_think_is_realistically_francos_future/,2024-10-21,0 days,"I started following F1 just this year and I see the changes and dropping of drivers who “had a contract” and I see everything as a possibility now (Franco replacing Verstappen? lol)


As a Latin American I want all drivers from here to do great and have a chance. Also meaning those who had a chance and can not make it in a top team should be dropped and make space for the ones who want a chance.

So I wonder how does contracts work? Because for example I know Oscar was driving for other team Jr program and then got into McLaren.

So we have teams with drivers who are obviously underperforming (given their pairs performance) and many young drivers (the ones who have won F2 championships on the past, for example, or Franco who looks obviously capable of running F1 and brings Williams HUGE marketing strategy that runs on its own with the crazy fan base that guy has. If he makes it to another season it will become a cult lol

So not me being an expert but basically Stroll and Checo if you ask me (I’m no expert so please correct me if I am wrong). The RB car might be shit this season in comparison to what they had before but it is still waaaaay better than the Williams who don’t even think of them as their competitors because they are supposed to be between the top three. How is Checo not making a podium or being more relevant? 

So I guess my question is, what would need to happen for him to get a 2025 contract? Could another team besides Williams just offer more and get him? Or would he be supposed to stay as Williams reserve?

I don’t know and I need someone with more knowledge to tell me what your idea is and in which cases we would get more of his post-race interviews next year. He looks so genuine and like he actually drives for fun even though is a so serious job.

Let’s please keep Franco 🥲","[""I think the most realistic thing is to take the route Lawson took. He is showing what he is capable of and should keep a close relation to Williams, maybe Albon or Sainz will get an offer for a promising 2026 team and then he'll get the spot."", ""F1 teams are a business. Winning is the biggest element but do not underestimate the money making part. RB are happy with Checo since his contract brings a lot of Mexican sponsorship money. Danny Ric sadly was way past his prime but he's a huge name and a fan favorite and it was his management team that got the Visa sponsorship (probably a reason why he was kicked out in the most shitty way VCARB probably wanted to get rid of him without the sponsors pulling out. Stroll... well his dad owns the team so while Stroll in my opinion is not the worst but his long tenure is probably a vanity project at this point.\n\nSo really for Colapinto to secure a seat he needs to prove his skill and also have a management team that secures good sponsorship for the team signing him. They would likely need to sell that Argentina has a good following for F1 and/or could bring valuable sponsorship money."", ""Franco is very unlucky because most of the obvious drivers that could lose a seat have probably done so for 2025:\n\nMagnussen, Zhou, Sargeant, Bottas (?), Ricciardo.\n\nOf the ones left, there is no one who's really on the hot seat (maybe Bottas if he keeps the Sauber seat), I can only see an opening if one of the rookies performs really poorly, or maybe Tsunoda now that Honda is leaving the RB/RBR family."", ""I think reserve driver is the most likely outcome.

Not so that he could go to AM or Ferrari but because that would get the market moving. But maybe Hulk and Yuki leaving is gonna happen sooner than those two leaving the sport lol."", 'Promote a RB driver to RBR and hire Colapinto for RB (I hope)', 'Grazing out in a field somewhere', 'He’ll probably ride out ‘25 as a Williams reserve and get a seat for ‘26.\xa0There’s only one slot on the grid left to fill for next season and it’s at Sauber. They seem to be leaning towards either re-signing Bottas or giving Gabriel Bortoleto a shot.\n\nStroll and Checo are both safe because they’re pay drivers. Perez has massive financial backing from a very rich Mexican in Carlos Slim, which supposedly pays Red Bull enough to compensate for any drops in the WCC due to his poor performance. Lance’s dad literally owns the Aston Martin F1 team so that seat is his until he decides to retire, basically. Sucks, but business is business unfortunately. Nothing us commoners can do about it.\n\nAll of that out of the way, Colapinto will be at the top of any team’s shortlist for a ‘26 seat with the way he’s been driving. He’s shown strong pace immediately and seems to be very level-headed for somebody so young. I wouldn’t be surprised to see him substituting for drivers at other teams throughout ‘25 if somebody happens to get injured or simply underperforms.']",37,102,2024-10-21 20:25:40, Discussion,6,9

As for overtaking on the outside of a corner, the guidelines acknowledge that it is a more difficult move to pull off.

For a long time drivers have been taught from karting all the way through the racing pyramid that if you try to hang it round the outside, you are at risk of running out of road.

It’s often been left up to how hard certain drivers race. ‘Fairer’ drivers will leave a bit of room for their rivals, more ruthless drivers will edge them out.

But in recent years there has been a clear effort to define when it’s essential for a driver to leave space, and that’s the case in the new guidelines as well.

So, for a driver to be given room when overtaking on the outside, including at the exit of the corner, the overtaking car must:

-Have the front axle AT LEAST ALONGSIDE the front axle of the other car at the apex of the corner AND to the exit
-Be driven in a safe and controlled manner throughout the manoeuvre (entry, apex and exit)
-Be able to make the corner within the track limits

In a lot of cases this is going to leave a driver at the mercy of their rival or the laws of physics as cars on the inside wash out.

This isn’t intended to stop an optimistic pass, it just means drivers have to accept the risks involved. It is quite close to being a codified ‘live by the sword, die by the sword’ rule. ","['>\t— Be driven in a safe and controlled manner throughout the manoeuvre (entry, apex and exit)\n\n>\t— Be able to make the corner within the track limits\n\nabout that….', 'I feel like ahead at the apex loses all meaning when Max is only ahead at the apex because he has no intention of keeping the car on track.', 'Sorry for the odd formatting… doing from my phone!', 'Is Lando even considered the overtaker, if he is ahead prior to the braking zones?', ""What is the source for this though?  There is so much discussion on rules but I can't find the Fia regs on driving standards anywhere apart from a small clarification from a few years ago."", 'But those rules apply to the overtaker, not the defender. It seems like the responsibility falls entirely on the attacker, which we may or may not agree with, but that appears to be the current interpretation.', ""It does actually, part of the same rule that applies to overtaking this way also states that the driver being overtaken must also stay within track limits, it's posted with a link in another secondary comment here"", ""Don't bother presenting common sense to jobsworths."", 'Braking zone, per this reading, doesn’t matter at all.

# The Formation Lap

Gather ‘round racing friends, for the tires are warm and it’s time to hit the track… From driver news to team updates and technical tweaks, the ninth edition of *Last Week in Formula 1* is ready to take you on a hot lap.

Before we get started, if you missed last week’s issue [you can catch up here.](https://open.substack.com/pub/lastweekinformula1/p/last-week-in-formula-1-october-7-13-2024?r=4apk87&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true)

If you’re a rookie ‘round these parts and wondering what you're in for, *Last Week in Formula 1* is a weekly newsletter compiling the most interesting, important, and informative goings-on in the Formula 1 world.

# The United States Grand Prix



**Sprint Qualifying / Sprint Race:**

P1. Max Verstappen / Max Verstappen

P2. George Russell / Carlos Sainz

P3. Charles Leclerc / Lando Norris



**Qualifying / Grand Prix:**

P1. Lando Norris / Charles Leclerc

P2. Max Verstappen / Carlos Sainz

P3. Carlos Sainz / Max Verstappen



***LWIF1’s Reaction:***

Welp, the season that keeps on giving gifted us once again… I daresay Ferrari pulling out a 1-2 in a slow-burning psychological thriller of a race wasn’t on many folks’ radar (except for mine, given I stacked my fantasy lineup with both drivers, [and u/Derridizzle, whose poster prediction came true).](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g899sj/my_poster_prediction_came_true_i_also_did_the/)

One trend I’ve noticed about races at COTA, at least since 2021, is that they always have this subtle, slow-burning, intense edge to them—often without too much action through the middle portion of the race, but everything comes to life with great fanfare in the closing stages. Gotta love it!

***Personal highlights from Austin include:***

* Franco bossing his way up to P10
* Max’s stout defense against everything Lando threw at him
* Sainz steering away his engine issues to bring home a Ferrari 1-2
* George dancing his way from the pitlane to P6 (and ahead of Checo)
* And my fantasy drivers finishing in a spiffing P1, P2, P4, P5, and P10…

Before we move onto the rest of the week, here be the [post-Austin GP drivers and constructors standings](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8a4s0/drivers_and_constructors_standings_round_19/) as the paddock packs up and heads to Mexico.

\~\~\~

# The Drivers’ Mutterings & Musings

The battle for F1’s last available seat in 2025 drags on, and Valtteri Bottas, one of the contenders, is worried: [“I might not be here in 2025”.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g60y2d/valtteri_bottas_is_worried_i_might_not_be_here_in/)

One of Bottas’s adversaries in the battle for that lone seat is none other than the unexpected mid-season rookie who has knocked everyone’s socks off with his performances, Franco Colapinto. And James Vowles is pushing hard to get him into that coveted seat, [stating that “Colapinto should be in F1 in 2025, even if it costs us points.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g788lv/vowles_colapinto_should_be_in_f1_2025_even_if_it/) Silly season ain’t over yet, dear reader.

For a bit of driver news I’d love to see come true but likely won’t, Honda is allegedly pushing Red Bull to [give Yuki Tsunoda (what I think would be a) well-deserved test run.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7blz7/honda_pushing_red_bull_to_give_tsunoda_f1_test_run/) What more does the man need to do to have a shot?!

Not that it *really* matters at this point, but sometime last year… [Christian Horner *guaranteed* Liam Lawson a seat in 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g44633/christian_horner_guaranteed_liam_lawson_2024_f1/), which of course guaranteed implications on their existing driver lineup for both teams. The more beans that spill about the Red Bull/Toro Tauri VCARB driver rodeo, the more of a political, poorly handled mess the whole situation seems. Relatedly, [RB Team Principle Laurent Mekies certainly isn’t happy with how things went down.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7715a/we_should_have_done_a_better_job_team_principal/)

Max ‘Swear Bear’ Verstappen has stated that [he’ll continue dishing out minimal answers in the FIA press conferences](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6461f/max_verstappen_to_continue_giving_minimal_answers/) in protest of their, [as stated by George Russell, “silly”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6jpi3/russell_hopes_for_gpda_talks_with_fia_in_mexico/) swearing fiasco. [Max also dropped a hint as to how the FIA can end this war of words](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6gplg/max_verstappen_protest_to_continue_at_f1_us_gp/)—but will they listen? A man can dream…

\~\~\~

# The Teams’ Twistings & Turnings

For those of us F1 fans from roundabouts 2007, rejoice with me! For as I’m sure you saw, [McLaren blessed us with a bright’n’shiny splash of chrome in Austin,](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g4a4tc/mclarens_chrome_livery_for_the_2024_united_states/) a throwback to their much-loved chromed-out car from days gone by.

While not as personally exciting, it’d be unfair to swoon over McLaren’s holy chrome special without at least mentioning [Haas’s “screaming eagle” home race livery,](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g468ab/haas_reveals_us_grand_prix_special_livery/) or [Alpine’s Indiana Jones collaboration with Microsoft/Xbox.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g46z1p/road_to_cota_indiana_jones_and_the_great_circle/)

More hints of a messy Red Bull… [Darth Helmut Marko has admitted that the team’s structure is being rearranged](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g39u6z/helmut_marko_admits_red_bull_f1_organisation_is/) (read: the power struggle struggles on).

In a statement that should surprise nobody at all, [Mattia Binotto shared that turning Audi into F1 winners will be like climbing Mount Everest.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g3ezln/bbc_sport_mattia_binotto_says_turning_audi_into/) No shit, Sherlock! Climbing from P10 to P1 (or thereabouts) will take *years*, even with Audi’s impressive racing record, pedigree, and resource… [But perhaps the increased budget cap they’ve been granted will help.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g74dhq/audi_to_be_granted_increased_budget_cap_on/) Here’s to the journey!

***While not a team specific bit of news, all teams will be affected:***

As of next year, [the FIA are doing away with bonus point for fastest lap…](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g5vczi/f1_will_drop_the_bonus_points_for_fastest_lap/) With many coming to the conclusion that this change is in response to Danny Ric’s last lap glory run in Singapore. Hasta la vista! Relatedly, former F1 driver Pedro de la Rosa is quite pleased at the news, [buoyed with confidence and relief that his 2005 Bahrain racing lap record will stand for at least another year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6bjbk/pedro_de_la_rosa_this_gives_me_some_confidence/)

Following in the vein of the above, as the now-finalized 2026 sporting regulations come to light in drips and drabs, [the FIA has increased the requirement for fielding a young driver during free practice from once per season to twice.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g5y1hr/feeder_series_news_the_fia_has_increased_the/) Meaning, each regular driver will have to give up their seat twice per season, rather than just once. Good news for the younglings!

\~\~\~

# Technical Tidbits

In all their official officialness, [here’s the FIA’s breakdown of the upgrades each team brought to Austin—and boy, there’s a whole heap of them!](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6k8bn/teams_upgrades_for_the_2024_united_states_grand/)

***Now that some of the smoke has cleared around the accusations of Red Bull having an illegal ride height adjustment system, here’s the state of play:***

Red Bull does indeed have such a system on their car—which has been known to the FIA and other teams for three years. [According to the FIA, no violation has been found.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7by68/erikvharen_the_fia_has_stated_they_have_found_no/) However, courtesy of enough politicking and lobbying from McKaren Team Principle Zak Brown, Red Bull has [agreed on a plan with the FIA to make changes to their car with immediate effect…](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g5ylgd/thomasmaheronf1_red_bull_has_agreed_a_plan/)

And the accepted consensus around all this hubbub is that Zak has been trying to make noise and draw attention away from the fact that McLaren has had to revise *all* of their rear wing specs to remove the “mini-DRS” system they were caught using in Baku—which is illegal. Formula 1 is *so* back, baby! 

Courtesy of the ever-insightful technical anaylyst Giorgio Piola, [this article breaks down how F1’s teams have evolved their brake solutions during 2024.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g5jqu7/how_f1s_top_teams_have_evolved_their_brake/)

# Paddock Playtime

Should you feel so inclined, you can enjoy F1’s latest episode of [Beyond The Grid with Tom Stallard,](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g4zzhl/tom_stallard_piastris_olympic_silvermedallist/) Oscar Piastri’s Olympic silver medalist race engineer.

[Fashionista Lewis rocked the double denim](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g5upvz/lewis_arriving_for_media_day/) for media day in Austin.

Mercedes’ Team Principle [Toto Wolff appeared on CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g69inu/mercedes_f1_team_ceo_toto_wolff_on_the_business/) (whatever that’s supposed to be) to spill his insider cup of beans on the business of F1, the sport’s success in the US of A, and the growth outlook.

*Push Push!* [Mercedes sponsor WhatsApp collaborated with Lewis Hamilton to create a short film](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g6kj3c/push_push_short_film_with_lewis_hamilton/). Naturally, pregnancy jokes were birthed in the comments.

1g8xjg7,2024 Rookie Championship Battle,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8xjg7/2024_rookie_championship_battle/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8xjg7/2024_rookie_championship_battle/,2024-10-21,0 days,"Was looking at the driver standings after Austin and noticed that with only 5 rounds remaining, we could have a really promising rookie championship battle on our hands. 

As it currently stands:  
 - Bearman (7 pts)   
 - Colapinto (5 pts)  
 - Lawson (2 pts)

Ollie Bearman is the only one not currently racing in F1 and thus stands as a stationary target, but by claiming 7th place at Saudi, the other two will need to claim a total of 8 points to become the victor.

Franco Colapinto only needs 3 more points to claim the crown. Depending on the Sauber seat, he still may not make it onto the 2025 grid meaning he has nothing to lose in this race to the rookie title.

Finally, we have the latest 2024 debutant Liam Lawson. While the furthest behind, Lawson does have a faster car & more F1 experience than Colapinto. He will need to earn more than a point every round (beating what Ricciardo could do) to claim victory.

  
Who do you all think will be the 2024 Rookie Champ? 🤔","['Are we classing Lawson as a rookie? Technically he’s done 5 races in 2023 already', 'I think Franco Colapinto ends the season with 9 or 10 total points', 'IMO, Bearman will be able to hold on but there will be only 1 point between all of them (2007 style)', 'I think Franco might have chance on Bearman in Vegas, that should be a Williams track.', 'So different cars between them (like.. ollie scored points with a Ferrari...) and so different situations (some with more race days than others, Liam already having races on 2023). IMO this rookie champ is a kind of biased ranking.', ""It's definitely 50/50, personally I feel like he can still be counted as one."", 'Definitely possible, I really need to increase my expectations of him more as he keeps on surpassing them every race.', ""Sorry if it came across this way but I never meant this to be any kind of ranking or to determine who is better.\n\nI just noticed that the 3 new kids on the block could end on similar points come Abu Dhabi and wanted to hear people's predictions on who will end up on top."", ""I know it's a judgment call but putting him in the same category as Pinto does seem slightly unfair""]",6,12,2024-10-21 20:25:43, Discussion,4,8

Would such a solution not solve all these silly discussions for all these little incidents? If you’re on the outside, you know you are 1-0 behind unless your front wheel is basically in front of your opponent’s (Montoya Spa 2004). 

I think racing would be preceived far less ‘arbitrary’, with stewards not mingling with the outcome. 

Just my two cents… curious what you guys think!","[""I'm not sure this would happen. I believe Max mentioned the issues with this. Many circuits are used in disciplines other than F1—apparently, Motorcyclists and amateur racing leagues are not fans of gravel traps. And there is a significant cost to adding/removing gravel traps."", ""I'd go one step further. Instead of gravel, a lake. Ain't no one getting out of that."", 'Would be interesting. Would abrasive surface like at Paul Recard in France be enough of a detergent? Basically chew up tires but not have beached cars and spins', 'Not happening with a lot of f1/motogp track sharing', 'Ah, the weekly gravel trap post. \nThanks for your submission.', 'Venus fly trap > gravel trap', 'So that Max would have driven Lando into the gravel?', ""This is the problem with circuits that both host F1 & MotoGP. It's a huge problem for the circuit to balance out the needs for both series"", 'I agree. But firstly the FIA need to recognise that the viewers don’t want to see the bullies with the elbows pushing their rivals off the track. That currently seems totally off of the FIAs radar right now. Then once it’s recognised, the repeat offenders (and there’s one very obvious candidate I’m thinking of here) need to be punished properly so there is a lesson learnt.']",3,39,2024-10-21 20:25:43, Discussion,3,5

1g8w43j,F1 calendar idea - bring back non-championship GPs,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8w43j/f1_calendar_idea_bring_back_nonchampionship_gps/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8w43j/f1_calendar_idea_bring_back_nonchampionship_gps/,2024-10-21,0 days,"So, I think most people agree that 24 races is too many, and that young drivers aren't getting the chances they need these days. Which led me to think that we should bring back non-championship status for some races. Ideally we'd have 16 championship races and 8 non (all arranged by F1/FIA with the championship races rotating around), with the non-championship races having different rules (max 4 cars per team up to 26 entrants, no requirement for all teams to attend). This would lead to:

1) Better opportunities for young drivers - have 4 academy drivers you want to evaluate? Stick them all in a car for a race or two
2) Reduce the championship length (hopefully meaning we have fewer dead rubbers at the end of the year)
3) Smaller teams can avoid some of the expense of too many fly-away races by picking and choosing when they enter
4) FIA/F1 can try new ideas (reverse grids, two shorter races in one weekend) without affecting the sporting integrity of the championship

There's obviously need to be some serious consider given to how you keep the races out of the cost cap and part-usage rules, but even that might lead to some better racing as we could go back to kamikaze engines and driving right at the limit

Thoughts?","[""I'm not sure if team personnel would be particularly happy about having to go to 8 races that are inconsequential"", 'Why would teams build and enter two extra cars for races that have no impact on anything?', ""Most teams don't really have the resources to build up more than 2 cars. I don't think they would want to risk parts,  even if they don't count towards a limit on a non-championship race.  \n\nFans won't really want to pay as much to see if half the field is rookies or if the drivers aren't really into it because it doesn't mean as much. Venues won't want to host the exhibition events because it will be harder to attract fans or make as much money off the event."", 'There is too much money and logistics involved for one-off races.

I like the number of races this year had so 2 is a no for me and i don't care about 3."", ""That's a fair point - and everything's so specialised now that the days of someone doing a NART and using local pit-crew would be unfeasible"", ""NASCAR/IndyCar both get around it by offering stupid money for them, so that's always a possibility.\n\nYou could also factor in the testing ban so getting hundreds of laps of extra development time would be a bonus, as would the ability to properly analyse a young driver (don't forget Ferrari often had 5 cars pretty much race ready as they had 2 racecars, 1 T-car and two at Maranello for Badoer and Gene to use - an expense they justified to themselves with the stupid number of test miles they could run)\n\nAlternatively (and this gets around some of the cost cap/parts argument) you use last year's cars so the amount of extra building would be minimised."", ""They don't have the resources partly because we have 24 races strewn across the world. The ideal solution would just be to go back to 16/17, but that's not going to happen because money. So this was just a thought as to how to reduce the burden on the smaller teams whilst keeping the number of races for TV etc.\n\nAnd if you pitch things right exhibition events can get as big an audience - big money, some teams could choose to use a local driver to get interest e.g. try-out a Herta or O'Ward""]",0,13,2024-10-21 20:25:45, Discussion,0,2

All the talk about stewarding decisions taking the action and not the consequences into consideration is again bullshit as its not happening.

Why do not give Max a 5 sec penalty?. Would be just fair and consistend as Max was definitely in the wrong doing the same stuff as 3 other drivers that got a penalty.

There’s been a lot of negativity surrounding Norris lately (often times understandable of course) but at this point people are unfairly starting to doubt his pace. I just wanted to let some of his extreme detractors know to remember the pace he still has.

While Lando has made some errors, it’s not fair to act as if the McLaren is at the level of the RB19, and that he’s just slow. Oscar himself has as many points as Lando since Barca or something purely because of Lando’s Austria crash which was 100% not his fault. Ironically he was driving that race exactly how people seem to want him to, aggressively but as a result he was criticised for that drive.

I wanna say funnily enough Lando had a decent race and the first lap incident wasn’t even his fault. He had a better start than both verstappen and leclerc, and due to that if he did push max deep left, max was far enough behind to just go right and take it from the outside while Norris would be stuck taking the turn from a very disadvantageous angle. And max pushed him out so far it was insane nothing came of that from the race control, but I can understand to an extent because it was a first lap incident. There was literally nothing Lando could have done to stop the two Ferraris lol.

I’ll be the first to agree he is making mistakes recently but let’s not forget he was incredible all the way until Canada, very likely the second best driver at that point, and very mistake free. Since then it was a little iffy but allow me to make the case that it’s not as bad some think.

He made a crucial error in Barca and should have won that race. Grave mistake count = 1 (and the first of a very stellar season up until then). Austria was not his fault, he drove like we at Reddit want him to, aggressively and lost it due to something max did (not intentional of course). Then we get to GB, he was impeccable for a while, until his team made a call which let’s be honest Lewis was only able to make because of his vast experience, and I hope Lando learns over time too, but if you see the radio, it’s clear Norris was ready to go on the softs and it’s just as fair to blame him for this as it would be to blame leclerc for Canada. Hungary, yes he was faster at the end but I’m not gonna argue this, grave mistake count 2. Belgium, they had no pace. Zandavoort, another start error but he won (fine, count 3). Monza, it was clarified the start error was due to a glitch and the team really really fucked it. Baku, yellow flags, proven and done, had a stellar race. Singapore, he dominated lol. And I already explained COTA above, and he gets so much flak for the end when usually for any other driver it’s always the team that tells them to give the place back.

So he had 3 start errors, and he had a fantastic season apart from that and people are way too biased imo. Every driver except Charles and Max had less mistakes than that. It was a single type of mistake which he seemed to rectified. He even had the faster start yesterday.","['I have nothing against his pace.\n\nIt is his racecraft that is under scrutiny.', 'Lando is not a bad driver by any means. But he’s up against one of the greatest of all time. He has had the better car for quite some time now, but hasn’t been able to pull the championship towards him. That’s on him and his team. \n\nAlso, his pace was never the issue. He just isn’t as good as Max with regards to racecraft.\n\nAlso don’t agree that Austria was ‘100%’ not his fault.

He's had the fastest car for the majority of the year, and has managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory multiple times. He's a very good driver, but not quite at the level necessary to be a world champion right now. Hopefully this offseason will be his opportunity to make the leap necessary to genuinely challenge for a title next year, and hopefully McLaren (and their strategy team) are able to give him the tools necessary to do so. If Ferrari look as competitive as they have for the last couple of races, then that McLaren window of opportunity gets very small between now and the new regs in 2026."", 'Unfortunately for Norris it’s a racing championship not a time trial championship', ""He's had the fastest car since Miami and the gap is now four points greater than it was then. Your pace can look good, your qualifying can look good, it can all *look* good but ultimately it hasn't been all that.
