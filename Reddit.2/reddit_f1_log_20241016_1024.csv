1g4u500,[Giuliano Duchessa] I think it is important for Ferrari to check on a severe track what the Monza package and the Singapore wing are giving. I do not expect significant new parts apart from minor adjustments (upper flap for downforce). I do not expect Serra on track for this triple header.,https://x.com/GiulyDuchessa/status/1846452178598121504,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g4u500/giuliano_duchessa_i_think_it_is_important_for/,2024-10-16,0 days,,"[""What I'm getting from the tone of this tweet is that he doesn't know for sure yet. They're being more tight lipped than usual, Duchessa is usually pretty well informed"", 'To be fair it would be quite surprising if Ferrari has anything major left to bring this season.\n\nIf you look at the timeline, the Imola package was quite significant. Then they brought a new floor which threw them off balance for a while.\n\nThen they had some temporary fixes inbetween while trying to understand the root cause and finally brought quite a significant change for Monza.\n\nIt might not have looked as such, but the underfloor was almost entirely different.\n\nAnd in Singapore they brought the more loaded front wing (but also more flexible, like McLaren), something they had been working on ever since asking FIA clarification regarding McLaren‚Äôs front wing flex.\n\nAfter all that, it‚Äôs unrealistic to expect another significant upgrade. The surface aero has remained relatively unchanged which shows they‚Äôre happy with it and as for the floor, more than 3 big changes in one season is a bit too much.\n\nThey‚Äôre also limited somewhat by their suspension (not confirmed, but there are words going around they are looking to change it for 2025), as well as the inherent problems with tire warmup that this platform was developed on.\n\nI would be very surprised if Ferrari manages to bring another huge upgrade this season, considering all what I said + budget cap and wind tunnel hours which at this point might be more usefully spent on trialing 2025 ideas.']",45,3,2024-10-16 10:24:34, News,18,0

1g4l9tw,How to invite former F1 drivers/people to podcast?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g4l9tw/how_to_invite_former_f1_driverspeople_to_podcast/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g4l9tw/how_to_invite_former_f1_driverspeople_to_podcast/,2024-10-15,0 days,"Hello, I'm Micha≈Ç, sport journalist from Poland. I have been involved in sports journalism for years - mainly volleyball, basketball and F1. Over the years of working for various websites, I managed to arrange interviews with many F1 drivers - among others Mario Andretti, Jody Scheckter, Thierry Boutsen, Derek Warwick, Robert Kubica, Nick Fry, Sebastien Buemi, Mario Theissen, Mika Salo. I think that over the years there have been 20+ people related to F1. All of them were published in text form on Polish websites. I suspect that the desire to talk was due to the reach of the sites I worked for, and not because of me personally.



For over a year now, I have been running my podcast (a modest project, 32 podcast episodes so far), in which I have not yet had a guest from F1. Most of them are volleyball and basketball. However, I would like to talk to someone from F1. While I know that it is very difficult to get in touch with people from the current F1 environment, theoretically it should be easier with former drivers, bosses, directors, etc. It should be, but it isn't, because unfortunately I am either ignored or rejected due to my small reach. In many cases I cannot find a contact (I often used IG, FB or websites of drivers or their companies to contact me).



Can anyone advise me on how I can get more F1 contacts or encourage F1 people to join my podcast? Sending links to previous interviews doesn't seem to work. Thanks in advance for your help. Greetings from Poland.","[""PR people are your best bet. but as youve pointed out the reach of the sites that you've worked for is probably more of a factor rather than yourself as a journalist, sorry to be blunt. regretably its a numbers game, current drivers only have so much time in a day and they'll prioritise the outlets that will give them the most reach for publicity \n\ni think youre better off trying to find someone whos not a driver currently, or someone who works/worked in f1 not as a driver. cold calling is probably the way to go if you dont have contacts already. keep talking to as many as you can, get as many people on there as possible, build interest and reach. the people you interview could eventually be a new contact to someone else, who knows. \n\nrandom names i can think of:\n\n- gunther steiner (dude is promoting his book now iirc)\n\n- hanz harald franzer (his kid makes tiktok videos featuring him) - probably butchered his name sorry \n\n- former/current mechanics, other team folk, i dunno maybe a chef... people who dont usually get interviewed and can afford to make time for you. i feel like this is your best bet tbh\n\n- other journalists, you could pitch it as an episode of two journalists talking to each other about your experiences in your respective sport (ie: your experience talking to people in volleyball/basketball)\n\n- i think some photographers might give it a go. jamey price + kym illman are very active on social media. \n\nall the bestttt"", 'I am connected through LinkedIn to several motorsports people. \n\nAre your podcasts in Polish or English?', 'No comments üò≠üôè']",0,3,2024-10-16 10:24:35, Discussion,0,3
