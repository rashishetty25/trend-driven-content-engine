*But* that penalty was inconsistent to what we’ve seen recently - most notably t1 with Norris and Verstappen. So, for the purpose of this post let’s ignore Russel’s penalty as that’s another whole discussion.  

If the rules for the most part are that you can get away with that then why is that the case?
You can just go into a corner and escort your opponent wide? What’s with that? - we will never see any interesting racing.

Especially when the driver that’s been pushed off can’t even fight back because they’ll get a penalty for “keeping the position by going off track” when they had nowhere else to go. 

If it were up to me you’d have to leave a cars width to the car on the outside, when overtaking and defending, as is the rules in most other respects of motorsport afaik. 

Am I alone in thinking this?
