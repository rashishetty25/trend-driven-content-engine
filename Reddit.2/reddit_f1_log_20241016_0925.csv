1g4u500,[Giuliano Duchessa] I think it is important for Ferrari to check on a severe track what the Monza package and the Singapore wing are giving. I do not expect significant new parts apart from minor adjustments (upper flap for downforce). I do not expect Serra on track for this triple header.,https://x.com/GiulyDuchessa/status/1846452178598121504,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g4u500/giuliano_duchessa_i_think_it_is_important_for/,2024-10-16,0 days,,"[""What I'm getting from the tone of this tweet is that he doesn't know for sure yet. They're being more tight lipped than usual, Duchessa is usually pretty well informed"", 'To be fair it would be quite surprising if Ferrari has anything major left to bring this season.\n\nIf you look at the timeline, the Imola package was quite significant. Then they brought a new floor which threw them off balance for a while.\n\nThen they had some temporary fixed inbetween while trying to understand the root cause and finally brought quite a significant change for Monza.\n\nIt might not have looked as such, but the underfloor was almost entirely different.\n\nAnd in Singapore they brought the more loaded front wing (but also more flexible, like McLaren), something they had been working on ever since asking FIA clarification regarding McLaren’s front wing flex.\n\nAfter all that, it’s unrealistic to expect another significant upgrade. The surface aero has remained relatively unchanged which shows they’re happy with it and as for the floor, more than 3 big changes in one season is a bit too much.\n\nThey’re also limited somewhat by their suspension (not confirmed, but there are words going around they are looking to change it for 2025), as well as the inherent problems with tire warmup that this platform was developed on.\n\nI would be very surprised if Ferrari manages to bring another huge upgrade this season, considering all what I said + budget cap and wind tunnel hours which at this point might be more usefully spent on trialing 2025 ideas.']",27,3,2024-10-16 09:25:18, News,17,2

1g4uik6,The sprint race point allocation needs to be revamped,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g4uik6/the_sprint_race_point_allocation_needs_to_be/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g4uik6/the_sprint_race_point_allocation_needs_to_be/,2024-10-16,0 days,"Sprint races are usually 1/3 of the distance of a normal race, so it would be logical to assume that awarding around 1/3 of the points of a normal race would be the right way to go about things, but this doesn't make sense in the context of a few things:

* The winner hardly gains a point advantage over say the 3rd or 4th, while in the normal race they get around the double their points

* There are only 6 sprint races in 24-25 race calendar year, which automatically makes the logic behind the 1/3 rule fall apart and devalues it further

* There's no real incentive to push 100% when the difference per position is only 1 point apart

* Cars are so reliable these days that the top 8 are almost always firmly locked in place

* FIA wants sprint races to matter, but the risk is not worth the reward with the current point system and infrequency of sprint races

* Smaller teams either get punished or have no chance to score points, since there's way less to gain for them compared to a normal race

* FIA wants sprint races to be their own special event so why do you apply a copy & paste full race logic in terms of rewards to something that works differently

Here's a proposed suggestion to revamp the point system:

>Current point system: 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

>Revamped point system: 20, 15, 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Advantages:

* The winner gets a clear point advantage over the rest

* Points are given to the Top 12

* More incentives to fight for positions

* Top teams and smaller teams are both rewarded more

* Sprint races actually have an effect on the world championship

* Teams are more likely to come up with bold strategies and we get more exciting races since the Top 12 get points now and finishing higher rewards way more points","['Terrible idea', 'Can we please stop proposing ways of making sprint races more significant than they are?\n\nIf we have to have them, I want them to be as inconsequential as possible, ideally.', 'I would revamp them into the bin', 'Woo, another ""my idea to improve sprint races"" post.""', 'Honey, wake up.
