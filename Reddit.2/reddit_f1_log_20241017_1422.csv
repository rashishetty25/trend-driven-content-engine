I pulled a few different regulatory eras and tried to look at the third year of relatively stable rules, like we have now (except 2012, when I just went for the competitive 4th season).

I looked at number of winning cars and drivers, gap between the top 3 in the WDC (percentage of leaders points P3 has) and the gap between the entire field in qualifying. (I excluded any obviously erroneous results such as vastly different weather between Q1 and Q3 or cars multiple seconds away from the pack). **All data was taken for first 16 races only to make it measurable between seasons.**

|Era/Year|# Winning Teams|#Winning Drivers|Gap Between Top 3|Gap Between 1st and last Quali|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Ground Effect - 2024|4|7|72%|2.45s|
|V6 Turbo - 2016|2|4|71%|4.68s|
|KERS - 2012|4|7|78%|6.14s|
|3l V10 - 2002|3|4|35%|4.94s|
|No Driver Aids - 1996|3|4|61%|6.57s|
|Ground Effect Ban - 1986|4|5|96%|10.56s|

This season looks to be up there on all metrics apart from gap between the top 3 in the table at this stage of the season.

But what is staggering is how tight the whole field is compared to any other era, I saw some people calling Sauber ""a joke"" in another thread and this proves just how good of a job Sauber are doing compared to backmarkers of yore. The gap between P20 and P1 in Bahrain this year would have put you 6th on the grid in 1986's opener.","[""Sauber being a joke is definitely relative.

Members of Congress in the United States of America wrote [letters to the anti-trust division](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5509739/2024/05/21/andretti-global-investigation/) of the DOJ, as competitive clauses could have been violated if FOM rejected the bid (or a majority rule of F1 teams, ect) rather than reject on merit. \n\nThe case itself is hinging on the fact that FIA had previously approved Andretti's bid and it was FOM that rejected Andretti for the 2025/2026 season start. Andretti wasn't completely rejected and is going to be re-evaluated with GM as a partner for the 2028 season. As noted by the speedcafe article, rejection by FOM and not the FIA is contradictory to the 2001 European Commission agreement made previously that FOM would not be making decisions in entrant's bids to F1."", 'The LiveNation case is really the one that the DOJ shouldn’t lose.
