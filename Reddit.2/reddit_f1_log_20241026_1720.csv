The line oft repeated is that each position in the championship is worth millions to the teams, however, with the 2026 regulation change looming, and the fact that teams are unable to work on the 2026 cars until the 1st of January 2025, it's made me begin to wonder if finishing 3rd in the WCC might benefit Red Bull in their preparations for the regulation changes.

Each position lost gains a significant extra chunk of wind tunnel runs and CFD time. Is this enough of a benefit for 2026 that it outweighs the financial penalty of finishing further down the table and thus means Sergio's lack of performance is being left unaddressed?
