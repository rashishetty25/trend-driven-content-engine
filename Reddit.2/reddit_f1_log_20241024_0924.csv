First, I want to emphasize that the intention of my previous post was not to single out Verstappen negatively. In fact, I respect Verstappen as an exceptional talent who pushes the boundaries of the sport.

So, by request, here's a deep dive into the rules that have been changed or clarified solely because of Lewis Hamilton's actions.

- - -  

**1. Gaining an Advantage Off-Track Clarification**

Race: 2008 Belgian Grand Prix


Incident: Hamilton cut the chicane while battling Kimi Räikkönen, allowing him to overtake. He let Räikkönen back past but immediately overtook him again at the next corner.

Rule Clarification: The FIA clarified that if a driver gains an advantage by leaving the track, they must not only give back the position but also ensure they do not retain any lasting advantage. Immediate re-overtaking or benefiting from a better position due to going off-track is prohibited. This clarification aimed to ensure fairness in racing duels.

**2. Emphasis on Honesty with Officials**

Race: 2009 Australian Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton and his McLaren team were found to have provided misleading information to the stewards regarding an incident under the safety car involving Jarno Trulli. Initially, Hamilton told the stewards he did not deliberately let Trulli pass, leading to Trulli's penalty. Later, radio transmissions revealed that Hamilton had been instructed to let Trulli pass.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced the requirement for absolute honesty in all communications with the stewards. Providing misleading information resulted in more severe penalties, including disqualification.

**3. Ban on Excessive Weaving to Defend Position**

Race: 2010 Malaysian Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton weaved multiple times on the straight to break the tow from Vitaly Petrov, who was attempting to overtake. This was deemed dangerous and unsportsmanlike.

Rule Change: The FIA expanded the rules on defensive driving, stating that drivers are allowed only one move to defend their position per straight and prohibiting excessive weaving to impede another car. This was introduced to enhance safety and ensure fair competition during overtaking maneuvers.

~~**4. Restrictions on Helmet Design Changes**~~


~~Implemented: 2016 Season~~

~~Incident: Hamilton frequently changed his helmet designs, making it harder for fans, commentators, and officials to identify drivers quickly.~~

~~Rule Change: The FIA introduced a rule starting in 2016 limiting drivers to one helmet design per season, with exceptions for special occasions. This aimed to improve driver recognition.~~

(*Edit: as pointed out by several users, the rule on helmet restrictions was primarily driven by the actions of Sebastian Vettel, rather then Hamilton*)

**5. Reinforcement of Pit Entry and Exit Regulations**

Race: 2018 German Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton aborted a pit stop entry by cutting across the grass to rejoin the track, crossing the pit entry line, which was against the rules.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced existing rules prohibiting crossing the pit entry and exit lines, emphasizing safety concerns. Drivers must commit to the pit entry once they cross the commitment line and cannot rejoin the track. This clarification ensured consistent enforcement of pit lane regulations.

**6. Podium Attire Regulations and Political Messaging**

Race: 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton wore a T-shirt on the podium that read ""Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor,"" highlighting social justice issues.

Rule Change: The FIA updated podium and pre-race regulations to prohibit drivers from wearing clothing with political or personal statements during official activities. Drivers must wear their race suits fully zipped up during podium ceremonies and official interviews. The aim was to maintain political neutrality during official events.

**7. Jewelry Ban Enforcement**

Race: 2022 Miami Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton wore jewelry, including piercings and necklaces, while driving, despite existing regulations prohibiting jewelry for safety reasons.

Rule Enforcement: The FIA decided to strictly enforce the existing ban on wearing jewelry during competition, requiring drivers to remove all jewelry before sessions. This emphasized safety concerns, as jewelry can hinder medical procedures or pose additional risks during accidents.
 

**8. External Assistance Rule Change**

(*suggested by /u/EndiKopi*)

Race: 2007 European Grand Prix


Incident: During the race, Lewis Hamilton crashed and required assistance to be lifted back onto the track using a tractor.

Rule Change: Following this incident, the FIA changed the rules regarding external assistance during races. Drivers are prohibited from receiving outside help (such as tractors or other vehicles) to get back onto the track after a crash. Any external assistance provided during a race would result in penalties, emphasizing that drivers must recover on their own or with help from their team within the pit lane.


- - - 

It's interesting to note that despite his 18 years driving in Formula 1 (so far), it looks like only three rule changes or clarifications have been made solely as a result of Lewis Hamilton's driving.

Feel free to discuss or point out any additional rules I might have missed!","['Now do Schumacher 😂', ""Wasn't there one in 2007 when Lewis came back to the track with the help of a tractor and then the external help rule had to be clarified?\n\nEdit: European GP 2007"", 'Jewelery ban was dope.. I remember Lewis showing up for a press conference with 4 watches', ""Not saying it had nothing to do with Hamilton but wasn't the helmet one changed mostly because of Vettel?"", 'Number 1 was of note since the clarification was made after the race, then the penalty applied in retrospect.', 'Pretty insane that 1/4 (or could say 3/8) of the rules changed due to lewis are just about his choice of style and clothes. The FIA really does hate to see it', 're: rule 7, i thought a few drivers used to race wearing necklaces and rings, not just hamilton, right? i mean i remember there as a whole debacle because they tried to explicitly ban piercings whilst allowing wedding rings for example. also rule 4 is funny bc nowadays he rarely does special helmets', ""**4. Restrictions on Helmet Design Changes**\n\nI'm pretty sure it was Vettel that prompted this.\n\nHamilton may have added things here and there and occasionally wore special helmets for a given race weekend but fundamentally Hamilton stuck with a fairly consistent design for the season\n\nbut it was Vettel who would show up with a completely new and different helmet design each race weekend making it hard for people to identify the driver."", 'Number 5. Was because of Rosberg during the British GP because he could not change gears anymore and his engineer coached him not to use a certain gear anynore and how to skip that gear not Hamilton. Rosberg got a penalty for it that caused the reevaluation and removal of that rule. \n\nHamilton had trouble with the same rule in Baku because he changed a setinh by accident and could not find his way through the software to fix it. But that did not change the rule as Hamilton was not coached and did not recieve a penalty for it.']",2021,333,2024-10-24 09:24:36, Discussion,21,4

I was a driver living out my dream: racing in Formula 1, my first race… and I would say I didn’t have a clear roadmap for my career. I didn’t know exactly what my next race would be, nor which team I’d be with,"" Alonso commented on the Beyond The Grid podcast.\n\n""I was improvising. Every weekend was a new adventure. When I won the championship in 2006 and joined McLaren, I had a three-year contract: 2007, 2008, and 2009. And I was 99% sure that 2009 would be my last season in F1. That was my plan, a very clear plan in my head. I won the championship in 2005 and 2006, signed with McLaren for three years, and that was my last contract in my mind,"" he added.\n\nBut what was the exact reason Fernando Alonso was considering retiring after the 2009 season? The truth is that, once he had achieved his dreams, he thought he would expand his record with the Woking team and then start a new life… but reality was very different, and the troubles at McLaren were constant in 2007. Fortunately, he changed his mind, and we still have Fernando in F1.\n\n""I don’t know. Maybe there wasn’t any specific reason for it, but when I signed that contract, it was a three-year deal, and in my head, at that time, it felt like a long-term contract. And okay, three years might seem long, but this would be the last one. I had already fulfilled my dream,"" Fernando added.\n\n""I won the championship twice. This went beyond my wildest dreams, you know, becoming a Formula 1 champion. So, what else was there for me to do here? When I signed this contract with McLaren, I expected to win more races and championships, but after Formula 1, there’s a different life outside.""\n\n""Beyond racing, I was thinking I’d have a family and do normal things, live normal days. As for your question, I don’t think the Fernando of 2001 would have thought anything strange about the 400th Grand Prix, because I wasn’t thinking much about the future. But in 2007, it would definitely have been a surprise,"" Alonso concluded.', ""I imagine he would've retired had he won with Ferrari as well.

His career had many ups and downs (mostly downs, unfortunately) but his longevity and passion made him a proper legend of the sport. After his WDC years, his ferrari stint was incredible, the constant fights, hero drives and heartbreaks. No WDC to take away but anyone who was invested in the sport and watched around that time will know just how good he was then. The memes his 2nd mclaren stint spawned are quoted and joked about this day and the exhilarating emotion of seeing him take the fight to the front in the small window that the aston was actually good, was nothing like I experienced in this sport since I've started watching 3 decades ago. He reached over 100 podiums (hell, even took one in the alpine in 2021, it felt absolutely unreal at the time) which I was really doubting would ever happen. \n\n\nTo me, its just insane to think that this guy has been driving long enough that he's able to talk about what it was like to go toe to toe with The Michael, while still actively driving and putting in great results (when the car allows it)."", 'He definitely would have retired sooner if he won with Ferrari in 2010 or 2012.\n\n  \nThat second McLaren stint always felt like a bit of a desperate move.', 'Thank god he didn’t because we wouldn’t see his Ferrari stint then', 'The quote is taken directly from the latest Beyond the Grid podcast, no need to look at translations. \n\nYou can listen to it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMki0medimg)', ""Since watching in 1999, 2012 is the only result I'd change.

The OP’s asking a genuine question, as fans we should be happy to share our views/knowledge on the sport.', ""1. Compared to other circuits, Mexico is particularly dusty/dirty in FP1 so it's not very representative anyway.\n\n\n\n2. It's a short, simple track, which means it's easier to make up for lost time both in terms of track learning and track time, because you can set more laps on a 1m20s circuit over 60 minutes than a 1m30s or 1m40s circuit.\n\n\n3. FP2 is extended this year so compared to other circuits the main drivers are only missing 30 minutes of total practice time (3hrs vs 2.5hrs)"", ""Not commenting on the question, I think that's a fair one to ask, but I have a counter question: where did you get that list of drivers?\n\nAs far as I can tell, you've got half of them wrong. Sauber is (for some godforsaken reason) not fielding Pourchaire but instead going with Robert Shwartzman, Vesti and Doohan aren't making appearances.

There's also a Pirelli tire test in FP2, so it's really not an ideal place for a rookie FP1. Regardless, this late in the year, the only options left without sprints are Mexico, Vegas, and Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi will definitely have the most, but teams have to do one for each car, and most don't want to do it the same race- though Red Bull did last year. Last year obviously no one would do Vegas since it was a new track. It's still only the second year of the track, but I'm curious to see if any rookie fp1 will happen. So, Mexico is the best one left.\n\nTeams don't usually want to do them early for a variety of reasons.

Just made a simple table of head-to-head race results between Nico and his teammates over all his F1 seasons so far. Nico is an interesting F1 driver for me. It's like he is the definition of a premiere midfield driver. When he is teamed with low-tier drivers like di Resta, Gutierrez, Palmer, Magnussen, he beats them handily. But when he is teamed up with drivers who at one time or another in their career became multi-season Driver 2 of top-tier teams like Sainz, Perez, Ricciardo, Barrichello, he gets beat. It's almost like Nico is a good benchmark to test if your driver is good enough to be a Driver 2 for an elite team, but Nico himself seems to not be good enough to be considered in that tier.

I once thought that his record of most races without a podium is a matter of being in a non-podium capable car. Checo did manage to get four podiums as his teammate so it may not be just because of the strength of the car he has driven in his career.

As we know final standing doesn\'t tell the full story.\n  \nI say this because I remember Hulk having a pace advantage over Sainz and beating him with some margin so I checked and sure enough Hulk is placed higher than Sainz in the championship in their full season together. Kind of an oversight to not check the wdc standings no.  The H2H is skewed due to a DNF classified as a finish due to 90% rule and probably some bad strat or error. Hulk did have the pace over Sainz. \n  \nAlso we can\'t really consider Hulk\'s time in the Racing Point as a fair representation as he was a last minute replacement in all scenarios with barely any testing or practice.  \nEven then he outqualified Stroll in both occasions and almost out raced him in 1 if not for the suspectful unplanned pitstop. One race he DNS for an ""engine issue"" as well (yes tinfoil hat conspiracy from my side) .   \n  \nIn his Force India days he was pretty even on race pace with Per, but a better qualifier. They say Hulk was disadvantaged due to the regs at the time which handicapped bigger drivers. I dunno how true this is tho. Regardless, the final H2H with Per just came down to who was in front, neither had a definitive pace advantage over the other. Tho Per was the more aggressive driver which gave him an edge.   \n  \nIn the same vein I\'d say Di Resta wasn\'t all that bad. Hulk was the better driver but DiResta wasn\'t having his ass handed to him.  \n  \nI\'d say the only drivers to beat Hulk is Barichello and Ric. Tho Hulk was beating Ric at the start, Ric was easily better by halfway+ thru the season.', 'This shows he’s in the Sainz/Perez/Ricciardo range. Not bad, really, all race winners. He never was able to pick a team good enough for him to really show off (although was he sometimes shows in the Haas is pretty impressive).', 'Not representative with dnf and dns', 'Why have you included DNF/DNS in the race head to head? It makes 2018 look a lot closer and 2015/16 a lot worse for Hulkenberg because he suffered 11 DNFs in those 2 years compared to Perez’s 2.', ""Head to head race record is possibly one of the most useless stats you can possibly find, especially in the midfield where many teams take risks to score points that they wouldnt otherwise. Risks can go wrong and driver 2 who didnt take a risk took p12 while driver 1 took a risk which failed ended p16. Sure driver 2 takes a win here in the teammate battle but is it one that actually matters? Not really. That meaningless win is worth just as much as driver 1 finishing p6 with driver 2 finishing p11. When the reality is that 8 points are worth a ton for any midfield team and makes a massive difference in the constructors standings, it affects price money, it affects a teams ability to attract sponsors. \n\nTwo much more telling stats would be quali head to head (as this one actually matters and theres not many excuses for consistent losses) and points. Points arent perfect either but certainly better than head to head race results, there is really no good stat for races, maybe average finishing position. \n\nAnd the drivers you group together are questionable. I wouldnt group Barrichello, Perez, Ricciardo and Sainz together. As for Barrichello, this was literally Hulks rookie season, you wouldnt really put too much stock in this one and they only spent a season together. As for Saint, he literally beat Sainz. He beat him in quali and he beat him points wise. How can you call this a win for Sainz when Hulk literally outqualified and outscored him? Even Ricciardo is not entirely fair as the car was shit while Hulk was leaving. Fairly early on because the 2019 car was far worse than the 2018, they spent most of 2019 experimenting in priority for the 2020 car. They often split strategies between the drivers with Hulk often getting the worse strategy as he was the leaving driver, the priority was clear in Canada as Hulk was faster but team orders were made that made sure Hulk stayed behind Ricciardo. Im not saying Hulk is a better driver, that was prime Ricciardo but im saying he wasnt exactly given a fair chance. \n\nThe only teammate we can draw more proper conclusions is Perez as they spent 3 years together. Hulk was a better qualifier but Perez had the race magic, he was better on the tyres and had some really high peaks but overall both were very equally matched. However, this is now 8-10 years ago. Barrichello is long retired, Perez is about to retire, Ricciardo has just driven his final race, Hulk outlasted both, only Sainz is still hot but he's about to drive for Williams and Sainz is the one he actually beat. \n\nHulk is genuinely having one of his best seasons currently and his value is oddly now higher than some of the rivals that beat him. He never won a race, not even had a podium, he probably still is highly motivated"", 'Anyone else read this and just kept thinking about the average scene from idiocracy? \n\nhttps://youtu.be/s3tFv9IOPP0?si=AzzLD807hyR68oMD', 'Hulkenberg vs Di Resta evolved massively across the year. In the first seven races, Di Resta beat him 6-1 in races and 21-7 in points, but then then Hulkenberg turned the tables massively from Valencia onwards, beating him 10-2 in races and 56-25 in points. It’s not clear why there was such a massive swing in form. Perhaps Hulkenberg took a while to get back up to speed after his year out in 2011.', '> Kind of an oversight to not check the wdc standings no\n\nBut on the other hand standings can be influenced by *where* you finished in each head to head.

1ga7bhc,How the tyres will work in FP2 in Mexico? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga7bhc/how_the_tyres_will_work_in_fp2_in_mexico/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga7bhc/how_the_tyres_will_work_in_fp2_in_mexico/,2024-10-23,0 days,"Hello,

In Mexico, there will be a tyres test in FP2. How will it work? Pirelli wrote the following on its website, but it looks a bit difficult to understand. Can someone make it easier to understand the full process? 

>  
The first day of track action, Friday 25 October, will be slightly different to usual. The second free practice session will be entirely given over to validating the softer compounds in Pirelli’s 2025 range (C4, C5 and C6) in what is known as an in-competition test. The session is extended by 30 minutes to 90 and all drivers and teams will have to follow a specific programme established by the Pirelli engineers. Apart from the dry tyre allocation specifically for the Grand Prix (two sets of Hard, three of Medium and seven of Soft, one less than usual), each driver will have two additional sets of tyres: one will be identical to the one available for the weekend, to act as a *baseline*, while the other will be a 2025 prototype *option,* both in terms of compound and of construction – actually the latter already homologated back in September.

>These two sets will not have any sidewall colour bands. The plan is for the programme to include a performance run and a long run for each set, with every team running the same number of laps with the same quantity of fuel on board, dependent on the type of run. The only exception will be in the case of a regular race driver being replaced for FP1 by a young driver. These race drivers will carry out the Pirelli test for 60 minutes of FP2 only and will have an additional set of Medium compound tyres to catch up as much as possible on acquiring data for the rest of the weekend. All the test data will then be analysed by Pirelli engineers to fine tune the characteristics of the compounds prior to the group test in Abu Dhabi, which starts on the Tuesday after the final round of the 2024 championship. It means that teams will have to prepare their cars for qualifying and the race in the space of two hours: FP1 on Friday and FP3 on Saturday.","[""Basically FP2 will be replaced with a tyre test. Pirelli will bring one new type of tyre, intended to replace one of the compounds for next year. For the sake of explanation, let's say they bring the tyres they're planning to use for C2 next year. \n\nEach team will get a set of the current C2 tyres as well as a set of the prototype C2s and will have to do as close to identical runs on each set as possible so Pirelli can compare the behaviour of the prototypes with the existing tyres.\n\nThe only exception is if a driver has missed FP1 because of a rookie. Then they'll get 30 minutes to do whatever their team wants before doing the Pirelli test for the remaining hour."", 'Should really be called Not-Free Practice 2', ""So it seems that the Pirelli test will take all 90 minutes of FP2, each driver will have to do a long run and a short run on a baseline set, which will be a tyre from this year, and then the same on a test set for next year that Pirelli give them. There's a baseline and a test set so that Pirelli can see the difference between this year's tyres and next year's. These run plans are set by Pirelli: numbers of laps, pace, fuel levels etc. to give Pirelli the data they want for the test tyres.\n\nWhen it comes to a driver who is replaced by a young driver in FP1, they'll do a shorter program which will only take 60 minutes, giving them 30 minutes and an extra set of mediums to do some of their usual quali/race prep."", 'Most will go in circles and get changed from time to time', ""I'm guessing this all goes out the window if it rains."", '90 minutes of track action as a lead in to the World Series…Here for it', "">The only exception is if a driver has missed FP1 because of a rookie. Then they'll get 30 minutes to do whatever their team wants **before** doing the Pirelli test for the remaining hour.\n\nafter. This has been changed since last year. And although they could do whatever they like on paper, everyone must return a previously unused set of Mediums after FP2. So they are basically sure to use only those."", 'Thanks a lot. So they will know which tyre they are testing or not?', 'The FPs have always just been Friday Practice to me.\n\n*What about FP3?*\n\nDoes anyone watch FP3']",9,18,2024-10-24 09:24:52, Discussion,1,0

No new PU because of the cost cap, it\'d only improve lap times ""fractionally"" but has big impact financially so the trade is not worth it (info: remember his current PU is fresh having done the Baku race, Singapore weekend and up to Saturday, FP1, Sprint Quali and Race, and only Q1 in Quali).\n\n\n- Q: Why the difference in performance between Sprint Quali and the rest of the weekend?\n\n\nA: Allison\'s guess is that they ran the cars a bit too low, which improve lap times but also makes the car more unstable and sensitive to bumps and cross-winds if you push your luck too much, which they did.\n\n\n- Q: What was Lewis\' suspension issue and was it fixed for the race?\n\n\nA: A bearing holding a wishbone in the front suspension had started to break-up, leading to rear looseness and instability. It was fully fixed for qualifying and the race.\n\n\n- Q: Why did George have to start from the pit lane?\xa0\n\n\nA: After his crash they had to work on the car outside the authorized hours, triggering an automatic start from the pits.\n\n\n- Q: Did the car have the pace to finish on the podium?\n\n\nA: Allison\'s opinion is no, although they had similar pace to McLaren and Verstappen, P6 was the best the car could get, they\'d have just finished closer to the front pack.\n\n\n- Q: Did the upgrades deliver and what were the problems?\n\n\nA: Yes, the expected downforce was there. The data didn\'t show any issues prior to any of the spins. Less time to dial in with one practice session and the spins in FP, George\'s crash and Lewis\' spin on Sunday.\nThey are still excited about the new package and the issues were most likely down to running the car too low, too stiff, compromising the handling beyond what was acceptable.', ""How can James say there was no reason to think Lewis' setup needed to be changed when Lewis himself said his setup needed to be changed because the balance was all over the place?\n\nJust say the engineers all needed to fix George's car and move on, no need for smoke and mirrors."", 'We have Lewis and George at home\n\nLewis and George at home:', 'oh my God I snorted hahahha', 'Thank you!', ""Lewis wasn't the only one saying that. Shovlin and Toto did, too. Shovlin even said Lewis' car was still struggling with balance after qualifying.\n\nApparently, the floors in the new upgrades are the one they tried to use in Spa but took them out because they couldn't get it to work right. I think they are desperate to get this upgrade to work with the car and just keep pushing it because it would be a waste of time and money otherwise."", ""Yeah, these have become less informative lately. Seems like they're trying to smooth over their mistakes instead of explaining them like they used to do. \n\nThey had multiple reasons to start Hamilton from the pit lane, they were dreadful in race pace during the Sprint, and Lewis damn near qualified last for the race, while George smashed his car into a wall. \n\nI can't understand how James can say they had no reason to change Hamilton's setup and have him start in the pit lane.\n\nLewis literally said that was the only way to have a shot on Sunday, which turned out to be true, as George did very well, albeit with the old parts on the car, whereas Lewis spun off all by himself. \n\nWhich is only the 2nd time that's ever happened to him, the other being the final lap of the 2009 Italian Grand Prix when he was fighting Button for a podium.""]",2,8,2024-10-24 09:24:52, Video,0,0
