Given Lando's pace at the end, the time loss against Verstappen, and any potential damage, it's not unreasonable to think Norris could have won this race with Verstappen 4th, behind the two Ferraris and Lando. If this happened, Verstappen would have dropped 13 points. Instead, he loses just 10 points to Lando. I appreciate it's not a huge difference, but it makes me wonder if it was part of his mindset going into this race.

Edit: I know we saw similar with Hamilton in 2021 as well. Should this lead to discussions about the time of penalties awarded? Should time penalties be served sooner (like the old 3 laps to serve a stop/go), should you be allowed to change tires at the same time?

Like Lando said before, Max doesn‚Äôt care where he finishes, as long as he makes it as hard as possible for Lando', ""It's arguable whether he would have caught Sainz without being held up, but it was clear that his priority was fucking Norris race at all costs and he was happy to crash as long as it was with Lando"", ""Max's only objective is to make life hell for Lando.

1gdmvx6,How on earth can RB retain Perez in 2025?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gdmvx6/how_on_earth_can_rb_retain_perez_in_2025/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gdmvx6/how_on_earth_can_rb_retain_perez_in_2025/,2024-10-27,0 days,"

By now, there shouldn't be any smidgen of doubt that RB needs to part with Checo Perez.
He is not able to extract any sort of performance from the RB20.
It's getting ridiculous how big the gap has become with Max... and the rest of the field.

Realistically, I think there's only two options: either promote Lawson or Tsunoda to RB.
Tsunoda in that respect is, although talented,  bit erratic in his driving as of late.
Lawson on the other might be the best choice IMO. Of course he's not that experienced yet (so there's always the danger of a Gasly, Kvyat or Albon scenario at RB), but he drives calmly and smart.

A swap with one of them is not an option I think for Perez. That would be an embarrassment, frankly.

What do you think?","[""They can't.\nIf they keep him, Max is 100% not winning the championship.\nThey can't handle 2 competing McLarens and Ferraris with no backup driver support."", 'They absolutely can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs costing the teams millions, literally‚Ä¶ third in a drivers championship they could‚Äôve won is losing them a fortune\n\nAnd redbull needs to look at the future‚Ä¶ Max is very clear that he won‚Äôt stick around when he would be considered old, he‚Äôs not a fernando or a lewis‚Ä¶ Redbull needs someone to take over the team when Max leaves‚Ä¶ they can‚Äôt afford to wait till Max is gone to start looking for a new potential world champion', 'Such a performance on a home race must be absolutely ridiculed. No excuses left, I can‚Äôt imagine what RB is thinking.', 'Ricciardo was binned so Lawson could audition.

They could have had literally else in that car by now but I guess they think the money must be worth having a bottleneck. Like, how badly managed do you have to be to have two teams and somehow still not enough seats because one of the big ones has to go to a pay driver. Fuck that felt good, this forza ferrari thing feels great lol', 'My guess is that Perez is still there because there might be a slight possibility that Max might leave if they loose both titles. On the surface everything looks fine at Redbull but below that is probably lots of discontent with how things are going and the drama from the start of the year is also still lingering.\n\nI still see Max out if he looses the WDC either still to another team which boots one of their current drivers or taking a sabbatical or even retire with all the bullshit going on recently with the FIA etc.\n\nSo Redbull hang on to Perez as they can use the cash and they do want atleast one driver in 2025 who knows the team and the car so they can better prepare for 2026.\n\nBut lets see maybe im wrong but I still have the feeling we have not seen all from what still is awaiting Redbull ones the titles are both lost and the infighting really starts.']",293,200,2024-10-28 14:24:06, Discussion,3,2

This is de Zordo's first year, behind a new Principal, and he has delivered the goods with the upgrades Haas has received all year.  Komatsu is doing a great job as principal, but I wanted to shoutout de Zordo too because Komatsu can keep the team organized and all pulling in the same direction, and that's great, but without competent technical direction it's hard to imagine a team going from P10 to P6 with as few resources to work with as Haas has.

With Simone Resta, the relatively well-regarded technical chief from previous years, moving on to greener pastures at Mercedes this year, it would be easy to imagine Haas technical direction taking a step backwards this year.

Jokes aside, how do these meetings pan out? What kind of plans do they discuss? Maybe I'm wrong but it must be depressing to discuss different plans when the whole camp must know they will come in pretty much last place. I don't watch DTS but I've followed Williams on and off through periods where they were struggling for many races to get a single point - but at least they were tantalisingly close. With Sauber they seem to be in a much worse situation this season.","['Williams had years where they were in the same position, 2019 was like this.\n\nTheir strategy is likely going to be focused around waiting for safety cars, trying to make the most of potential rain, keeping clean and hoping something big happens up front that helps them luck into points.', ""Hard to say, I've never been in one"", 'Probably not different than any other team. Just trying to optimize what they have.', 'Probably about what their next Instagram race poster looks like', 'Do good in the race and try to get points. \n\nIn racing you always want to go forwards. If your going back, then your slow or spun out/crashed', 'The smaller teams or midfield teams at an unsuitable track probably think about unique things that could happen in the race and how they can form alternative strategies. \n\nIf your not scoring points with a normal strategy you have nothing to lose doing something else.', ""They're just slow, which boxes them in to strategies that look like they don't work. This is what Sainz said about that kind of situation at the Japanese post-race press conference early this year. For context, if you need it: last year people were saying Ferrari strategy was terrible but this year they improved a lot. \n\n>   **Autosport:** Ferrari seem pretty strategically sharp in this race - it's been something the team's been criticized for a lot in the past - I just wondered could you to expand on any particular work you've seen the team doing and how pleased you feel about that?\n\n>   **Sainz:** I think we made some progress on strategy over the last three years progressively but if you see a jump this year on strategy it's purely down to the car. I think just having a car that allows you to have flexibility on strategy is something that last year we couldn't have, so we were boxed in to stop at certain laps, we couldn't extend, we had so much deg that it looked always like people could extend and then come back on us on a harder tire. Last year we were just zero flexible and we couldn't do anything with our racing so it looked like we were not getting the strategy right a lot of times. But when you have a car that is better on tyres, two drivers that can push on the car more often, and you have that extra flexibility, your strategy also looks better. And with this I'm not underestimating the progress we've done, it's just I really think this helps a lot."", ""Look at Haas now. Look at Haas in 2021.\n\nThings turn around quickly. It's evident that Sauber are just laying low until Audi come in."", 'Really good, great communication, clear plans, honesty about the limitations of their car and realistic expectations before they come up with the best possible option \n\nUnfortunately, they always forget to invite the drivers, strategists and team leaders']",13,22,2024-10-28 14:24:42, Discussion,4,7

However, if a sports league deviates from its rules and practices in a way that reduces competition and reduces consumer interest in the product, the collusion may constitute anticompetitive conduct.""

Yes, Cadillac do have the V-Series.R in IMSA and the World Endurance Championship, but that car is built by Dallara and is run by Chip Ganassi Racing under the Cadillac Racing banner. Cadillac bankroll the project and the car carries their name, but they don't have the day-to-day oversight of the team or the experience to do it. So in the case of Formula 1, Andretti would build the chassis and run the trackside operations while Dallara would build and provide the engines. Exactly how this would have been branded remains to be seen. As for why they would do it this way, there are two obvious advantages: first, they can pitch it as an American team using an American engine, which they couldn't do if they were just supplying an engine to another team. Secondly, they would have more direct control over how the team is run. Andretti might be overseeing the day-to-day stuff, but Cadillac would have a seat at the table for the big decisions that they wouldn't get elsewhere without buying a team out."", 'That is not the point. In fact that is exactly why this becomes an issue. If a firm can tell their customers who to buy from and restrict their customer\'s choices (eg if you buy my car, you are not allowed to buy tires from some other manufacturer other than the one I chose) then it runs the risk of anti-trust. \n\nIf Cadillac and Andretti both are separately qualified to do their parts as stated by the FIA, Liberty saying ""we\'ll accept Cadillac if they abandon Andretti"" is EXACTLY why this becomes anti-trust.', ""MLB, in fact, has some form of anti-trust exemption from 100 years ago through the US Supreme Court. It isn't lost on the government that some sports leagues do, in fact, run afoul of anti-trust. They are limited but allowed some leeway in collective action which would otherwise be subject to anti collusion laws. \n\nFor example, the league may set total payroll caps but I believe they cannot interfere with individual salary negotiations between a team and a player.""]",2,23,2024-10-28 14:24:42, News,2,1

Max - 8 poles - 7 wins - 3 losses from pole - 2 wins without pole.

Charles - 3 poles - 3 wins - 2 losses from pole - 2 wins without pole.

Lando - 6 poles - 3 wins - 4 losses from pole - 1 win without pole.

George - 2 poles - 1 win - 2 losses from pole - 1 win without pole.

Carlos - 1 pole - 2 wins - 0 losses from pole - 1 win without pole

Oscar - 0 poles - 2 wins - 0 losses from pole - 2 wins without pole

Lewis - 0 poles - 2 wins - 0 losses from pole - 2 wins without pole.


This is common knowledge but still wanted to highlight. 
Lando stands out. 4 losses after starting in pole in a good enough mclaren.
Either lando is super good in quali or just loses the temperament in the race. There are other factors at times with luck. But max is ruthless when he is ahead. Even charles is there or thereabouts.

In general, very hard to win wdc with this conversation. Basically just depends on others falling back.

","['Lando is super good in quali. He never lost H2H with a team mate in quali. And absolutely dominated Ricciardo and Oscar.', ""None of this factors in the state of play at the time of these poles.\n\n6 of Max's poles came in the first 6 races where McLaren, Ferrari and Merc really weren't competitive and everyone thought 2022 and 2023 were being replicated. The gap between the Red Bull and everyone else was larger than whatever gap McLaren (or Ferrari) have had when they've objectively been the quickest.\n\nPeople compare this season to 2009 for good reason. If Max holds on, it's because of the opening races being dominant whilst the rest of the season saw multiple teams squabbling over wins.\n\nFerraris update after the summer break has been Red Bulls biggest friend so far. Without it, Lando is probably 20-25 points behind Max currently. But it also means that if McLaren can get ahead of Ferrari, it's a horrendous scenario for Red Bull as you're potentially looking at 5th place.\n\nLando has not been anywhere near good enough at converting his poles though. That isn't to be questioned. But comparing the different points of the season as equal is misleading."", 'Hes good but its hard to say since he never had an actual strong qualifying teammate like max or leclerc, or even russell', 'This is simply not true. Zandvoort, Singapore, and even like Hungary have been as dominant if not more. \n\nSpain should have been as well. Even Silverstone would have been a dominant win if you put Verstappen in that McLaren. Look at the pace Piastri had at the end, and in the wet they had no competition either.

If that somehow makes you feel like you're better than others, I'm happy for you.\n\nBut with so many great drivers at the front and the competition so enjoyable this season, I'm finding myself wishing Verstappen was just out of the picture as the battles and action between everyone else would probably be amazing.
