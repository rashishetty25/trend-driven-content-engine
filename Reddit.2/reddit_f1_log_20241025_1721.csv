However, the latter option raises a dilemma: what happens if the rookie proves to be as capable as the two main drivers? Another proposal is to implement stricter licensing requirements, establishing higher standards that drivers must meet to continue racing in F1.

But after checking in the [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/en/drivers/fernando-alonso) and [Stats F1](https://www.statsf1.com/en/fernando-alonso.aspx) websites, I've realized that this weekend is NOT his 400th GP start, but rather his 400th GP entered.

  
In reality, Alonso is currently at 396 races started. It's important to clarify that the differences in races entered and races started is marked by the DNS (Did not start), which by its own definition doesn't count as a started race. During Alonso's career there have been 3 DNS.

  
1. Belgium 2001: This one is pretty interesting, since Fernando actually started and did 3 laps before retiring due to a broken gearshaft. In lap 4 there was a massive crash between the Prost of Burti and the Jaguar of Irvine which triggered a red flag. Following the regulations of the time, the first 4 laps were voided, meaning that officialy, Alonso never started the race.

2. USA 2005: Well, this one is mostly known, but after issues with the Michelin tyres during practice, all teams using them pulled in at the end of the formation lap and did not start the race, including Alonso.

3. Russia 2017: Engine issue during the formation lap which forced Alonso to fail to start the race.

  
All of this means that Alonso is currently sitting at 399 entered GPs and 396 started GPs. This weekend will be his 400th **entered race**, and if he manages to start all the following races, **he will start his 400th race in Qatar**.","[""Y'all ruin everything. You were supposed to wait until he retires with 500 GP starts THEN bring this up, so he has to come back and complete his last 3 races to earn the title, Mr. 500."", "">he will start his 400th race in Qatar.\n\nWe'll see about that, hope he feels better for FP2."", 'I am impressed he didn’t suffer from any engine DNS with the amount of time he raced for Renault/Alpine.', 'LOL F1 Instagram [stories](https://imgur.com/a/DUD6voG) setting the record straight', 'This is silly, it\'s his 400th GP, which is a full weekend, made up of multiple stages\n\n400 ""Starts"" is being taken too literally as in just the Race part of the weekend, other sites have it listed as his ""400th GP Weekend"". \n\nI\'d argue though, once you are entered and the weekend has started, that counts as a GP start, regardless if you DNS the actual race, but idk how the stats are looked at', 'These milestones are always marked by number of races entered rather than number of races started. And I’d argue in Alonso’s case since he at least started the formation lap of all three races he’s had recorded as a DNS, it’s pretty disingenuous to argue that this weekend isn’t his 400th race.', 'Hmm. \n\nSainz recently had his 200th (200rd? 😄) race and I remember they must have taken his DNS stats into consideration because he started on the exact same race as Max but their 200th races were a few races apart.', ""If you count Sprints (which I know we don't, don't throw hands at me) then he's surpassed 400 even without the DNSs"", ""Technically, and specifically, correct.

Two separate divebomb moves, the latter with NO chance of making the corner himself, and yet no penalty. \n\n\nFix that system and we won't see this issue again"", ""The more words they write in the rules, the more there will be ways to game the situations.  It's a catch 22.  Either you make more loopholes that can be exploited, or you let stewards rule more subjectively, and then complain when their opinion doesn't match your expectation."", 'A few comments here saying that rules should be amended so that Max has to leave the space for Norris in this situation.\n\nI don’t think that was the problem in this incident. The problem was that Max was able to boost his defence by leaving the track. Leaving the track, notwithstanding being forced off by another driver, should NEVER be rewarded by the rule book. \n\nIf Max had stayed within the track, got to the apex first, I have no issue with him not affording Norris space. The problem was staying within the track was not compatible with getting to the apex first. This should have been penalised but is possibly a grey area in the rules', 'I think we all do. The problem is the FIA is seemingly incapable of making consistent judgments. Max floors it off track and overtakes in Austria, no penalty. Lando overtakes off track in Austin, penalty.', 'Can’t we all agree that while we have a framework of rules, many decisions—especially in close racing—will always be subjective? It’s impossible to write a rulebook that covers every situation perfectly. Stewards should have the ultimate authority in such cases.\n\nTake the Lando and Max situation, for example. Lando had the better run into the corner, and if telemetry shows he would have made the corner if Max hadn’t forced him off, then it’s clear-cut. If Max eased off his brakes more than usual to stay ahead and caused the contact, it’s simple: give Lando 5 seconds for overtaking off track and Max 5 seconds for forcing him off. The penalties cancel each other out, and they race on.\n\nThe rule about being ahead at the apex is fine, but Max’s move wasn’t “in the spirit of the rules.” Formula 1 has used that term before—why not apply it to driving? If you manipulate your braking just to be ahead, you’re not following the spirit of the apex rule and should be penalized.\n\nI don’t see why the FIA needs to complicate things by searching for black-and-white rules for every situation.', ""The major thing that needs to be enforced is consistency in stewarding. If they decide to be sporadic about their rulings, any rule enforcement, whether old or new, can be bent to fit the situation at hand. \n\nIt's funny how the FIA is willing to put up with the vitriol behind these controversies sometimes. Similar situations have transpired over the years, team personnel and media aficionados have called for transparency in ruling, yet it doesn't feel like anything has changed. And I doubt this situation is going to start any changes of the sort"", ""My opinion is they should go back to something like this:\n\nIf you choose the inside line, you must:\n\n* Make the corner fully within the track limits.\n* If the other car has their front wing alongside your cockpit at the apex, you must leave half a car's width to the white line to allow for the other car to make the corner as well\n* If you do not leave the space, the other car has the right to continue off track to maintain position. If it is a corner where this is not possible, sort the matter out or it will be referred to the stewards.\n\nAs the leading car this means you can reasonably defend by taking a slightly tighter line, without the risk of being mugged down the inside by someone braking all the way to the exit curb. You still have to defend, but if someone wants to dive bomb you, you can still fight for your spot.\n\nIf you're trailing on the outside, you make a decision at the apex as to whether or not you can fight for the exit curb or not. If you're leading or roughly alongside, you can expect to always have the faster exit out of the corner.""]",283,94,2024-10-25 17:21:04, News,6,0

1gbsett,Surprisingly few: All the F1 rules changed or clarified because of Sebastian Vettel since 2007,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbsett/surprisingly_few_all_the_f1_rules_changed_or/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbsett/surprisingly_few_all_the_f1_rules_changed_or/,2024-10-25,0 days,"Earlier threads:
https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9dt5h/with_calls_for_new_rule_changes_after_verstappens/
https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga7lqk/by_request_i_also_compiled_all_the_f1_rules/

After compiling lists of rule changes and clarifications prompted by Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton, several users suggested I create a similar breakdown for Sebastian Vettel. However, in researching Vettel’s career, I discovered that while he was certainly involved in high-profile incidents, relatively few resulted in formal rule changes or FIA clarifications directly because of his actions.

In fact, only two racing incidents directly led to regulatory changes or clarifications. 

- - - 

**1. Team Orders and the “Multi-21” Incident**

Race: 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix

Incident: During the final stages of the race, Red Bull instructed Vettel to hold his position behind teammate Mark Webber using the ""Multi-21"" code. Ignoring the directive, Vettel overtook Webber, leading to significant tension within the team and sparking wider debates on team orders in F1.

Rule Discussion: Although the incident did not result in a formal rule change, it led the FIA to reinforce its stance that team orders were permissible within teams but that the enforcement was up to the teams themselves. This set a precedent for how team orders would be handled going forward, emphasizing FIA neutrality in intra-team directives​.


**2. Helmet Design Restrictions**

Year Introduced: 2015

Incident: Known for debuting new helmet designs almost every race during his time with Red Bull, Vettel’s constant changes created issues with driver recognition, particularly for fans and officials who sometimes found it difficult to identify him on track.

Rule Change: To enhance driver visibility and consistency, the FIA implemented a rule limiting drivers to a single primary helmet design per season, with allowances for one special event helmet. This rule was a direct response to (mostly) Vettel’s frequent design changes and aimed to maintain a consistent look for each driver throughout the season.​
​

**3. Track Re-Entry Safety**

Race: 2019 Canadian Grand Prix

Incident: Leading the race, Vettel ran off-track under pressure from Hamilton. When he rejoined, his manoeuvre forced Hamilton to slow to avoid a collision, leading to a five-second penalty that cost Vettel the race win and sparked intense debate about fair re-entry practices.

Rule Clarification: The FIA responded by clarifying its rules around track re-entry, specifying that drivers must rejoin the track safely without impeding others or forcing them to change their racing line. This clarification helped to set clearer expectations for safe re-entry in similar scenarios going forward​.
​

**4. Advocacy for Consistency in Stewarding**

Years: 2020-2021 (Various races)

Incident: Over multiple races, Vettel vocally criticized inconsistencies in stewarding, especially concerning track limits, penalty decisions, and race director judgments. His frustration highlighted the need for uniform rule enforcement and drew attention to the impact of inconsistent decision-making on race outcomes.

Rule Discussion: Although this advocacy didn’t lead to any specific rule change, it fueled discussions around fairness in penalty application and contributed to a broader movement for consistent rule enforcement. The FIA ultimately restructured its approach to race direction following the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, suggesting that Vettel’s efforts may have nudged F1 in a more consistent direction​.


**5. Concerns About the Virtual Safety Car Loophole**

(*edit: added after suggestion by /u/cafk)*

Year: 2021

Incident: Vettel voiced concerns about drivers exploiting loopholes in the VSC system, specifically how some were gaining an unfair advantage during race situations. He emphasized the need for clearer rules to maintain fair competition.

Rule clarification: Following his remarks, the FIA acknowledged these concerns and committed to reviewing and addressing the VSC system to close any loopholes, showcasing how Vettel's advocacy influenced ongoing discussions about rule enforcement in F1.

- - - 


To give a fuller picture, I’ve also included some debatable cases where Vettel’s actions sparked discussions or reinforced existing rules but I believe did not prompt specific rule changes or clarifications.

**Debatable Incidents Not Included:**

**1. Multi-Weaving in Defensive Moves**

Race: 2012 Italian Grand Prix

Incident: Vettel’s defensive move at Curva Grande pushed Fernando Alonso off-track, leading to a drive-through penalty.

Reason Not Included: The penalty reinforced the “one-move” rule in defensive driving but did not prompt a new rule or a further clarification on defensive tactics.

**2. Collision with Hamilton Behind Safety Car**

Race: 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Incident: Believing Hamilton had brake-checked him, Vettel collided with Hamilton under the safety car and pulled alongside to express his frustration, which led to a time penalty.

Reason Not Included: Although it reinforced standards of sportsmanship under caution, it did not lead to a formal rule change or clarification. The FIA upheld existing standards on conduct during the safety car without redefining them.

**3. Overtaking on Pit Lane Entry**

(*edit: added after suggestion by /u/cafk)*

Race: 2016 Chinese Grand Prix

Incident: While entering the pits, Vettel overtook ~~Daniil Kyvat~~ Jenson Button and Carlos Sainz on the pit lane entry, highlighting an ambiguous area in the rules regarding overtaking in non-race conditions like pit lane entry.
Outcome: Although Vettel’s maneuver raised questions and sparked discussion about whether overtaking should be restricted in the pit entry area, the FIA chose not to issue a clarification or rule change at the time.

1gbuo3i,A Clarification on the Current Driving Standard Guidelines,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbuo3i/a_clarification_on_the_current_driving_standard/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbuo3i/a_clarification_on_the_current_driving_standard/,2024-10-25,0 days,"The [2022 Driving Standard Guidelines](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/doc_2_-_2022_imola_event_-_fia_f1_driving_standard_guidelines.pdf) document is something I see being referenced a lot here and thought it might be helpful to clarify that it is **no longer used** by stewards.

Before the 2024 season the FIA announced [here](https://www.fia.com/news/fia-drivers-committee-delivers-driving-standards-guidelines-circuit-racing-championships) that these guidelines have been updated and will be incorporated into the sporting regulations for the 2025 season. Annoyingly though they decided not to publicly publish this new document, which is now what they are referencing in stewarding decision documents.

Thankfully we are roughly aware of what the changes are from what some journalists have mentioned, a [The Race](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/little-known-new-f1-rules-already-affecting-racing/) article here mentions some of the adjustments. One of the most relevant changes to the Norris-Verstappen incident was the fact that the following line was removed from the ""Overtaking on the Outside"" section:

>The car being overtaken must be capable of making the corner while remaining within the limits of the track

This clears up some confusion on why Verstappen wasn't punished as well as Norris. I still don't necessarily like these guidelines however I don't see it mentioned enough here that the 2022 document is outdated and no longer used.

Edit: I think because of my flair people are presuming I am defending or trying to argue about the specific incident. I don't really care about it, this is just information I thought more should know about.","[""The race is not the definitive source.\n\nThe document is 6 pages.\n\nAutosport are reporting that the following is contained regarding defence.\n\n> While Norris clearly did not fulfil the guideline's criteria to be ALONGSIDE his rival at the apex, equally there is a question over Verstappen’s defence.\n\n> As the guidelines clearly state: “If, while defending a position, a car leaves the track (or cuts a chicane) and re-joins in the same position, it will generally be considered by the stewards as having gained a lasting advantage and therefore, generally, the position should be given back, as prescribed in the rules. It will be the sole discretion of the Stewards to determine if the driver of a car is “defending a position.”\n\n> So, are we in a world where if Norris had stayed on the track and aborted his move, then Verstappen would have had to give up the place and Norris would have been better off?\n\nFundamentally this would be a lot easier if the full document was published but we have to go off of snippets the media share rather than the entire thing. Also the media are not always great at interpreting the rules properly. Look at the confusion in Japan 2022 about Max actually winning the WDC that Johnny Herbert picked up on but nobody else did."", 'Nice !', ""The public doesn't have access to the current rules of the sport? this is ridiculous"", ""Norris was capable of making the corner. Max wasn't."", '> The 2022 Driving Standard Guidelines document is something I see being referenced a lot here and thought it might be helpful to clarify that it is no longer used by stewards.\n\nDo you have a direct source for that? The decision document for Norris\' penalty says ""under the Driving Standards Guidelines"", without any indication of a version.\n\nWithout a FIA document saying ""the 2022 Driving Standards Guidelines no longer apply"" it makes more sense that the 2022 version is active than the 2025 version.', 'Why would a perfectly reasonable expectation on the overtaken party be removed is the better question.\n\nIm also not convinced this was ever in the orig overtaking rules.

His team mate Frentzen was one of the best drivers of the 90s and he doubled his points. Williams had the clear best car, but not dominant. Newey wasn't around that year as he was on gardening leave."", 'You could argue that Villeneuve made too many mistakes to make it close. Car performance should have had Williams walk the title. Schumacher maximised every race he finished in, possibly only mistake was Austria with the yellow flag. And of course Jerez.', 'In a decade that has Senna, Mansell, Prost, Berger, Schumacher, Piquet, Alesi, Hakkinen, Hill, Barichello and Coulthard to say Frentzen was one of the best is not accurate.', ""Williams got rinsed when it came to the development race. The year started out with Villeneuve outqualifying the entire field by 2 seconds in Australia, but Ferrari closed that gap down at a rate of knots. Certainly by the second half of the year the difference in performance between Williams and Ferrari was small enough that Schumacher's talent advantage could make up the difference.\n\nWilliams actually had to pause development on their 1998 car to bring upgrades to the FW19 to prevent the title slipping away, which also explains why the 1998 car ended up so undercooked."", ""Yes, he made a few mistakes, but still smashed his team mate. Hyper focusing on mistakes loses the full picture, because despite the mistakes his best performances make up for it. \n\nI think, herein lies the crux of the issue. Villeneuve loses from being compared to Schumacher. Obviously Schumacher was the best driver in 1997 by a clear margin, but that doesn't mean Villeneuve didn't have a strong season himself. I doubt any driver in 1997 would've done better in that Williams apart from Michael himself."", ""Really? I implore you to check out Frentzen's record against his team mates. It's sublime. His only bad seasons relative to his team mates are 1997 and 2001.\n\nOut of all those drivers, I would definitely put Senna, Prost, and Schumacher above Frentzen. The rest are either on par or below.\n\nCoulthard? Not a chance. Doesn't even belong in the conversation."", ""That's more on Williams than Ferrari to be fair then. Schumacher was the better driver that season. Villeneuve also got lucky a number of times with retirements giving him wins in Silverstone, Luxembourg and even Hungary with Hill's problem he wasn't on to win any of those races."", ""Possibly I guess we'll never know but whilst Villeneuve outscored Frentzen almost double the points it was arguably a bad season for Frentzen, possibly his worst and he suffered more mechanical woes than Villeneuve did. I reckon Hill in that Williams would have secured the title before the final race."", ""My point is that this (seemingly quite common) idea of Villeneuve almost squandering a title when his car was miles ahead of anything else is based on extremely surface-level reading of the season.\n\nOverall the Williams was the best car of the year, and early on it *was* miles ahead, but it didn't stay that way for long at all. There were plenty of races in the middle and second half of the season where the Williams was just legitimately slower than the Ferrari and even the McLaren, even if overall it was the fastest car.""]",1,15,2024-10-25 17:21:14, Video,-2,10
