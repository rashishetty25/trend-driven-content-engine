","['Widely depends on the circuit and what picture you are expecting.\n\nBut a Polaroid shutter speed is usually pretty low. So if you are close, and in a not-so-slow part of the circuit, you are doomed.

You can get really close to the cars and it will be amazing on Polaroid.', ""From the tracks I've been to (Silverstone, Monza, Spa, Spain, Zandvoort) I'd say your best options with GA are:  \n\nSilverstone - Luffield. There's a spot very close to the track that is GA, where the cars are at their slowest. In practice and out lap/in lap for quali that means they're going very slow round there. \n\nMonza - Hard because T1 grandstand would be the best for the speed.   \n\nSpa - you might get some cool shots down the Kemmel when cars slow for faster cars in quali.   \n\nSpain - I only had grandstands so unsure.  \n\nZandvoort - Grandstands again."", 'Depending on the track again but your best bet would be during practice or a slow lap during qualifying. A GA pass for the day will be cheaper than race day. You can then party pick the driver you want and track them around the track.', 'Don‚Äôt bother trying if you go to Monaco - they are REALLY good at blocking all possible vantage points close to the track unless you pay a massive amount of money for tickets there. You might be able to get tickets for pitwalk and take photos there, but Monaco wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice without a long lens.', 'I‚Äôve never found Polaroid to be good for motion or distance.

So it's really more of an experiment to see how they turn out/what I can do in terms of cool shots with settings. Not expecting much, but hoping to learn out alot. \n\nI'm more curious about how close I can get at certain circuits. With the newest generation of cameras they've adapted the shutter speed to be faster. so so motion is possible, but still not great lol.""]",5,24,2024-10-19 22:22:33, Discussion,1,0

He is considered very supportive and nice, which I think are traits that people overrate in terms of helping rookie develop. The real development happen on track and imo it should be a team that is supportive not neccesarily the driver. After Sainz performance in Sprint today it got me thinking. Colapinto would benefit much more from a driver that ""races him hard"" and is ""selfish"" which is Sainz. Albon imo is really timid both in terms of personality and driving. He also can't handle pressure well and it is becoming much more obvious by every week. It was never about Williams being low pressure environment which helped Albon to show his potential but feeling no pressure because of his underwhelming teammate. As for other qualities Sainz is very smart with reading races and strategies. His abilities in developing a car and giving feedback are similar to Albon's or even better (he is in F1 since 2015). I get that Albon is nice and doesn't make excuses. But everyone would prefer fast driver who blames everyone than a average driver who always says it is his fault. Maybe unpopular opinion but even for a rookie  it can be beneficial to have a teammate who sometimes wrongly blames him for crashes etc. (assuming the team is supportive and Williams is). As it forces a rookie, firstly to be more self-critical, secondly to analize his performance better, more critically and teach him faster how to stand up for himself ","[""You're getting all of that from one sprint race?"", ""Fucking hell.
