1gb8cq6,About Alonso's supposed 400th Grand Prix start this weekend,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb8cq6/about_alonsos_supposed_400th_grand_prix_start/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb8cq6/about_alonsos_supposed_400th_grand_prix_start/,2024-10-24,0 days,"This weekend is marked by the celebration of Alonso's 400th GP, which is an impressive number never achieved before. But after checking in the [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/en/drivers/fernando-alonso) and [Stats F1](https://www.statsf1.com/en/fernando-alonso.aspx) websites, I've realized that this weekend is NOT his 400th GP start, but rather his 400th GP entered.

  
In reality, Alonso is currently at 396 races started. It's important to clarify that the differences in races entered and races started is marked by the DNS (Did not start), which by its own definition doesn't count as a started race. During Alonso's career there have been 3 DNS.

  
1. Belgium 2001: This one is pretty interesting, since Fernando actually started and did 3 laps before retiring due to a broken gearshaft. In lap 4 there was a massive crash between the Prost of Burti and the Jaguar of Irvine which triggered a red flag. Following the regulations of the time, the first 4 laps were voided, meaning that officialy, Alonso never started the race.

2. USA 2005: Well, this one is mostly known, but after issues with the Michelin tyres during practice, all teams using them pulled in at the end of the formation lap and did not start the race, including Alonso.

3. Russia 2017: Engine issue during the formation lap which forced Alonso to fail to start the race.

  
All of this means that Alonso is currently sitting at 399 entered GPs and 396 started GPs. This weekend will be his 400th **entered race**, and if he manages to start all the following races, **he will start his 400th race in Qatar**.","["">he will start his 400th race in Qatar.\n\nWe'll see about that, hope he feels better for FP2."", ""Y'all ruin everything.
