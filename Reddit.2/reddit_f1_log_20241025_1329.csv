But after checking in the [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/en/drivers/fernando-alonso) and [Stats F1](https://www.statsf1.com/en/fernando-alonso.aspx) websites, I've realized that this weekend is NOT his 400th GP start, but rather his 400th GP entered.

  
In reality, Alonso is currently at 396 races started. It's important to clarify that the differences in races entered and races started is marked by the DNS (Did not start), which by its own definition doesn't count as a started race. During Alonso's career there have been 3 DNS.

  
1. Belgium 2001: This one is pretty interesting, since Fernando actually started and did 3 laps before retiring due to a broken gearshaft. In lap 4 there was a massive crash between the Prost of Burti and the Jaguar of Irvine which triggered a red flag. Following the regulations of the time, the first 4 laps were voided, meaning that officialy, Alonso never started the race.

2. USA 2005: Well, this one is mostly known, but after issues with the Michelin tyres during practice, all teams using them pulled in at the end of the formation lap and did not start the race, including Alonso.

3. Russia 2017: Engine issue during the formation lap which forced Alonso to fail to start the race.

  
All of this means that Alonso is currently sitting at 399 entered GPs and 396 started GPs. This weekend will be his 400th **entered race**, and if he manages to start all the following races, **he will start his 400th race in Qatar**.","[""Y'all ruin everything.

And I’d argue in Alonso’s case since he at least started the formation lap of all three races he’s had recorded as a DNS, it’s pretty disingenuous to argue that this weekend isn’t his 400th race.', 'Hmm. \n\nSainz recently had his 200th (200rd? 😄) race and I remember they must have taken his DNS stats into consideration because he started on the exact same race as Max but their 200th races were a few races apart.', ""If you count Sprints (which I know we don't, don't throw hands at me) then he's surpassed 400 even without the DNSs"", ""Technically, and specifically, correct.

The problem was staying within the track was not compatible with getting to the apex first. This should have been penalised but is possibly a grey area in the rules', 'I think we all do.

If it is a corner where this is not possible, sort the matter out or it will be referred to the stewards.\n\nAs the leading car this means you can reasonably defend by taking a slightly tighter line, without the risk of being mugged down the inside by someone braking all the way to the exit curb. You still have to defend, but if someone wants to dive bomb you, you can still fight for your spot.\n\nIf you're trailing on the outside, you make a decision at the apex as to whether or not you can fight for the exit curb or not.

It’s impossible to write a rulebook that covers every situation perfectly. Stewards should have the ultimate authority in such cases.\n\nTake the Lando and Max situation, for example. Lando had the better run into the corner, and if telemetry shows he would have made the corner if Max hadn’t forced him off, then it’s clear-cut. If Max eased off his brakes more than usual to stay ahead and caused the contact, it’s simple: give Lando 5 seconds for overtaking off track and Max 5 seconds for forcing him off. The penalties cancel each other out, and they race on.\n\nThe rule about being ahead at the apex is fine, but Max’s move wasn’t “in the spirit of the rules.” Formula 1 has used that term before—why not apply it to driving? If you manipulate your braking just to be ahead, you’re not following the spirit of the apex rule and should be penalized.\n\nI don’t see why the FIA needs to complicate things by searching for black-and-white rules for every situation.', ""The major thing that needs to be enforced is consistency in stewarding. If they decide to be sporadic about their rulings, any rule enforcement, whether old or new, can be bent to fit the situation at hand. \n\nIt's funny how the FIA is willing to put up with the vitriol behind these controversies sometimes. Similar situations have transpired over the years, team personnel and media aficionados have called for transparency in ruling, yet it doesn't feel like anything has changed.

1gbsett,Surprisingly few: All the F1 rules changed or clarified because of Sebastian Vettel since 2007,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbsett/surprisingly_few_all_the_f1_rules_changed_or/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbsett/surprisingly_few_all_the_f1_rules_changed_or/,2024-10-25,0 days,"Earlier threads:
https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9dt5h/with_calls_for_new_rule_changes_after_verstappens/
https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga7lqk/by_request_i_also_compiled_all_the_f1_rules/

After compiling lists of rule changes and clarifications prompted by Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton, several users suggested I create a similar breakdown for Sebastian Vettel. However, in researching Vettel’s career, I discovered that while he was certainly involved in high-profile incidents, relatively few resulted in formal rule changes or FIA clarifications directly because of his actions.

In fact, only two racing incidents directly led to regulatory changes or clarifications. 

- - - 

**1. Team Orders and the “Multi-21” Incident**

Race: 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix

Incident: During the final stages of the race, Red Bull instructed Vettel to hold his position behind teammate Mark Webber using the ""Multi-21"" code. Ignoring the directive, Vettel overtook Webber, leading to significant tension within the team and sparking wider debates on team orders in F1.

Rule Discussion: Although the incident did not result in a formal rule change, it led the FIA to reinforce its stance that team orders were permissible within teams but that the enforcement was up to the teams themselves. This set a precedent for how team orders would be handled going forward, emphasizing FIA neutrality in intra-team directives​.


**2. Helmet Design Restrictions**

Year Introduced: 2015

Incident: Known for debuting new helmet designs almost every race during his time with Red Bull, Vettel’s constant changes created issues with driver recognition, particularly for fans and officials who sometimes found it difficult to identify him on track.

Rule Change: To enhance driver visibility and consistency, the FIA implemented a rule limiting drivers to a single primary helmet design per season, with allowances for one special event helmet. This rule was a direct response to (mostly) Vettel’s frequent design changes and aimed to maintain a consistent look for each driver throughout the season.​
​

**3. Track Re-Entry Safety**

Race: 2019 Canadian Grand Prix

Incident: Leading the race, Vettel ran off-track under pressure from Hamilton. When he rejoined, his manoeuvre forced Hamilton to slow to avoid a collision, leading to a five-second penalty that cost Vettel the race win and sparked intense debate about fair re-entry practices.

Rule Clarification: The FIA responded by clarifying its rules around track re-entry, specifying that drivers must rejoin the track safely without impeding others or forcing them to change their racing line. This clarification helped to set clearer expectations for safe re-entry in similar scenarios going forward​.
​

**4. Advocacy for Consistency in Stewarding**

Years: 2020-2021 (Various races)

Incident: Over multiple races, Vettel vocally criticized inconsistencies in stewarding, especially concerning track limits, penalty decisions, and race director judgments. His frustration highlighted the need for uniform rule enforcement and drew attention to the impact of inconsistent decision-making on race outcomes.

Rule Discussion: Although this advocacy didn’t lead to any specific rule change, it fueled discussions around fairness in penalty application and contributed to a broader movement for consistent rule enforcement. The FIA ultimately restructured its approach to race direction following the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, suggesting that Vettel’s efforts may have nudged F1 in a more consistent direction​.


**5. Concerns About the Virtual Safety Car Loophole**

(*edit: added after suggestion by /u/cafk)*

Year: 2021

Incident: Vettel voiced concerns about drivers exploiting loopholes in the VSC system, specifically how some were gaining an unfair advantage during race situations. He emphasized the need for clearer rules to maintain fair competition.

Rule clarification: Following his remarks, the FIA acknowledged these concerns and committed to reviewing and addressing the VSC system to close any loopholes, showcasing how Vettel's advocacy influenced ongoing discussions about rule enforcement in F1.

- - - 


To give a fuller picture, I’ve also included some debatable cases where Vettel’s actions sparked discussions or reinforced existing rules but I believe did not prompt specific rule changes or clarifications.

**Debatable Incidents Not Included:**

**1. Multi-Weaving in Defensive Moves**

Race: 2012 Italian Grand Prix

Incident: Vettel’s defensive move at Curva Grande pushed Fernando Alonso off-track, leading to a drive-through penalty.

Reason Not Included: The penalty reinforced the “one-move” rule in defensive driving but did not prompt a new rule or a further clarification on defensive tactics.

**2. Collision with Hamilton Behind Safety Car**

Race: 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Incident: Believing Hamilton had brake-checked him, Vettel collided with Hamilton under the safety car and pulled alongside to express his frustration, which led to a time penalty.

Reason Not Included: Although it reinforced standards of sportsmanship under caution, it did not lead to a formal rule change or clarification. The FIA upheld existing standards on conduct during the safety car without redefining them.

**3. Overtaking on Pit Lane Entry**

(*edit: added after suggestion by /u/cafk)*

Race: 2016 Chinese Grand Prix

Incident: While entering the pits, Vettel overtook ~~Daniil Kyvat~~ Jenson Button and Carlos Sainz on the pit lane entry, highlighting an ambiguous area in the rules regarding overtaking in non-race conditions like pit lane entry.
Outcome: Although Vettel’s maneuver raised questions and sparked discussion about whether overtaking should be restricted in the pit entry area, the FIA chose not to issue a clarification or rule change at the time.
