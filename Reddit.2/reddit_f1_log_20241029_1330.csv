I realize every track is different and Haas will likely not get to the points in every race for the rest off the season but their upward trend seems obvious. I do not have a deep technical understanding but a lot of people seem to view the 2025 season as an extension of 2024 when it comes to car development due to no rule changes and the maturity of the current rule set. Based on that Haas is probably in a better position for next year than they have been in at least 5 years.

Back to Ocon. On the face of it, he had a horrible season. He lost the power battle within Alpine to his arch rival, was publicly demoted to nr 2 and then announced not to be extended. It seems like he was lucky that Haas offered him a seat at all (although i personally believe he is a solid choice and deserves a seat in F1). In previous years, a change from Alpine/ Renault to Haas would have been a strong demotion, but since this year it is actually a bit of a promotion?! Haas has more than 3x the points of Alpine and the whole saga around the Alpine engine does not seem like they will calmly work to improve the car again?

Long story short: Did Ocon lose his seat to luck into a significantly better team next year? Sort of the reverse Sainz?","['Getting your hopes up for HAAS crushing it next season is a good way to get hurt.', ""Ocon was actively trying to leave Alpine. They basically announced they were not extending a driver who didn't want to extend with them in the first place. \n\nI'd say, probably, from his point of view just getting away from Alpine was a win. Haas performing better than Alpine is just a nice bonus."", 'Never completely trust Haas.', 'Not sure what to think about Ocon and Alpine. I mean alpine let him go and Monaco was probably a good excuse at that but reports were that Ocon had been shopping around even before the 2024 season started. \n\nI really would like to know what happened between Ocon and Alpine because he got a 3 year contract in 2021 and things seemingly were on the up. I think Ocon was just glad to get out of Alpine and the relationship has clearly suffered. \n\nHe even said very recently that he’s lost enjoyment for racing and is just going through the motions at this point. Alpine themselves have lost out on, in my opinion, the best midfield pairing on the grid. Gasly and Ocon are two drivers who I’d want if I was leading a team in the midfield and I’m not sure if Doohan is really a great replacement but we can only see until he’s in that car. \n\nBack to the original point, Haas are doing well and Komatsu has done a great job however we don’t know whether that will correlate to next year. They’re on a good trajectory but they also were in 2018 and then produced a car that was a tyre shredder in 2019. If Haas continue to be on a good trajectory and produce a car that starts challenging the top 4 teams then yes, Ocon is a huge winner out of all of this.', ""If Haas can keep this trajectory going then I'd say he's the winner of silly season, not just one of. It'll be the definition of failing upward.\n\nBig if though but Alpine aren't going anywhere positive either."", 'Trusting in Haas not to cock it up is quite brave', 'Three teams on the grid you must never trust even if they show form and signs of having gotten their shit together:\n\n1. Ferrari\n\n2. McLaren \n\n3. Haas', 'The midfield is forever in flux.\n\nAlpine’s said their 2025 car is completely different, and the upgrades they brought at COTA are part of their 2025 development. They’re taking home a lot of windtunnel time as well to develop their car. They’re also taking the Merc engine for 26, which is supposedly the best available for those reg’s.\n\nHaas is having a really good year this year. But we don’t know if they’ll further progress for next year, if they’ll slip back, or stay the same. They’re having less windtunnel time than they’re used to next year.\n\nCould be either of them, and then it could all change again for 26. Personally I’d bet on Alpine long term out of the two. \n\nI also think there’s security in Gasly’s position (being the only french thing left in the french national team) which should help him extend if he doesn’t get other offers. Meanwhile Ocon is more vulnerable to this being his last contract by not having those kind of ties, plus Merc who he’s tied to has passed him over once again.', 'A lot of people down playing haas. As a fan since day one I am feeling Komatsu leadership and the Toyota partnership could lead a revival to top of the mid field, and maybe a fluke podium next year.']",146,80,2024-10-29 13:30:44, Discussion,-4,-1

Even looking at the USA GP and Mex GP: multiple drivers we're penalized for forcing a driver off track or leaving the track and gaining an advantage, but at COTA all penalties were 5 sec. Now, Max got 10 sec (while I don't dissagree with the severity, it is inconsistent). Even within the Mexico GP: Max got 10 seconds for forcing Lando off track in Turn 4, being the defending car, whereas Perez got nothing for basically doing the same to Lawson as the overtaking car in the same corner.\n\nThat said, as for Max specifically: He is just smart. He simply knows how to use the rules to his advantage, even if that means making a 'smart foul'. Sportmanslike? Maybe not. But as long as it benefits him in terms of results (or it doesn't really hurt him in the worst case scenario), I think he will continu to exploit the regulations where it indeed is beneficial to him. And others at some point will follow his lead. You already saw drivers racing to the apex as they noticed Max did it effectively and gained an advantage by just racing to the apex.\n\nUnless this is more structurally adressed in a way where these 'fouls' do not result in a benefit (which can never be completely eliminated, but could be addressed more than this), I doubt things will change very much.\n\nI also think the race point ban is pretty useless. With the exception of Magnussen (who really took the piss with the regulations on some occasions), this has never been applied. Perhaps a better approach could be to penlize repeat offenders more harshly. Forcing a driver off track? 5 seconds penalty. Do it again next week? 10 seconds. Third time? Drive through. This way you leave open the possibility of people making unintential mistakes and not having to penalize them hard, but you can impose more harsh penalties to those trying to use the regulations including limited penalties to their advantage.\n\nI also still think grid penalties should be a thing. Too often we have seen a penalized driver taking advantage of their penalty (or at least not being hurt by it) due to simply having a faster car that allowed them to open enough of a gap so the penalty won't affect the race result. Examples are Lewis at Silverstone 2021 and Max at Vegas 2023. (An example the other way around is Carlos in Australia 2023, where he got a 5 second penalty but with the safety car going to the finishline, he finished the race in P4, but with the penalty applied he dropped all the way to p12 as there was simply a que of drivers right behind him due to the safety car.)"", ""Basically saying, more than half the grid has raced like this the past years.

It's all hyperbole."", '19 out of 20 drivers agree.', 'No. They won’t.

Drivers were feeling the effects of dirty air whenever they had a car within 3 seconds of then up front, that is fucking criminal. \n\nI have always said this track sucks, and I will continue to do so until it is removed.

1gesh8a,The impact of teammates on the championship - a third of Max’s lead is down to teammate impact ,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gesh8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gesh8a/the_impact_of_teammates_on_the_championship_a/,2024-10-29,0 days,"I decided to work out how much impact Perez and Piastri have had on the WDC by taking points from their teammates and their teammates’ rivals.

It was quite striking that Max has benefited a lot more from this. Perez took 7 points off Lando early in the season, thanks to the sheer dominance of the Red Bull, the extent of which we’ve not seen replicated by McLaren later in the season. 

Oscar’s impact is the more interesting one. He’s pretty much only taken points off Max when he’s also taken points from Lando. He’s actually been a detriment to Lando. This is surprising as you would expect the McLaren to be able to deliver 1-2’s. I attribute this to a few no show weekends from Oscar leading to missed opportunities (Zandvoort, Singapore and Mexico) and Lando not having the same dominance over his teammate as Max. 

I still think we could see this trend start to reverse in the run-in. When you look at the McL’s dominance over Red Bull since summer break (notwithstanding Austin weekend), then there should be potential for Oscar to slot in between Max and Lando, also noting that McL have indicated they will use team orders.

Hope you find that interesting and welcome any thoughts ","['Funnily enough Oscar has been out there to race all season, that involves beating Lando. \n\nI’m not sure what point that is trying to make.', ""Just to add to the analysis though: in the case of McLaren, the other variables. It is not enough just to have a second car that could potentially finish up and down the grid, the team has to enable that, which McLaren has been uniquely very poor at doing. I'd love to know what Oscar could have done position-wise if the team was able to execute double-stack pit stops, etc. McLaren was resolute in not coordinating strategies to benefit Lando but could have positioned both better (read: ahead of Max) with a more thoughtful approach. And of course a better start to the season would have made a difference too: if a team is intent on not having a number one driver, they cannot let that driver start the year flat footed compared to the competition. I'm of the belief that the team itself handicapped Lando's WDC effort more than any other factor, and is kind of a confounding variable in your graphs."", 'Arguably this kinda highlights the reasons why max will win the WDC and why McLaren will win the WCC (Sergio took no points off max, mostly due to spending most of his time racing haas and VCARB; McLaren on the other hand lost out on WDC points, but have (for the most part) 2 drivers instead of 1)', 'It would be interesting to add Leclerc to this.', 'Did anyone see Checo’s dad post? His caption reads “Your first Formula 1 race of Sergio Perez 2011 Grand Prix of Australia 🇦🇺 and his last race Grand Prix of Mexico 2024 🇲🇽” (there’s a lot more in the caption but I wanted to ask about this part).', 'No criticism of Oscar for being able to beat Lando on a couple of occasions. \n\nJust interesting to quantify the relative help Max has received from Perez relative to the relative hindrance Lando has received from Piastri.\n\nIf Lando had a Perez level teammate he would probably be closer to Max. \n\nI also think it’s a statistical fluke that we have never seen Lando, Oscar and Max finish in that order in a race, and that statistical fluke has held back Lando slightly', 'Sure my charts aren’t supposed to be a detailed decomposition of all the factors that influence a WDC, just a deep dive on one particular factor. I agree there’s a multitude of other factors than influence the WEC \n\nI think a lot of the weekends (Zandvoort, Singapore, Austin, Mexico) are more on Oscar than the team though', 'Yes fair summary. It does seem to imply that a rear gunner is of limited value in a championship fight. I still think there was scope (and there is scope in remaining races) for PIA to take points off VER. McL can better control the risk of him taking points off NOR with team orders', ""I'm still rooting for Ferrari to get the WCC.""]",42,33,2024-10-29 13:30:50, Statistics,7,14

# The Mexican Grand Prix



**Qualifying:**

P1. Carlos Sainz

P2. Max Verstappen

P3. Lando Norris



**Grand Prix:**

P1. Carlos Sainz

P2. Lando Norris

P3. Charles Leclerc



***LWIF1’s Reaction:***

Good lord F1 has been spicy. Unless Red Bull pulls a purple’n’blue rabbit outta their butts and manages to unlock a sizeable pace advantage over McLaren AND Ferrari *right now*, I’d wager we’re in for ever-increasing spiciness in the closing rounds. Lando’s WDC bid looks to be losing steam, at least if you consider how the amount of points he needs to gain in each race is growing rather than shrinking. Say what you will about Max’s boundary-breaking defensive tactics, but they’re proving effective—and highlighting how cunning and calculating he is… Talk about being 10/10 villain.

***Personal highlights from Mexico include:***

* The most action-packed, entertaining, dare I say *cinematic* Mexican Grand Prix in recent memory (and possibly ever?) 
* Carlos Sainz reclaiming his coveted P1 from Max with a classy overtake, then steaming off into the distance, presumably powered by chilis.  
* Contentious (and rather pissy) wheel-to-wheel action through the pack.  
* A double points finish for Haas, vaulting them into P6 in the WCC.  
* And more fuel for the driving standards fiery war of words…

\~\~\~

# The Drivers’ Mutterings & Musings

*The hottest talking point coming out of Austin and Mexico is the latest flare-up about racing standards between drivers (courtesy of Max Verstappen’s stout defensive maneuvers against Lando Norris).*

*General consensus seems that Max has been toeing the line of how the existing rules and standards are laid out—but that said existing rules and standards are part of the problem in not supporting hard and fair racing, while leaving a lot open to the interpretation of drivers and stewards alike.*

*Hence the outpouring of statements about* [*how Austin exposed the flaws in F1’s driving standards*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9cvfm/how_austin_exposed_the_flaws_in_f1s_driving/)*,* [*calls for a racing regulation overhaul*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9eo4u/jenson_button_calls_for_fia_rule_change_after/)*, and the current rules being* [*a blueprint to dissuade overtaking.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9eo4u/jenson_button_calls_for_fia_rule_change_after/)

*If you’d like to better understand these mysterious racing regulations,* [*this article courtesy of The Race is your best bet*](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/little-known-new-f1-rules-already-affecting-racing/)*, given the FIA chose not to make their 2024 regulations publicly available, unlike in years gone by.*

*Meanwhile, Mulletman Bottas has taken a simpler view,* [*claiming that some drivers are taking the piss outta the racing regulations…*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbah1i/valtteri_bottas_claims_some_drivers_taking_the_p/) *Fair enough VB!*

*Relatedly… On the heels of the above, Investigative Redditor* u/stetoe [*put together this brilliant post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9dt5h/with_calls_for_new_rule_changes_after_verstappens/) *compiling all of the F1 rule changes that have occurred since 2016 as a direct result of Max doing Max things.*

*(For those fascinated and eager for a follow up, by popular demand* u/stetoe *cobbled together similar posts as above,* [*but for rules changed due to Lewis Hamilton,*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga7lqk/by_request_i_also_compiled_all_the_f1_rules/) *as well as for* [*the changes triggered by Sebastian Vettel)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbsett/surprisingly_few_all_the_f1_rules_changed_or/)*.*

***Okay, let’s move on from the driving standards rabble-babble:***

Fernando Alonso started his 400th Grand Prix in Mexico (pretty impressive for a rookie, if I may say so), [celebrating the occasion with this lovely special lid.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8s0xp/fernando_alonso_will_start_his_400th_f1_gp_in/)

In celebration of his time-bending achievement, Young Fernando appeared on F1’s Beyond The Grid podcast to discuss [why—and how—he’s still fired up for racing in Formula 1 after 400 races](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga67mt/fernando_at_400_why_alonsos_still_fired_up/) (hint: he might be a vampire).

Thanks to his dynamite opening performances, there’s a [“carambola (which means *lucky chance* in Argentine Spanish) for Franco Colapinto to be on the grid next year.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8w9ma/virutasf1_there_is_a_carambola_for_franco/) In order for that to happen though, there’ll have to be driver movement elsewhere on the grid—as well as sponsors who will have a say.

*Aaaaand apparently* [*Franco has an offer on the table from Red Bull:*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gckaxb/sky_italia_f1_drivers_market_future_of_colapinto/) For which team and seat we know not. The hang-up, of course, is that Williams would have to release or loan Franco to a team they’ve got eyes on competing with soon… But JV did say the other week that he wants Franco on the grid, regardless if that means Williams loses points as a result. So who knows!

Pundit Lawrence Barretto claims that [“Valtteri Bottas is in good shape to retain his Sauberaudi seat, but F2 championship leader Gabriel Bortoleto is still under consideration”.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gahgbl/lawrence_barretto_i_understand_valtteri_bottas_is/) I say give me another rookie or give me death!

However, returning for another with Sauberaudi isn’t Valtteri’s only option, apparently. [Lawrence also reports that Bottas is in talks with Mercedes to return in a non-racing role as a back up](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbamaw/lawrence_barretto_valtteri_bottas_says_his/) (meaning reserve, I presume). 

And given we’re on the Americas leg of the season, the annual [“Sergio Perez is in trouble and perhaps on his last legs”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gauy46/contract_warning_for_sergio_perez_after_lawson/) rumours are bubbling up from the underworld. I’ll report on them due to his woeful trend of underperformance, but definitely, absolutely, certainly take them a spoonful of salt or two.

*However, his dearth of performance in Mexico won’t help matters.*

For another rumbling to take with a spoonful of salt (sadly), at Honda’s ~~incessant pressuring~~ behest, [Yuki Tsunoda seems to be *finally* getting a Red Bull test in Abu Dhabi this year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb956m/lawrence_barretto_yuki_tsunoda_says_theres_a_good/) Much as I’d love to see him have a season in the car, I think we all know this won’t go anywhere though :(

\~\~\~

# The Teams’ Twistings & Turnings

The War of Words between McLaren and Red Bull has been quick to return to boil, with [Lando throwing some shade at Max](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8rtba/but_the_rules_are_the_rules/) (and the FIA). In blithe response, [Max noted that McLaren have been “complaining a lot lately.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8l92a/mclaren_complain_a_lot_lately_says_verstappen_as/)

Meanwhile, Master Shit-Stirrer [Toto Wolff called Red Bull’s contentious ride height adjustment device “outrageous” and laughed at their “Bugs Bunny” tool.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8mzbk/wolff_labels_red_bull_bib_device_outrageous/) In a cantina somewhere in Mexico City, Zak Brown was seen furiously scribbling notes on “how to stir the pot without being labeled a Karen…”

\~\~\~

# Technical Tidbits

In a move that all fans are sure to hate if this results in what I expect it will, [Duracell has become F1’s first DRS Zone sponsor in Las Vegas.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8sz6d/duracell_becomes_f1s_first_drs_zone_sponsor_in/) I can hear the calls now… *“Max Verstappen enters the Duracell DRS Zone, which will surely help him stay ahead of Lando Norris for at least one more lap.”* If this pans out like Tissot’s sprint race sponsorship in MotoGP, you *will* hear “Duracell” every time the camera feed moves through this section of track.

If you, like everyone at Mercedes I presume, are tired of the ride height shenanigans of this current generation of cars, [you’ll be thrilled to know that F1’s 2026 regulations will leave behind the current ride height nightmares.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga76b3/why_f1s_2026_rules_will_shake_off_rideheight/)

\~\~\~

# Paddock Playtime

I’m not sure how this video was allowed to escape the Red Bull garage, [so get a load of what a current F1 car looks like under the skin while you still can.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb68a0/formula_aerodynamics_so_much_technology_fudo2/)

Williams and their new partner Mercado Libre (courtesy of Young Gun Franco Colapito) put together [this fun little commercial](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb2gp5/mercado_libre_commercial_revealing_the_new/) revealing their special livery for Mexico and Brazil. [Gallery pics of the car can be found here if you wish.](https://www.williamsf1.com/posts/1b734b55-9192-45df-9211-a3dc22479449/williams-racing-mercado-libre-heritage-inspired-yellow-engine-cover)

If you happen to have a cool few million to burn on non-essentials, [you can get your paws on Michael Schumacher’s 2006 Ferrarimobile.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1galaue/michael_schumachers_2006_ferrari_formula_1_car_is/)

Perhaps the world’s most famous bulldog, [Roscoe, son of Lewis, turns 12!](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbcj2s/lewishamilton_everyone_wish_my_son/)

Who knew [Charles Leclerc would look so natural and at home in a mariachi outfit?!](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb71zy/charles_leclerc_arriving_at_the_paddock_dressed/) I suppose that’s that pretty privilege coming to the fore…

Should you have the niche curiosity of wondering what driving the F1 Safety Car is like, long-time [SC Pilot Bernd Maylander spilled the beans on his (pretty neat) job in this interview with Formula 1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gclkgk/maylander_on_what_its_like_to_drive_the_aston/)

We probably all know that if soembody gets a drive-through or stop&go penalty in the last 3 laps or post-race, then it's converted to 20 or 30 seconds.

I'd love to hear some people's suggestions on how a better rule could be written. It might also be useful to the discussion for others to poke holes in suggested rules, to see how they could be gamed. Maybe ultimately we can come up with something better...

IMO rules should be very simple to understand in the heat of battle, but also very clear cut to enable easy decision making by the stewards.","['Send it. Let the gods decide.', '""Just do it""', 'Maybe stay on the track.\nLegal defending must remain within track limits or lose position', "">How would you write a better overtaking rule?\n\nI wouldn't.\n\nThe problem is that as soon as you codify what overtaking is in the rules, you'll get teams challenging everything that falls outside that definition. And there's often going to be scenarios that arise where you cannot address them.\n\nTake, for instance, the incident between Verstappen and Norris at Turn 4 in Mexico. Norris was slightly ahead of Verstappen going into the corner. Does that mean that he had completed an overtake? No -- as we have seen on countless occasions, you need to be a good way ahead of another driver to overtake around the outside there. But if Norris had been on the inside of the corner, he would need to be much less further ahead of Verstappen to make that pass work. So straight away we have a corner where the criteria for judging the success of an overtake is different depending on the position of the cars on the track. You can't write a rule to address that, because then you'd have to write a rule to address every position going into every corner on every circuit. And that's before we even consider the presence of Sainz in the Turn 4 incident -- he was going through a slow apex when Verstappen and Norris arrived. Verstappen's choices were a) brake hard, b) hit Sainz, or c) take a more shallow line to avoid contact. He chose the third option, which on balance was probably the best option since braking hard risked a lock-up and hitting Sainz was never an option.\n\nThe vast majority of responses to the proposal of writing rules around overtaking seem to have one thing in mind: creating a scenario were Norris can get ever-so-slightly ahead of Verstappen, and thus requiring Verstappen to immediately concede the position."", 'Just leave it the way it is with one amendment.  Any car that has established their position with their front tires at minimum in front of the rear tires of the opposing car, either on the inside or the outside of another car, prior to the breaking zone, is entitled to enough space to remain on the racetrack alongside the opposing car throughout the corner or until the leading cars rearmost point is in front of the trailing cars forward most point.', 'Both cars stay within track limits. \n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.', 'Really simple.\n\nIf aproaching the corner there is overlap of at least front wheel to rear wheel then both cars must be left at least a cars width to the edge of the track on both inside and outside.\n\nSimples', 'I’d scrap the rules except some basic guidelines (not shoving other drivers off track and idk what else) and deal with the real issue which is inconsistent stewarding', 'I think all the rule needs is to forget ""ahead at the apex"" and focus on ""ahead in the braking zone"".

1geekse,What was happening with Charles on Sunday? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1geekse/what_was_happening_with_charles_on_sunday/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1geekse/what_was_happening_with_charles_on_sunday/,2024-10-28,0 days,"This is a genuine question because I wasn’t able to watch the race and instead caught glimpses in live timings

The main thing i seen about the race was discourse over regulations and then flashes of discourse from the Ferrari  side.

I kind of assumed it was a bit of dramatics from Charles fans (I am also a Charles fan but sometimes things are blown out of proportion), like claiming Ferrari used team orders to stop Charles overtaking in Australia when Charles was never in the position to.

But I finally decided to go back and see what happened and I am so confused about what happened in the first stint.

I don’t think I have enough technical f1 knowledge to know what Ferrari were trying to do. I seen a comment from Fred after seeming to talk about future engine saving?

How urgent was this because continuing to tell Charles to slow his pace and letting him build such a gap is so risky, unless it was needed to finish the race strong.

Especially when they know Lando’s behind and something that’s been true all season but was especially evident with Mclarens updates the previous race, is Mclaren is a different beast on hards.

In COTA, Mclaren went from not even being close to a threat to having more pace than Ferrari on the hards. Ferrari never had to worry about it cause he was stuck behind Max but if he wasn’t then he would’ve been a threat to at least Carlos.

I think COTA made people almost underestimate the pace of the Mclaren because of the dirty air medium stint, but go back and look at Lando on hards, in dirty air. He had very minimal tire age advantage as well.

So going into the second stint, with no Max in between, that is a very dangerous position to be in.

The second stint seems pretty simple. Good pace, get stuck in dirty air behind cars, have Lando catch up and the push very, very hard to try and stay ahead which hurt his tires, especially cause the majority of his pushing was when overtaking lapped cars.

That was the right plan of action for that stint because Mercedes were too far back to be a threat, and so it’s let Lando past and nurse tires or push hard and burn tires but maybe be able to hold Lando back.

But Charles should’ve been able to have a big enough gap from the medium stint to be able to have a solid pace and manage his tires without having to base it on Lando.

You can never bet against Mclaren (specifically Lando) not having the pace advantage on hards on low fuel. Lando has never not been the fastest in those conditions since Imola, unless something he’s stuck behind someone or other extenuating circumstances.

So what i’m wondering is what was the issue? Was it a we need to do this for the sake of the race and the car or we should do this because it’ll help us later and Charles is in a pretty safe position.

Having two drivers running p1 and p2 when they have similar pace and are close together, especially if the one behind has slightly better pace but nothing to switch positions over is a very difficult situation to handle, so was it Ferrari choosing an advantageous time so the drivers wouldn’t fight each other? 

I’m genuinely asking out of confusion because i feel like i’ve missed so many details and i don’t understand what the radio messages were really meaning.","[""It's likely that the brakes were actually heating up too much, given the thin air in Mexico - this was massively exacerbated by running behind Sainz for a short while, especially the 3 or 4 laps where he was within 1.5 seconds.\n\nI will put a little tweak to your points though. Sainz was faster in Mexico, but in Australia the team did radio to Charles to stop him from fighting Sainz. This was because they didn't think they'd be able to challenge for the win again this season - how wrong they were!"", '>You can never bet against Mclaren (specifically Lando) not having the pace advantage on hards on low fuel. Lando has never not been the fastest in those conditions since Imola, unless something he’s stuck behind someone or other extenuating circumstances.\n\nAt the end, it was pretty much this. And then he had the incredible save onto the frontstretch, and that sealed it.', 'There was no issue per se. He had to use LiCo to cool the car and had some holdup from a few backmarkers which closed the gap to Lando.\n\nI’ve seen more than a few fans of a certain fanbase suggest nefarious conspiracies and it really shows how unhinged fans can be.', 'I did not compare his onboard with Carlos. But his brake was nearly overheated all the time, which was caused by dirty air probably. And he was seldom great in Mexico, which may also relate to the LiCo issue.', 'Leclerc was asked to do lico and so was Sainz. However when Leclerc hit the back marker traffic he was told ‘no more lico’ so I assume he was saving his engine for needing to overtake backmarkers. The backmarkers not letting him through quickly enough didn’t help. The McLaren comes alive in the second stint and Norris (who has been saving his tyres for this part of his race) starts eating up the advantage Leclerc built over him throughout the race. Leclerc couldn’t do anything about that as his tyres had gone. Norris was already faster and getting quicker. It was a case of when Norris would pass him not if. He just made it easier by going off the track. \n\nI know that Ferrari radioed Charles to tell him not to fight Sainz, but in their defence it was the right decision. Sainz was faster and they would have lost time fighting knowing that Norris would be coming back at them in the second stint. It worked for Ferrari. I wouldn’t have minded them fighting, it would have been Norris’ win if that happened.', ""I mean even if there was a serious issue with the PU or overheating with the breaks, i doubt they would say it on the radio outright. plus if these were indirect team orders charles' expression after the race would let you know. he is not good at hiding his displeasure lol.\n\nmy conspiracy theory is ollie's crash in fp1 and the rebuild after that did more damage than expected."", 'Backmarkers fucked him. In short.', '""Nothing"", *walks away*', 'Backmarkers closed the gap, Lando had drs from backmarkers im the main straight 2 times.

In 2023 Piastri was fairly close in qualifying but his tyre management in races was missing (which is not a surprise for a rookie). In 2024 Oscar has not quite closed the gap in qualies but his racecraft has been impressive several times.

I believe the general consensus amongst F1 fans in general is that Norris has more pace while Piastri has a better composure. What do you think is more important then ? Is it speed or mentality ? Also who is more likely to turn things around... is it Lando improving his mentality and his starts or is it Oscar becoming quicker (especially over one lap) ?","['Ask me after the next season, if Piastri is still not matching Norris by the end of that then Norris is better with the higher ceiling.', 'Piastri is 1cm taller, so all ceilings will be relatively lower.', ""I have no way to evaluate who has a higher ceiling and I won't pretend to. But what I do find funny and weird is any claim that Piastri will be better because he keeps his composure better and is calmer. Since when is that something necessary for a driver?

People point to this being Oscar’s second season but he’s had 42 races now. In comparison, Lando’s 42nd race was midway through the 2021 season where he was 3rd (yes THIRD) in the drivers championship and ahead of both Perez and Bottas in the clear 3rd/4th best car. He had a run of like 8 top 5 finishes in a row in that car.\n\nI don’t think Oscar has shown that he has the one lap pace of Lando and thats usually something that comes pretty quick, for example we saw Lando outqualify Sainz in his first 2 seasons, and Leclerc outqualify Vettel in his 2nd season. In comparison Oscar is losing 16-4 H2H so far this season.\n\nOscar is still improving but people still don’t like to admit how good Lando is (who is still improving himself), which sometimes makes Oscar look worse than he is.

Be lucky to get one frankly guys."", 'I find it insane how people often talk about how ""Oscar has improved rapidly"" when he has basically the same average pace gap to Lando now as he did in like the last 1/3rd of 2023', 'What I’m noticing in this thread is how people tend to gloss over Lando’s race pace and tyre management. Everyone acknowledges his qualifying pace and how quick he is over one lap but he gets much less recognition for how he’s able to zoom off into the distance as soon as he gets into clean air and gets more out of his tyres than basically anyone else. His race pace and tyre management is some of the best on the grid. Oscar is quite a bit off matching him in those areas too.']",0,145,2024-10-29 13:30:56, Discussion,0,0

Here is how I see it, I'm open to have my views refuted on this.

  
1. They are arriving in the corner pretty much side-by-side, Lando being slightly ahead, he squeezes Max to the apex.

[https://i.imgur.com/e7nVQmg.png](https://i.imgur.com/e7nVQmg.png)

  
2. They are still side-by-side, Verstappen is almost in the back of the Ferrari, gets squeezed even tighter to the apex, Max starts slightly going wider to avoid driving to the back of the Ferrari.

 [https://i.imgur.com/h3MRdv2.png](https://i.imgur.com/h3MRdv2.png)

  
3. You see Max going wider, otherwise he would've crashed into the back of the Ferrari, you could argue that he went wider to take evasive action into crashing into the Ferrari.

  
[https://i.imgur.com/6OaHFW7.png](https://i.imgur.com/6OaHFW7.png)

  
4. Max stays in the white lines, Lando goes slightly off, is barely outside of the white lines.

[https://i.imgur.com/HoIUhWX.png](https://i.imgur.com/HoIUhWX.png)

  
5. Lando just ignores the track lines completely and takes a sharp right turn.

  
[https://i.imgur.com/bIZhH0g.png](https://i.imgur.com/bIZhH0g.png)

  
6. You can see Lando take even sharper turn to the right to completely cut off the corner to end up ahead of Sainz and Verstappen, but Sainz has the speed advantage and overtakes Norris once again.

I'm not trying to defend anyone here, I just want to understand the penalty better.","[""It's simple. Lando was alongside Max at the apex (less than half a car length alongside). Therefore, according to rules, he's entitled space. Max didn't give it to him and pushed him off. So, by the letter of the rule, Max had to be penalized.\n\nThe Ferrari being there didn't allow Max to divebomb the apex just to be ahead by half a car length at the apex like he did at COTA. After that, if the Ferrari doesn't allow Max to go as fast as he wants, tough luck. It's racing.\n\nThis being said, the being half a car length ahead at the apex rule is total BS. If a car is alongside, that driver deserves space"", ""The key is that, with the way the guidelines are currently, as long as Lando is level with or ahead of Max on the outside, it's Max's responsibility to give him enough room to be able to complete the corner on track.\n\nIn that position, regardless of the Ferrari, Max can't force Lando off the track without getting a penalty.\n\nYou also missed the final step, when Lando gave the position straight back to Sainz ~~and Verstappen~~ because he cut the corner."", 'Kind of interesting, if you\'re really unbiased you see this incident in a very different way to myself.\n\nI went back and watched the helicopter cam multiple times and watched the Onboards from Norris and Verstappen because I didn\'t get where you are coming from. And I still don\'t get it.\n\nThere is no ""sqeezing to the apex"". There is always a car\'s width of space on the inside of Norris. If you watch them on the straight before turn 4, it\'s just normal racing. Verstappen stays on the inside to defend. As soon as Norris commits to the outside, Verstappen drifts wide to the middle of the track to get a good entry into turn 4.\n\nMax doesn\'t take any evasive action to avoid the Ferrari. It\'s true to say he has to take the corner normal and can\'t overshoot the apex because Sainz is there. \n\nIn Verstappens Onboard you can see that he judged his approach to the corner perfectly, he doesn\'t even need to wait before getting on the throttle again.\n\nHe simply doesn\'t leave any space on the outside, which he has to do as Norris was in front at the apex. He has to step on the brakes hard for turn 5 to avoid crashing into Sainz, because of his exit out of turn 4.\n\nNorris then just cuts the corner completely because everything else would cost him more than 5 seconds.\n\nYou asked in a comment what Verstappen could have done differenty. He could have left a car\'s width space on the outside. But then he would have lost the position of course because the next turn is a sharp right.\n\nI also tried to judge if Norris would even have made the corner if he would have been given space. But I\'m not sure about that. Maybe, maybe not. We\'ll never know. And from what we learned last week in COTA it doesn\'t even matter because it\'s only important that you\'re ahead at the apex. That\'s the real BS in all of this.', 'Very biased interpretion of events for someone ""impartial""\n\n""Max stays in the white lines, Lando goes slightly off, is barely outside of the white lines"" \n\nHe didn\'t just ""go slightly off"" himself, he stayed on track the entire time until Max literally hit him with his car (yes, their front tires touched). Pretty hard to stay on track when someone really doesn\'t want you there.', '""I\'m impartial""    \nProceeds to only phrase things in the most positive way possible to favor Max. ;)  \n\nYou have to keep one thing in mind - Max could have gone at a normal speed into the turn and braked earlier/harder at any point, but he didn\'t - he kept more speed into the turn, that\'s why he was so close to the Ferrari. He\'s not taking evasive actions, he\'s running wide on purpose. Why ? Because he knows Lando is on his outside, and he wants to run him out of road just like he did last week. Except this time, Lando was ahead at the apex, so while he didn\'t get penalised for it last week, this time around he\'s supposed to give him the space, and he didn\'t - on purpose, again, it\'s not like he doesn\'t know how much speed he can carry, or how much angle he can or can\'t give his steering wheel.', '“Max goes wide not to crash into the Ferrari” Really? It’s called a brake pedal.\n\n“Lando goes slightly off”. There is no such thing ad slightly off. Either off or on.\n\n“Lando ignores track lines completely”. If Lando had tried to follow the track he would have had to make an even sharper right, which means slowing down more. Pressing the brake on the grass is a major no-no. Could have crashes in either car in front or both. He gave the place back in the end.', '>They are arriving in the corner pretty much side-by-side, **Lando being slightly ahead**\n\nYou answered your own question.\n\nRead the official decision here: [https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Mexico%20City%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Infringement%20-%20Car%201%20-%20Turn%204%20Forcing%20another%20driver%20of%20the%20track%20(corrected).pdf](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Mexico%20City%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Infringement%20-%20Car%201%20-%20Turn%204%20Forcing%20another%20driver%20of%20the%20track%20(corrected).pdf)', ""I'm no expert in the rules and I don't even have a strong opinion either way, but I'll try to make the case for the penalty:\n\n1. Lando is slightly ahead going into the corner, which (as per the current rules) entitles him to space through the corner\n2. Lando is leaving enough space for Max on the inside (pretty much the normal reacing line, as can be seen by Max basically following Carlos' line into the corner exactly)\n3. Max is boxed in between Carlos in front and Lando on his right. This is a shitty situation for Max but not really uncommon, especially at the start of races. In this case you sometimes just have to brake harder and concede if you don't want to crash into the car in front. Max could have covered the outside on the straight before and Lando would probably go to the inside and be in the same position that Max found himself in.\n4. Max tries to avoid braking by opening the steering and taking a wider line through the corner. If he wants to do that, he still has to make sure Lando has space through the corner. \n5. Obviously I don't know but the track is quite wide and I find it hard to believe that Max wasn't able to take a tighter line, even after opening the steering, that leaves Lando enough space to stay on track. He doesn't do that.\n6. To me, it looks like he doesn't try very hard to tighten his line but is happy with drifting wide because he knows that will make Lando either crash into him or go off track. \n7. Therefore you could argue he pushed Lando off the track even though Lando was (as per the current rules) entitled to space. Thats why the penalty is deserved."", 'Pretty simple. Drivers are side by side so both drivers need to leave space. Lando left space for max on the inside, max did not leave space for Lando on the outside.']",0,59,2024-10-29 13:30:57, Discussion,0,2
