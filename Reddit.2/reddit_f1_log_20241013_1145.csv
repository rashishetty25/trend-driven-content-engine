It\'s part of the game, but I usually just let it go.""\n\n> ""I\'ve been in F1 for 10 years now and I\'m not wasting time on all those stories. I barely read anything about F1 anyway.\n\n> Sometimes I see something or someone else tells me: \'Did you see what this and that person said?\' But I always say people can think what they want, I\'m not going to waste my energy on that. So, I don\'t really care about what other people say.""\n\n*On the comments from Rival teams over its form dip and its off-track power struggles, which prompted McLaren CEO Zak Brown to say that Red Bull had been ""destabilised"". He later described the team as a ""pretty toxic"" environment :*\n\n> ""People that say all sorts of stuff should just focus on their own team,"" Verstappen replied when the subject was brought up. ""That\'s nothing specifically against Zak Brown, by the way, it applies to everyone. People just need to focus on themselves, and that\'s what I\'m doing as well.""\n\n*On the Red Bull - McLaren rivalry which has now also ignited on track, with McLaren overtaking Red Bull in the constructors\' championship and Lando Norris challenging Verstappen for the drivers\' title, including a collision between the pair in Austria :*\n\n> ""Yes, because right now we still have four teams at the front, while back then you just had the same two people up front,"" he explained. ""Of course, 2021 was my first world championship, so that was very different already. I think I\'m a bit more relaxed about it now.\n\n> ""Of course, I want to win and of course, I\'m going to do my best to defend that [52-point] lead. But the feeling is very different from 2021.""', ""Solid response, really. And given some of the speculation is stirred from rival parties, it is nothing that everybody hasn't seen before\n\nIf I were in his shoes, I think I will be pretty amused myself if I heard those speculations, while also knowing what goes on internally. Good that he is not indulging in it, if his words are anything to go by\n\nFor the fans, it's nothing but speculation, given people are not privy to the technical information available, so alternate suggestions to their dip in performance will fly. People talk, but I hope they know that it is what it is, at the end of day. Speculation""]",6,3,2024-10-13 11:45:00,News
