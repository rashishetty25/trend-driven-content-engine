This is de Zordo's first year, behind a new Principal, and he has delivered the goods with the upgrades Haas has received all year.  Komatsu is doing a great job as principal, but I wanted to shoutout de Zordo too because Komatsu can keep the team organized and all pulling in the same direction, and that's great, but without competent technical direction it's hard to imagine a team going from P10 to P6 with as few resources to work with as Haas has.

With Simone Resta, the relatively well-regarded technical chief from previous years, moving on to greener pastures at Mercedes this year, it would be easy to imagine Haas technical direction taking a step backwards this year.   De Zordo has filled that gap nicely, delivering a very clean set of upgrades that has consistently permitted his team to perform well ahead of the team's median expectations, with nearly every upgrade added to the car resulting in at least a few more points for the team as a whole.  For a team fighting from the back into the midfield, that's an impressive accomplishment.

For the team with the fewest developmental resources in Formula 1, Haas has performed way above their own heads at key times this year, and while Komatsu deserves a large share of the laurels for that, and some credit is due to the drivers as well, de Zordo and his team should not be forgotten.","['Haas and Ferrari did a great job fixing their tire wear issue over the winter.', 'Really makes you wonder how hard Steiner was holding the team back.', 'Nice to meet you Andrea x', 'Shoutout Ferrari', 'Is this a self-advertisement?', 'Remember when in testing people were saying Haas should be kicked out because they were 5 seconds off the pace?

I realize every track is different and Haas will likely not get to the points in every race for the rest off the season but their upward trend seems obvious. I do not have a deep technical understanding but a lot of people seem to view the 2025 season as an extension of 2024 when it comes to car development due to no rule changes and the maturity of the current rule set. Based on that Haas is probably in a better position for next year than they have been in at least 5 years.

Back to Ocon. On the face of it, he had a horrible season. He lost the power battle within Alpine to his arch rival, was publicly demoted to nr 2 and then announced not to be extended. It seems like he was lucky that Haas offered him a seat at all (although i personally believe he is a solid choice and deserves a seat in F1). In previous years, a change from Alpine/ Renault to Haas would have been a strong demotion, but since this year it is actually a bit of a promotion?! Haas has more than 3x the points of Alpine and the whole saga around the Alpine engine does not seem like they will calmly work to improve the car again?

Long story short: Did Ocon lose his seat to luck into a significantly better team next year? Sort of the reverse Sainz?","['Getting your hopes up for HAAS crushing it next season is a good way to get hurt.', ""Ocon was actively trying to leave Alpine. They basically announced they were not extending a driver who didn't want to extend with them in the first place. \n\nI'd say, probably, from his point of view just getting away from Alpine was a win.

I mean alpine let him go and Monaco was probably a good excuse at that but reports were that Ocon had been shopping around even before the 2024 season started. \n\nI really would like to know what happened between Ocon and Alpine because he got a 3 year contract in 2021 and things seemingly were on the up. I think Ocon was just glad to get out of Alpine and the relationship has clearly suffered. \n\nHe even said very recently that he’s lost enjoyment for racing and is just going through the motions at this point. Alpine themselves have lost out on, in my opinion, the best midfield pairing on the grid. Gasly and Ocon are two drivers who I’d want if I was leading a team in the midfield and I’m not sure if Doohan is really a great replacement but we can only see until he’s in that car. \n\nBack to the original point, Haas are doing well and Komatsu has done a great job however we don’t know whether that will correlate to next year. They’re on a good trajectory but they also were in 2018 and then produced a car that was a tyre shredder in 2019.

Plus Ferrari would've known this and reacted with their tire strats or use Charles to undercut and mess with Lando. Could he have won? Yes. Would it be a sure thing? Absolutely not. Sainz is no slouch and this track isn't Cota when it comes to over taking. Max just made Ferrari life a whole lot easier."", 'It\'s what we said at the time as well, the worst thing for Norris\'s race was that he got stuck behind Max due to egregious divebomb by Max into T7, which not only lost him the position to Max but also let Charles through.\n\nThen Max just kept gradually falling more and more behind the Ferraris, and Lando was stuck there in the dirty air being unable to make a move (also due to inherent lack of straight line performance for Mclaren, Piastri was having trouble passing cars down the straight for a lot of the race as well).\n\nBy the time Max pitted, Lando was already almost 13 seconds off the lead, and that difference just increased over the next couple laps as well because his tyres were already dead being stuck behind Max for first 25 laps.\n\nIn fact in the second stint, Lando reduced the gap to Carlos all the way to 4.7 seconds by the end, and even hunted down and passed Charles on track. \n\nIf Lando is 2nd after Lap 10, and doesn\'t have Leclerc between him in Sainz for the rest of the race, I think it\'s quite possible he wins the race given his immense advantage during the hard stint.

Jokes aside, how do these meetings pan out? What kind of plans do they discuss? Maybe I'm wrong but it must be depressing to discuss different plans when the whole camp must know they will come in pretty much last place.

This is what Sainz said about that kind of situation at the Japanese post-race press conference early this year. For context, if you need it: last year people were saying Ferrari strategy was terrible but this year they improved a lot. \n\n>   **Autosport:** Ferrari seem pretty strategically sharp in this race - it's been something the team's been criticized for a lot in the past - I just wondered could you to expand on any particular work you've seen the team doing and how pleased you feel about that?\n\n>   **Sainz:** I think we made some progress on strategy over the last three years progressively but if you see a jump this year on strategy it's purely down to the car. I think just having a car that allows you to have flexibility on strategy is something that last year we couldn't have, so we were boxed in to stop at certain laps, we couldn't extend, we had so much deg that it looked always like people could extend and then come back on us on a harder tire. Last year we were just zero flexible and we couldn't do anything with our racing so it looked like we were not getting the strategy right a lot of times. But when you have a car that is better on tyres, two drivers that can push on the car more often, and you have that extra flexibility, your strategy also looks better.

# The Mexican Grand Prix



**Qualifying:**

P1. Carlos Sainz

P2. Max Verstappen

P3. Lando Norris



**Grand Prix:**

P1. Carlos Sainz

P2. Lando Norris

P3. Charles Leclerc



***LWIF1’s Reaction:***

Good lord F1 has been spicy. Unless Red Bull pulls a purple’n’blue rabbit outta their butts and manages to unlock a sizeable pace advantage over McLaren AND Ferrari *right now*, I’d wager we’re in for ever-increasing spiciness in the closing rounds. Lando’s WDC bid looks to be losing steam, at least if you consider how the amount of points he needs to gain in each race is growing rather than shrinking. Say what you will about Max’s boundary-breaking defensive tactics, but they’re proving effective—and highlighting how cunning and calculating he is… Talk about being 10/10 villain.

***Personal highlights from Mexico include:***

* The most action-packed, entertaining, dare I say *cinematic* Mexican Grand Prix in recent memory (and possibly ever?) 
* Carlos Sainz reclaiming his coveted P1 from Max with a classy overtake, then steaming off into the distance, presumably powered by chilis.  
* Contentious (and rather pissy) wheel-to-wheel action through the pack.  
* A double points finish for Haas, vaulting them into P6 in the WCC.  
* And more fuel for the driving standards fiery war of words…

\~\~\~

# The Drivers’ Mutterings & Musings

*The hottest talking point coming out of Austin and Mexico is the latest flare-up about racing standards between drivers (courtesy of Max Verstappen’s stout defensive maneuvers against Lando Norris).*

*General consensus seems that Max has been toeing the line of how the existing rules and standards are laid out—but that said existing rules and standards are part of the problem in not supporting hard and fair racing, while leaving a lot open to the interpretation of drivers and stewards alike.*

*Hence the outpouring of statements about* [*how Austin exposed the flaws in F1’s driving standards*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9cvfm/how_austin_exposed_the_flaws_in_f1s_driving/)*,* [*calls for a racing regulation overhaul*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9eo4u/jenson_button_calls_for_fia_rule_change_after/)*, and the current rules being* [*a blueprint to dissuade overtaking.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9eo4u/jenson_button_calls_for_fia_rule_change_after/)

*If you’d like to better understand these mysterious racing regulations,* [*this article courtesy of The Race is your best bet*](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/little-known-new-f1-rules-already-affecting-racing/)*, given the FIA chose not to make their 2024 regulations publicly available, unlike in years gone by.*

*Meanwhile, Mulletman Bottas has taken a simpler view,* [*claiming that some drivers are taking the piss outta the racing regulations…*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbah1i/valtteri_bottas_claims_some_drivers_taking_the_p/) *Fair enough VB!*

*Relatedly… On the heels of the above, Investigative Redditor* u/stetoe [*put together this brilliant post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9dt5h/with_calls_for_new_rule_changes_after_verstappens/) *compiling all of the F1 rule changes that have occurred since 2016 as a direct result of Max doing Max things.*

*(For those fascinated and eager for a follow up, by popular demand* u/stetoe *cobbled together similar posts as above,* [*but for rules changed due to Lewis Hamilton,*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga7lqk/by_request_i_also_compiled_all_the_f1_rules/) *as well as for* [*the changes triggered by Sebastian Vettel)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbsett/surprisingly_few_all_the_f1_rules_changed_or/)*.*

***Okay, let’s move on from the driving standards rabble-babble:***

Fernando Alonso started his 400th Grand Prix in Mexico (pretty impressive for a rookie, if I may say so), [celebrating the occasion with this lovely special lid.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8s0xp/fernando_alonso_will_start_his_400th_f1_gp_in/)

In celebration of his time-bending achievement, Young Fernando appeared on F1’s Beyond The Grid podcast to discuss [why—and how—he’s still fired up for racing in Formula 1 after 400 races](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga67mt/fernando_at_400_why_alonsos_still_fired_up/) (hint: he might be a vampire).

Thanks to his dynamite opening performances, there’s a [“carambola (which means *lucky chance* in Argentine Spanish) for Franco Colapinto to be on the grid next year.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8w9ma/virutasf1_there_is_a_carambola_for_franco/) In order for that to happen though, there’ll have to be driver movement elsewhere on the grid—as well as sponsors who will have a say.

*Aaaaand apparently* [*Franco has an offer on the table from Red Bull:*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gckaxb/sky_italia_f1_drivers_market_future_of_colapinto/) For which team and seat we know not. The hang-up, of course, is that Williams would have to release or loan Franco to a team they’ve got eyes on competing with soon… But JV did say the other week that he wants Franco on the grid, regardless if that means Williams loses points as a result. So who knows!

Pundit Lawrence Barretto claims that [“Valtteri Bottas is in good shape to retain his Sauberaudi seat, but F2 championship leader Gabriel Bortoleto is still under consideration”.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gahgbl/lawrence_barretto_i_understand_valtteri_bottas_is/) I say give me another rookie or give me death!

However, returning for another with Sauberaudi isn’t Valtteri’s only option, apparently. [Lawrence also reports that Bottas is in talks with Mercedes to return in a non-racing role as a back up](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbamaw/lawrence_barretto_valtteri_bottas_says_his/) (meaning reserve, I presume). 

And given we’re on the Americas leg of the season, the annual [“Sergio Perez is in trouble and perhaps on his last legs”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gauy46/contract_warning_for_sergio_perez_after_lawson/) rumours are bubbling up from the underworld. I’ll report on them due to his woeful trend of underperformance, but definitely, absolutely, certainly take them a spoonful of salt or two.

*However, his dearth of performance in Mexico won’t help matters.*

For another rumbling to take with a spoonful of salt (sadly), at Honda’s ~~incessant pressuring~~ behest, [Yuki Tsunoda seems to be *finally* getting a Red Bull test in Abu Dhabi this year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb956m/lawrence_barretto_yuki_tsunoda_says_theres_a_good/) Much as I’d love to see him have a season in the car, I think we all know this won’t go anywhere though :(

\~\~\~

# The Teams’ Twistings & Turnings

The War of Words between McLaren and Red Bull has been quick to return to boil, with [Lando throwing some shade at Max](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8rtba/but_the_rules_are_the_rules/) (and the FIA). In blithe response, [Max noted that McLaren have been “complaining a lot lately.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8l92a/mclaren_complain_a_lot_lately_says_verstappen_as/)

Meanwhile, Master Shit-Stirrer [Toto Wolff called Red Bull’s contentious ride height adjustment device “outrageous” and laughed at their “Bugs Bunny” tool.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8mzbk/wolff_labels_red_bull_bib_device_outrageous/) In a cantina somewhere in Mexico City, Zak Brown was seen furiously scribbling notes on “how to stir the pot without being labeled a Karen…”

\~\~\~

# Technical Tidbits

In a move that all fans are sure to hate if this results in what I expect it will, [Duracell has become F1’s first DRS Zone sponsor in Las Vegas.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8sz6d/duracell_becomes_f1s_first_drs_zone_sponsor_in/) I can hear the calls now… *“Max Verstappen enters the Duracell DRS Zone, which will surely help him stay ahead of Lando Norris for at least one more lap.”* If this pans out like Tissot’s sprint race sponsorship in MotoGP, you *will* hear “Duracell” every time the camera feed moves through this section of track.

If you, like everyone at Mercedes I presume, are tired of the ride height shenanigans of this current generation of cars, [you’ll be thrilled to know that F1’s 2026 regulations will leave behind the current ride height nightmares.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga76b3/why_f1s_2026_rules_will_shake_off_rideheight/)

\~\~\~

# Paddock Playtime

I’m not sure how this video was allowed to escape the Red Bull garage, [so get a load of what a current F1 car looks like under the skin while you still can.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb68a0/formula_aerodynamics_so_much_technology_fudo2/)

Williams and their new partner Mercado Libre (courtesy of Young Gun Franco Colapito) put together [this fun little commercial](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb2gp5/mercado_libre_commercial_revealing_the_new/) revealing their special livery for Mexico and Brazil. [Gallery pics of the car can be found here if you wish.](https://www.williamsf1.com/posts/1b734b55-9192-45df-9211-a3dc22479449/williams-racing-mercado-libre-heritage-inspired-yellow-engine-cover)

If you happen to have a cool few million to burn on non-essentials, [you can get your paws on Michael Schumacher’s 2006 Ferrarimobile.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1galaue/michael_schumachers_2006_ferrari_formula_1_car_is/)

Perhaps the world’s most famous bulldog, [Roscoe, son of Lewis, turns 12!](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbcj2s/lewishamilton_everyone_wish_my_son/)

Who knew [Charles Leclerc would look so natural and at home in a mariachi outfit?!](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb71zy/charles_leclerc_arriving_at_the_paddock_dressed/) I suppose that’s that pretty privilege coming to the fore…

Should you have the niche curiosity of wondering what driving the F1 Safety Car is like, long-time [SC Pilot Bernd Maylander spilled the beans on his (pretty neat) job in this interview with Formula 1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gclkgk/maylander_on_what_its_like_to_drive_the_aston/)

In fact, F1 indicated that the situation might look different in the future if Cadillac were involved.

Yes, Cadillac do have the V-Series.R in IMSA and the World Endurance Championship, but that car is built by Dallara and is run by Chip Ganassi Racing under the Cadillac Racing banner. Cadillac bankroll the project and the car carries their name, but they don't have the day-to-day oversight of the team or the experience to do it. So in the case of Formula 1, Andretti would build the chassis and run the trackside operations while Dallara would build and provide the engines. Exactly how this would have been branded remains to be seen. As for why they would do it this way, there are two obvious advantages: first, they can pitch it as an American team using an American engine, which they couldn't do if they were just supplying an engine to another team. Secondly, they would have more direct control over how the team is run. Andretti might be overseeing the day-to-day stuff, but Cadillac would have a seat at the table for the big decisions that they wouldn't get elsewhere without buying a team out.""]",11,30,2024-10-29 02:56:30, News,-3,0

I'd love to hear some people's suggestions on how a better rule could be written. It might also be useful to the discussion for others to poke holes in suggested rules, to see how they could be gamed. Maybe ultimately we can come up with something better...

IMO rules should be very simple to understand in the heat of battle, but also very clear cut to enable easy decision making by the stewards.","['Send it. Let the gods decide.', '""Just do it""', 'Just leave it the way it is with one amendment.  Any car that has established their position with their front tires at minimum in front of the rear tires of the opposing car, either on the inside or the outside of another car, prior to the breaking zone, is entitled to enough space to remain on the racetrack alongside the opposing car throughout the corner or until the leading cars rearmost point is in front of the trailing cars forward most point.', "">How would you write a better overtaking rule?\n\nI wouldn't.\n\nThe problem is that as soon as you codify what overtaking is in the rules, you'll get teams challenging everything that falls outside that definition. And there's often going to be scenarios that arise where you cannot address them.\n\nTake, for instance, the incident between Verstappen and Norris at Turn 4 in Mexico. Norris was slightly ahead of Verstappen going into the corner. Does that mean that he had completed an overtake? No -- as we have seen on countless occasions, you need to be a good way ahead of another driver to overtake around the outside there. But if Norris had been on the inside of the corner, he would need to be much less further ahead of Verstappen to make that pass work. So straight away we have a corner where the criteria for judging the success of an overtake is different depending on the position of the cars on the track. You can't write a rule to address that, because then you'd have to write a rule to address every position going into every corner on every circuit. And that's before we even consider the presence of Sainz in the Turn 4 incident -- he was going through a slow apex when Verstappen and Norris arrived. Verstappen's choices were a) brake hard, b) hit Sainz, or c) take a more shallow line to avoid contact. He chose the third option, which on balance was probably the best option since braking hard risked a lock-up and hitting Sainz was never an option.\n\nThe vast majority of responses to the proposal of writing rules around overtaking seem to have one thing in mind: creating a scenario were Norris can get ever-so-slightly ahead of Verstappen, and thus requiring Verstappen to immediately concede the position."", 'Maybe stay on the track.\nLegal defending must remain within track limits or lose position', 'Both cars stay within track limits. \n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.', '*Attacker* : How bad do you want the position? \n\n*Defender* : How bad do you want to keep the position?', 'No contact, no penalty\n\nLet there be chaos', ""If the attacking car has their front wheel alongside the mirror (the defending car can see this) of the defending car by corner entry then they must be given racing room at the apex and exit as long as any part of their car remains alongside the defenders car.

Max - 8 poles - 7 wins - 3 losses from pole - 2 wins without pole.

Charles - 3 poles - 3 wins - 2 losses from pole - 2 wins without pole.

Lando - 6 poles - 3 wins - 4 losses from pole - 1 win without pole.

Oscar - 0 poles - 2 wins - 0 losses from pole - 2 wins without pole

Lewis - 0 poles - 2 wins - 0 losses from pole - 2 wins without pole.


This is common knowledge but still wanted to highlight. 
Lando stands out. 4 losses after starting in pole in a good enough mclaren.
Either lando is super good in quali or just loses the temperament in the race. There are other factors at times with luck. But max is ruthless when he is ahead. Even charles is there or thereabouts.

In general, very hard to win wdc with this conversation. Basically just depends on others falling back.

If Max holds on, it's because of the opening races being dominant whilst the rest of the season saw multiple teams squabbling over wins.\n\nFerraris update after the summer break has been Red Bulls biggest friend so far. Without it, Lando is probably 20-25 points behind Max currently. But it also means that if McLaren can get ahead of Ferrari, it's a horrendous scenario for Red Bull as you're potentially looking at 5th place.\n\nLando has not been anywhere near good enough at converting his poles though.

1geekse,What was happening with Charles on Sunday? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1geekse/what_was_happening_with_charles_on_sunday/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1geekse/what_was_happening_with_charles_on_sunday/,2024-10-28,0 days,"This is a genuine question because I wasn’t able to watch the race and instead caught glimpses in live timings

The main thing i seen about the race was discourse over regulations and then flashes of discourse from the Ferrari  side.

I kind of assumed it was a bit of dramatics from Charles fans (I am also a Charles fan but sometimes things are blown out of proportion), like claiming Ferrari used team orders to stop Charles overtaking in Australia when Charles was never in the position to.

But I finally decided to go back and see what happened and I am so confused about what happened in the first stint.

I don’t think I have enough technical f1 knowledge to know what Ferrari were trying to do. I seen a comment from Fred after seeming to talk about future engine saving?

How urgent was this because continuing to tell Charles to slow his pace and letting him build such a gap is so risky, unless it was needed to finish the race strong.

Especially when they know Lando’s behind and something that’s been true all season but was especially evident with Mclarens updates the previous race, is Mclaren is a different beast on hards.

In COTA, Mclaren went from not even being close to a threat to having more pace than Ferrari on the hards. Ferrari never had to worry about it cause he was stuck behind Max but if he wasn’t then he would’ve been a threat to at least Carlos.

I think COTA made people almost underestimate the pace of the Mclaren because of the dirty air medium stint, but go back and look at Lando on hards, in dirty air. He had very minimal tire age advantage as well.

So going into the second stint, with no Max in between, that is a very dangerous position to be in.

The second stint seems pretty simple. Good pace, get stuck in dirty air behind cars, have Lando catch up and the push very, very hard to try and stay ahead which hurt his tires, especially cause the majority of his pushing was when overtaking lapped cars.

That was the right plan of action for that stint because Mercedes were too far back to be a threat, and so it’s let Lando past and nurse tires or push hard and burn tires but maybe be able to hold Lando back.

But Charles should’ve been able to have a big enough gap from the medium stint to be able to have a solid pace and manage his tires without having to base it on Lando.

You can never bet against Mclaren (specifically Lando) not having the pace advantage on hards on low fuel. Lando has never not been the fastest in those conditions since Imola, unless something he’s stuck behind someone or other extenuating circumstances.

So what i’m wondering is what was the issue? Was it a we need to do this for the sake of the race and the car or we should do this because it’ll help us later and Charles is in a pretty safe position.

Having two drivers running p1 and p2 when they have similar pace and are close together, especially if the one behind has slightly better pace but nothing to switch positions over is a very difficult situation to handle, so was it Ferrari choosing an advantageous time so the drivers wouldn’t fight each other? 

I’m genuinely asking out of confusion because i feel like i’ve missed so many details and i don’t understand what the radio messages were really meaning.","[""It's likely that the brakes were actually heating up too much, given the thin air in Mexico - this was massively exacerbated by running behind Sainz for a short while, especially the 3 or 4 laps where he was within 1.5 seconds.\n\nI will put a little tweak to your points though. Sainz was faster in Mexico, but in Australia the team did radio to Charles to stop him from fighting Sainz. This was because they didn't think they'd be able to challenge for the win again this season - how wrong they were!"", 'Leclerc was asked to do lico and so was Sainz. However when Leclerc hit the back marker traffic he was told ‘no more lico’ so I assume he was saving his engine for needing to overtake backmarkers. The backmarkers not letting him through quickly enough didn’t help. The McLaren comes alive in the second stint and Norris (who has been saving his tyres for this part of his race) starts eating up the advantage Leclerc built over him throughout the race. Leclerc couldn’t do anything about that as his tyres had gone. Norris was already faster and getting quicker. It was a case of when Norris would pass him not if. He just made it easier by going off the track. \n\nI know that Ferrari radioed Charles to tell him not to fight Sainz, but in their defence it was the right decision. Sainz was faster and they would have lost time fighting knowing that Norris would be coming back at them in the second stint. It worked for Ferrari. I wouldn’t have minded them fighting, it would have been Norris’ win if that happened.', '>You can never bet against Mclaren (specifically Lando) not having the pace advantage on hards on low fuel. Lando has never not been the fastest in those conditions since Imola, unless something he’s stuck behind someone or other extenuating circumstances.\n\nAt the end, it was pretty much this. And then he had the incredible save onto the frontstretch, and that sealed it.', 'There was no issue per se. He had to use LiCo to cool the car and had some holdup from a few backmarkers which closed the gap to Lando.\n\nI’ve seen more than a few fans of a certain fanbase suggest nefarious conspiracies and it really shows how unhinged fans can be.', 'I did not compare his onboard with Carlos. But his brake was nearly overheated all the time, which was caused by dirty air probably. And he was seldom great in Mexico, which may also relate to the LiCo issue.', ""I mean even if there was a serious issue with the PU or overheating with the breaks, i doubt they would say it on the radio outright. plus if these were indirect team orders charles' expression after the race would let you know. he is not good at hiding his displeasure lol.\n\nmy conspiracy theory is ollie's crash in fp1 and the rebuild after that did more damage than expected."", 'Backmarkers fucked him. In short.', '""Nothing"", *walks away*', ""I don'T think that Ollie's crash caused huuuge issues but losing just barely less than a tenth might prove very costly.""]",0,10,2024-10-29 02:56:34, Discussion,0,0

And whatever, if that's how you feel, fair enough. If that somehow makes you feel like you're better than others, I'm happy for you.\n\nBut with so many great drivers at the front and the competition so enjoyable this season, I'm finding myself wishing Verstappen was just out of the picture as the battles and action between everyone else would probably be amazing.

Do you think Oscar is gonna outpace Lando eventually ? If so when would it happen ? In 2023 Piastri was fairly close in qualifying but his tyre management in races was missing (which is not a surprise for a rookie). In 2024 Oscar has not quite closed the gap in qualies but his racecraft has been impressive several times.

I believe the general consensus amongst F1 fans in general is that Norris has more pace while Piastri has a better composure. What do you think is more important then ? Is it speed or mentality ? Also who is more likely to turn things around... is it Lando improving his mentality and his starts or is it Oscar becoming quicker (especially over one lap) ?","['Ask me after the next season, if Piastri is still not matching Norris by the end of that then Norris is better with the higher ceiling.', 'Not in my opinion. People point to this being Oscar’s second season but he’s had 42 races now. In comparison, Lando’s 42nd race was midway through the 2021 season where he was 3rd (yes THIRD) in the drivers championship and ahead of both Perez and Bottas in the clear 3rd/4th best car. He had a run of like 8 top 5 finishes in a row in that car.\n\nI don’t think Oscar has shown that he has the one lap pace of Lando and thats usually something that comes pretty quick, for example we saw Lando outqualify Sainz in his first 2 seasons, and Leclerc outqualify Vettel in his 2nd season. In comparison Oscar is losing 16-4 H2H so far this season.\n\nOscar is still improving but people still don’t like to admit how good Lando is (who is still improving himself), which sometimes makes Oscar look worse than he is. Who knows how it plays out, but I feel like Norris will always have the edge imo', 'Piastri is 1cm taller, so all ceilings will be relatively lower.', ""I have no way to evaluate who has a higher ceiling and I won't pretend to. But what I do find funny and weird is any claim that Piastri will be better because he keeps his composure better and is calmer. Since when is that something necessary for a driver? I don't think many would describe Michael or Senna as calm. Sure it could be a good thing, but to act like it's a sign of a great driver is a bit crazy to me."", 'Not in my opinion. \n\nHe’s not showing Lando’s one lap pace. He’s also not put together a proper dominant win like Lando has in Zandvoort and Singapore. \n\nI think that he and Lando seem to have opposing stinker weekends for whatever reason, which leads to us thinking they’re closer than they are.', 'I find it insane how people often talk about how ""Oscar has improved rapidly"" when he has basically the same average pace gap to Lando now as he did in like the last 1/3rd of 2023', 'What I’m noticing in this thread is how people tend to gloss over Lando’s race pace and tyre management. Everyone acknowledges his qualifying pace and how quick he is over one lap but he gets much less recognition for how he’s able to zoom off into the distance as soon as he gets into clean air and gets more out of his tyres than basically anyone else. His race pace and tyre management is some of the best on the grid. Oscar is quite a bit off matching him in those areas too.', ""I think people should stop asking this question, cut down on the weird Lando hate, and just enjoy watching them both drive.\n\nOscars an excellent driver who's a bit rough around the edges, Lando's a world class driver. It's very easy to start chucking drivers out, until you get the one you want... but why do we all throw every single driver out of the sport when you don't win 7 or 8 world titles.\n\nThat mentality is INSANE and it needs to stop. Be lucky to get one frankly guys."", ""I want people to remember, Norris has never lost a qualifying battle in his career so far as an F1 driver.\n\nOnly other guy on the grid who can say that is Leclerc. \n\nOn top of Lando's excellent qualifying pace (31-11 against Piastri in last 2 seasons in Saturday Qualifying), he's also one of the absolute best at tyre management and banging in consistently excellent laptimes throughout a stint. \n\nLando's weaknesses currently is aggression in wheel to wheel battles and race starts (much improved compared to midseason especially, Baku, Singapore, COTA Sprint, Mexico all were good starts, only bad one was COTA main race, and even that like almost noone in last few years has held the lead into T1, even Verstappen and Leclerc lost the lead in 2021 and 2023 respectively).\n\nAnd as you can see in Mexico, he was much more decisive with Verstappen in the T4 maneuver compared to COTA, which shows his learning process and how he's getting better race by race.\n\nI think Piastri is extremely good, he's still only in his 2nd season and some of these tracks are still new to him. But the talent and potential is undeniable.\n\nI wouldn't say he has a higher ceiling until he starts to show that level consistently. Atleast string together 4-5 races where you constantly outqualify and out race Norris. Even in the races in the middle of the season when he beat Norris like Hungary, Spa, Monza, Etc. he relied on Norris's bad starts to get ahead and then just Norris couldn't get past due to the exact same pace in both cars.""]",0,128,2024-10-29 02:56:36, Discussion,0,2
