1g9dt5h,"With calls for new rule changes after Verstappen's defensive moves, I compiled all the F1 rules changed solely because of Max Verstappen since 2016",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9dt5h/with_calls_for_new_rule_changes_after_verstappens/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9dt5h/with_calls_for_new_rule_changes_after_verstappens/,2024-10-22,0 days,"After the recent controversy surrounding Max Verstappen's defensive driving moves on Lando Norris, I saw a lot of users mention Verstappen being the lead cause of rule changes and forcing the FIA to clarify rules in the past.

I thought it'd be fun to do a deep dive on what changes and clarifications had to be made solely because of him:

*edit: added rule changes 11, 12 and 13, thanks to those who pointed them out!*

*edit: several people requested I make a similar list for Lewis Hamilton. I'll post it tomorrow.*

- - - 

**1. Minimum Age Requirement for F1 Super Licence**

Race: -

Incident: Max Verstappen was signed by Toro Rosso for the 2015 season at just 16 years old, making his F1 debut at 17 years and 166 days—the youngest driver in Formula 1 history.

Rule Change: The FIA introduced new Super Licence requirements effective from the 2016 season. Drivers must be at least 18 years old to be eligible, have accumulated at least 40 points over the previous three seasons in specified lower categories, and have completed a minimum number of kilometers in testing, along with holding a valid road driver's licence.

**2. The ""Verstappen Rule"" – Moving Under Braking**

Race: 2016 Japanese Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen aggressively defended against Lewis Hamilton by moving under braking into the chicane, forcing Hamilton to take evasive action.

Rule Change: The FIA prohibited drivers from changing direction under braking in a way that could cause an avoidable collision. Drivers must not move unpredictably or change direction under braking when defending, and must leave at least one car's width between their own car and the edge of the track when defending.

**3. Expansion of the ""Verstappen Rule"" – Dangerous Defensive Maneuvers**

Race: 2016 Belgian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen made aggressive defensive moves against Kimi Räikkönen, including moving under braking and weaving on straights, leading to safety concerns.

Rule Change: The FIA expanded the rule to penalize any dangerous defensive maneuvers. Drivers are not allowed to make more than one change of direction to defend a position. Any movement that impedes another driver in a dangerous manner is prohibited, and stewards were given increased authority to penalize unsportsmanlike conduct.

**4. Use of Alternate Lines and Track Limits**

Race: 2017 United States Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen overtook Kimi Räikkönen for third place on the final lap by going off-track and cutting inside the track limits at Turn 17.

Rule Clarification: The FIA provided clarifying definitions of track limits and enforced consistent penalties. The track is defined by the white lines; drivers must keep at least one wheel within these lines at all times. Overtaking or gaining a lasting advantage by leaving the track is prohibited. Stewards were instructed to apply penalties uniformly for track limit violations.

**5. Driver Conduct and Physical Altercations**

Race: 2018 Brazilian Grand Prix

Incident: After a collision with Esteban Ocon, Verstappen confronted and physically pushed Ocon multiple times in the FIA weigh-in area.

Rule Change: The FIA strengthened regulations against unsportsmanlike conduct off the track. Drivers must conduct themselves professionally and with respect. Physical altercations can result in penalties such as community service, fines, or suspension, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the sport's integrity.

**6. Formation Lap Overtaking Clarification**

Race: 2021 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton during the formation lap before the race start.

Rule Clarification: The FIA clarified rules regarding formation lap conduct. Drivers must maintain their grid positions during the formation lap unless a car is delayed leaving the grid. Overtaking is only permitted if a car is delayed and others cannot avoid passing it without unduly delaying the remainder of the field. Procedures were clarified to ensure all drivers understand acceptable behavior before the race start.

**7. Clarification on Forcing a Driver Off-Track**

Race: 2021 Brazilian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen defended his position by pushing Lewis Hamilton wide at Turn 4, causing both cars to leave the track.

Rule Clarification: The FIA issued clearer guidelines on overtaking and defending. If an overtaking car is significantly alongside, the defending driver must leave at least one car's width of space. Drivers must not deliberately force another driver off the track. Detailed criteria were provided for stewards to assess incidents consistently.

**8. Technical Regulations on Rear Wings and Parc Fermé**

Race: 2021 Brazilian Grand Prix

Incident: After qualifying, Verstappen touched and inspected Hamilton's rear wing in parc fermé conditions.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced rules regarding parc fermé conditions. Drivers and team personnel are prohibited from touching or examining rival cars during parc fermé. Strict penalties, including fines and sporting penalties, can be applied for violations. Security measures were enhanced, with increased monitoring and enforcement.

**9. Double Yellow Flag Compliance**

Race: 2021 Qatar Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen failed to sufficiently slow down for double-waved yellow flags during qualifying.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced the importance of yellow flag compliance. Stricter penalties were introduced for Verstappen's failing to respect yellow flags.

**10. Brake Testing and Sudden Deceleration**

Race: 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen braked suddenly in front of Hamilton while attempting to let him pass, leading to a collision.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced rules against dangerous driving behaviors. Sudden deceleration or ""brake testing"" that endangers other drivers is strictly prohibited. Procedures for safely yielding positions were clarified, including proper communication protocols between teams and race control. Stricter penalties were introduced to deter such actions.

**11. Restrictions on Post-Race Celebrations and dangerous driving over the Finish Line**
 
(*edit - suggested by /u/SomewhereAlarmed9985)*

Race: 2021 Styrian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen slowed down and performed burnouts or drifted over the finish line to celebrate his victory, which was deemed potentially dangerous.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced regulations prohibiting dangerous driving after the chequered flag, including burnouts and drifting over the finish line. Drivers are required to proceed safely to parc fermé after finishing the race. Post-race celebrations must not endanger other drivers, marshals, or spectators.

**12. Safety Car Restart Procedure Change**

Race: 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen often drew alongside the car ahead during safety car restarts, notably during the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix where he pulled alongside Lewis Hamilton before the restart.

Rule Change: The FIA updated the safety car restart procedures:
Drivers must remain in a single line without overlapping until the race resumes.
Overtaking or drawing alongside another car before crossing the start/finish line after the safety car has pulled into the pits is prohibited.
Drivers cannot gain an advantage by positioning themselves alongside the car ahead during a restart.


**13. Clarification of Pitlane Exit Rules**

(*edit- suggested by user /u/Buffythedragonslayer)

Race: 2023 Monaco Grand Prix

Incident: During the race, Max Verstappen appeared to cross the pit exit line when rejoining the track, leading to controversy over whether he violated the rules.

Rule Clarification: The FIA tweaked the pitlane exit rules to clarify that drivers must not cross any part of their car over the pit exit line when rejoining the track. The updated rule specifies that touching or crossing the line with any part of the car constitutes a violation.

While some or all of those may be true at times. Its another things to actively give the people who believe that ammunition. \n\n  \nMy wife was a casual observer of the race and even she was confused on exactly why Lando was penalized. Esepcially in the context of me explaining to her why George Russell was penalized with Bottas earlier. \n\nIt just makes it so anyone who isn't in the thick of this sport to feel like there are no rules and everything has a degree of fixing to make sure certain players do well which isn't true but the optics are everything sometimes.  Especially when you are trying to reach new people, just not appease people who are already invested."", ""The defending car should never be allowed to push the attacker off track when they don't make the corner themselves. It is stupid in every angle. It ruins championship fights, because the one in the lead can simply drive like it's bumper cars, since they will still have the upper hand if both of them crash out of the race. We saw this to the extreme in Brazil 21 and after, where Lewis had to actively dodge Max every single time or they'd both crash because Max was given zero reason to care by the rules. That in itself is a massive flaw in the rulebook, it needs action ASAP.\n\nI want to watch skillful fights within the track limits.

It's interesting. He's pretty detail-oriented. Sometimes you have to help him a little bit to understand what he's feeling and put it into words, but I think he's not too different from Alex (Albon). He's understanding very well and being very sensitive to the car itself, which is very helpful, and even in the simulator, which is very different to the race car, he's always quite detailed and can give us good direction and understand what the limitations are.”\n\n“He loves to talk. You probably see him in interviews. I've been pushing him to try to be concise in his comments. And it's funny, sometimes he gets carried away. I think that's the Latin philosophy, the way you live. You just express yourself a lot. It's very different from what you see in countries like England, where people are more straight to the point. It's very interesting,” he said.\n\nThe French engineer recalled what happened when he first worked with Colapinto in the simulator that the Williams team has at its Grove factory.\n\n“It's something we worked a lot at the beginning, in the simulator sessions. The first time he made a start and stopped, I think I ran out of space to write down his comments. He's more concise (now), he can still work on it,” he said with a chuckle.\n\nJego explained why it is important for Colapinto, or for that matter any Formula 1 driver, to be precise when describing what he feels with the single-seater upon returning to the garage.\n\n“When you do short starts, even in practice, the moments (to talk) are never really long. Maybe you have 90 seconds, two minutes with the driver for a quick chat. Then it needs to be really effective. And I think he's fine with that now.”\n\n“I think it's a good exercise, because if you're able to give feedback that's concise, that means it's also clear in your head. It's getting better, it's getting better. With you (the media), I don't know, maybe the heart speaks more than the head,” he finished.\n\n\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)"", 'Love how the ""talk less"" is nothing to do with his interviews or anything media related.\n\nYet most of the comments are exactly that 😂', ""Did the writer purposefully word the title to be a bit 'clickbaity?

Teams spend too much money on protection then complain about lack of R&D. Then they are so afraid of protecting their merch and fanbase they won't bring in new talent to replace the checked out drivers who don't seem to be there to prove anything.\n\nMore young drivers desperate to scrap for every point!

1g9y36u,The Last stand of Defensive driving?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9y36u/the_last_stand_of_defensive_driving/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9y36u/the_last_stand_of_defensive_driving/,2024-10-23,0 days,"The Verstappen-Norris incident has opened a wide debate about what exactly should be allowed from a defending car in the corner phase of a battle.

As things stand , it appears that the car defending a place has the upperhamd in this area especially if they are in the inside. 

They can take whatever line they want as long as they get to the apex first, regardless of how far along side the rival is. We've seen Max in particular benefit from this rule this time at COTA.

Beong on the inside has always been the winning strategy in these types of battles between it in attack or defense. That's why the ""block pass""or ""block defense""  is the most common form of attack/defense in the sport.

A new rule change that forces the inside car to give up a car's width at all times on exit will instantly shift the power to the outside car because the inside line generally compromises exit speed. It'd mean that suddenly no one wants to be on the inside at all.

And it'll make defending almost impossible.

As it stands we already have DRS. It's also against the rules to weave on the straights to break a tow. It's illegal to move more than once in the braking zone as well.

The attacking car has an advantage on the whole straight all the way into the braking zone with our current rules.

The only place where a defending car has any advantage is on the inside of a corner. Where they are allowed to dictate their line on exit as long as  they are ahead at the apex.

Removing this defensive  advantage will make defending positions almost impossible with the rest of the current rule set. All it'll result into is defending cars probably giving up the position even before the braking zone to avoid losing laptime rather than risk penalties.

The only acceptable amendment is probably ensuring that even if you push the other car wide, you must stay within the white line as well.

There has to be an allowance for defending in the sport otherwise passing will become a formality.

Edit : The rules are skewed in favour of attacking cars already, do we actually have to remove the one piece of track where the defending car has the upperhand?

Thoughts?





","['Max himself shown that defensive driving doesn\'t need to be about shoving drivers off the road up until lap 52. And guess what, everyone loved seeing that, smart positioning of the car and forcing the car behind to take suboptimal, but also WITHIN the track lines was a treat for all to watch. On the other hand, if everyone took the rule to the extreme like Max did, there will be no need to try passing on the outside, the only overtakes that are viable will be DRS blasts down the straight that needs to be completed before the corner or down the inside.\n\nF1 does not have a ""defending is too hard"" issue, we\'ve only spent the last decade complaining about how bad the dirty air issue got resulting in very little overtakes.', ""Max performed stellar defence on Lando for several laps without using the full extent of the rules like he did in Norris' penalty incident (in a completely legal if unsporting way). Including into turn 1, which is after a straight with DRS. Also the defending will always have 1 big advantage, which is choosing the line. If the inside line somehow gets too weak, he's welcome to try the outside (nobody ever will, outside of the banked corner in Zandvoort).\n\nAlonso defended from a much faster Perez in Brazil for an uncountable amount of laps without needing to resort to crude divebombs.\n\nYour concern is very exaggerated."", 'You do realize in that the front car can still pick which lane to defend....', 'McLaren messed this up by giving the wrong info to Norris that he was ahead at the apex.

There’s all the ways to do it in terms of generating uncertainty in the other driver, forcing them on to the worse line the long way round and still pushing them to the outside of the track (but not off), you can also simply try to reach the exit as quick as possible making it there before the overtaking car is entitled to room on their outside line (you can still drive them into a wedge essentially, as long as they don’t make it significantly alongside)\n\n>Attacking car has advantage on the whole straight \n\nthis is true although it’s worth noting that the defending car has the advantage throughout the rest of the lap, the drs is supposed to compensate for the dirty air effect. And weaving on the straight and moving in the braking zone are just kind of safety issues.\n\n>The only advantage is on the inside\n\nWell no, there are times drivers might choose the outside e.g. for the switchback, and it is still advantageous to be on the inside, but if you’re opponent gets themselves into a good position you just can’t shove them off.', 'I think if you could somehow put Max in both cars in that scenario, a wreck would be inevitable.

These latest changes to the guidelines tilt the scales even more to the defending car and worse, discourage side-by-side racing.\n\nI don't think anybody really wants to completely remove the ability to defend from F1, what Max did up until lap 52 was amazing racing and fair in all of motorsport, he used his advantage as the lead car to make it extremely difficult to get past. What happened on lap 52 was different, the guidelines should promote racing in corners and multiple corners. Unfortunately, if you take these guidelines to the extreme (which all drivers will eventually do) then the only way to pass will be a DRS glide by on the outside.

It will not shift just because we won't allow drivers to purposefully release the brake with no intention of making the corner just to be ahead at an arbitrary point which allows them to disregard racing. \n\nI cannot stress this enough how this stupidity went out of control at the end of 2021 and got legalized in 2022""]",0,33,2024-10-23 02:53:28, Discussion,0,14

1g9ww01,Part of the confusion around the Norris-Verstappen incident seems to be around the misinterpretation of a rule,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9ww01/part_of_the_confusion_around_the_norrisverstappen/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9ww01/part_of_the_confusion_around_the_norrisverstappen/,2024-10-22,0 days,">In order for a car being overtaken to be required to give sufficient room to an overtaking car, the overtaking car needs to have a significant portion of the car alongside the car being overtaken and the overtaking manoeuvre must be done in a safe and controlled manner, while enabling the car to clearly remain within the limits of the track. 

>When considering what is a ‘significant portion’, for an overtaking on the outside of a corner, among the various factors that will be looked at by the stewards when exercising their discretion, the stewards will consider if the overtaking car is ahead of the other car from the apex of the corner. **The car being overtaken must be capable of making the corner while remaining within the limits of the track.**

People seem to be struggling with this last line. 

This **does not** mean that the car being overtaken will be penalised if they are not able to stay on track on their own. Which is why they chose the wording ""must be **capable** of making the corner"", rather than simply stating that they must make the corner, must remain on track, or that they must remain within track limits. 

The rule actually means that when a car is being overtaken, it must still **be able** to navigate the corner without being forced off track by the overtaking car. Essentially, the overtaking maneuver should not force the overtaken car to exceed the track limits or lose control.

In practical terms, this ensures that the overtaking driver must execute the pass cleanly and safely, allowing the overtaken car enough space to stay within the track boundaries while making the corner. ","['4 more days to go.', 'Brother, I am tired and it’s only Tuesday.', 'The fucking horse is dead, stop beating it!!!', 'Thing is, both portions you posted contradict each other.\n\nIs it required to be ""sufficiently alongside"" in order to deserve space on the outside, or is it only when ahead by the apex?\nThey don\'t even put it in black and white terms what ""sufficiently alongside"" is, because they are nothing more than a bunch of cowards.', ""The problem with this is if you watch them going into the corner and downstraight before the corner Lando is passed to nearly all the way passed Max. However Max on the inside just drives into corner straight with no intention of making the corner just so he can reach the apex first. As he knows  no matter what happens if he reachs the apex first he will hold the spot. \n\nSo the issue is Lando never had a chance of staying within the ruleset. As he if he turns in properly before the corner he is going to turn directly into Max. So he can only go straight, wreck his car, or just attempt to slow down so much it doesn't matter anymore. \n\nThe rules don't actually work. As your synopsis at the bottom is basically saying everything Max didn't do. As he was already overtaken going down the straight and then Max was attempting to repass on the inside going into the corner. He didn't allow Lando the opportunity to cleanly stay within track limits.\n\nThe entire issue is perspective and who you view as in what place at what time As you can argue its Max's place until Lando gets through corner but you could also argue its Lando place as he passed Max on the straight and now Max is attempting to repass lando in the corner. \n\nThe rules need to be better. As both cars have a right to the trackspace. The rules should state the driver on the side has to provide enough room for the driver on the outside to stay within track limits. Otherwise there is no reason for anyone to ever do a clean pass. Just drive straight and hit the apex first and whatever happens after that be damned as you hit the apex first.
