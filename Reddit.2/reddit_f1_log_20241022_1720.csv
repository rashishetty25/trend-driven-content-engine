I thought it'd be fun to do a deep dive on what changes and clarifications had to be made solely because of him:

*edit: added rule changes 11, 12 and 13, thanks to those who pointed them out!*

*edit: several people requested I make a similar list for Lewis Hamilton. I'll post it tomorrow.*

- - - 

**1. Minimum Age Requirement for F1 Super Licence**

Race: -

Incident: Max Verstappen was signed by Toro Rosso for the 2015 season at just 16 years old, making his F1 debut at 17 years and 166 days—the youngest driver in Formula 1 history.

Rule Change: The FIA introduced new Super Licence requirements effective from the 2016 season. Drivers must be at least 18 years old to be eligible, have accumulated at least 40 points over the previous three seasons in specified lower categories, and have completed a minimum number of kilometers in testing, along with holding a valid road driver's licence.

**2. The ""Verstappen Rule"" – Moving Under Braking**

Race: 2016 Japanese Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen aggressively defended against Lewis Hamilton by moving under braking into the chicane, forcing Hamilton to take evasive action.

Rule Change: The FIA prohibited drivers from changing direction under braking in a way that could cause an avoidable collision. Drivers must not move unpredictably or change direction under braking when defending, and must leave at least one car's width between their own car and the edge of the track when defending.

**3. Expansion of the ""Verstappen Rule"" – Dangerous Defensive Maneuvers**

Race: 2016 Belgian Grand Prix
2
Incident: Verstappen made aggressive defensive moves against Kimi Räikkönen, including moving under braking and weaving on straights, leading to safety concerns.

Rule Change: The FIA expanded the rule to penalize any dangerous defensive maneuvers. Drivers are not allowed to make more than one change of direction to defend a position. Any movement that impedes another driver in a dangerous manner is prohibited, and stewards were given increased authority to penalize unsportsmanlike conduct.

**4. Use of Alternate Lines and Track Limits**

Race: 2017 United States Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen overtook Kimi Räikkönen for third place on the final lap by going off-track and cutting inside the track limits at Turn 17.

Rule Clarification: The FIA provided clarifying definitions of track limits and enforced consistent penalties. The track is defined by the white lines; drivers must keep at least one wheel within these lines at all times. Overtaking or gaining a lasting advantage by leaving the track is prohibited. Stewards were instructed to apply penalties uniformly for track limit violations.

**5. Driver Conduct and Physical Altercations**

Race: 2018 Brazilian Grand Prix

Incident: After a collision with Esteban Ocon, Verstappen confronted and physically pushed Ocon multiple times in the FIA weigh-in area.

Rule Change: The FIA strengthened regulations against unsportsmanlike conduct off the track. Drivers must conduct themselves professionally and with respect. Physical altercations can result in penalties such as community service, fines, or suspension, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the sport's integrity.

**6. Formation Lap Overtaking Clarification**

Race: 2021 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton during the formation lap before the race start.

Rule Clarification: The FIA clarified rules regarding formation lap conduct. Drivers must maintain their grid positions during the formation lap unless a car is delayed leaving the grid. Overtaking is only permitted if a car is delayed and others cannot avoid passing it without unduly delaying the remainder of the field. Procedures were clarified to ensure all drivers understand acceptable behavior before the race start.

**7. Clarification on Forcing a Driver Off-Track**

Race: 2021 Brazilian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen defended his position by pushing Lewis Hamilton wide at Turn 4, causing both cars to leave the track.

Rule Clarification: The FIA issued clearer guidelines on overtaking and defending. If an overtaking car is significantly alongside, the defending driver must leave at least one car's width of space. Drivers must not deliberately force another driver off the track. Detailed criteria were provided for stewards to assess incidents consistently.

**8. Technical Regulations on Rear Wings and Parc Fermé**

Race: 2021 Brazilian Grand Prix

Incident: After qualifying, Verstappen touched and inspected Hamilton's rear wing in parc fermé conditions.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced rules regarding parc fermé conditions. Drivers and team personnel are prohibited from touching or examining rival cars during parc fermé. Strict penalties, including fines and sporting penalties, can be applied for violations. Security measures were enhanced, with increased monitoring and enforcement.

**9. Double Yellow Flag Compliance**

Race: 2021 Qatar Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen failed to sufficiently slow down for double-waved yellow flags during qualifying.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced the importance of yellow flag compliance. Stricter penalties were introduced for Verstappen's failing to respect yellow flags.

**10. Brake Testing and Sudden Deceleration**

Race: 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen braked suddenly in front of Hamilton while attempting to let him pass, leading to a collision.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced rules against dangerous driving behaviors. Sudden deceleration or ""brake testing"" that endangers other drivers is strictly prohibited. Procedures for safely yielding positions were clarified, including proper communication protocols between teams and race control. Stricter penalties were introduced to deter such actions.

**11. Restrictions on Post-Race Celebrations and dangerous driving over the Finish Line**
 
(*edit - suggested by /u/SomewhereAlarmed9985)*

Race: 2021 Styrian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen slowed down and performed burnouts or drifted over the finish line to celebrate his victory, which was deemed potentially dangerous.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced regulations prohibiting dangerous driving after the chequered flag, including burnouts and drifting over the finish line. Drivers are required to proceed safely to parc fermé after finishing the race. Post-race celebrations must not endanger other drivers, marshals, or spectators.

**12. Safety Car Restart Procedure Change**

Race: 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen often drew alongside the car ahead during safety car restarts, notably during the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix where he pulled alongside Lewis Hamilton before the restart.

Rule Change: The FIA updated the safety car restart procedures:
Drivers must remain in a single line without overlapping until the race resumes.
Overtaking or drawing alongside another car before crossing the start/finish line after the safety car has pulled into the pits is prohibited.
Drivers cannot gain an advantage by positioning themselves alongside the car ahead during a restart.


**13. Clarification of Pitlane Exit Rules**

(*edit- suggested by user /u/Buffythedragonslayer)

Race: 2023 Monaco Grand Prix

Incident: During the race, Max Verstappen appeared to cross the pit exit line when rejoining the track, leading to controversy over whether he violated the rules.

Rule Clarification: The FIA tweaked the pitlane exit rules to clarify that drivers must not cross any part of their car over the pit exit line when rejoining the track. The updated rule specifies that touching or crossing the line with any part of the car constitutes a violation.

It's interesting. He's pretty detail-oriented. Sometimes you have to help him a little bit to understand what he's feeling and put it into words, but I think he's not too different from Alex (Albon). He's understanding very well and being very sensitive to the car itself, which is very helpful, and even in the simulator, which is very different to the race car, he's always quite detailed and can give us good direction and understand what the limitations are.”\n\n“He loves to talk. You probably see him in interviews. I've been pushing him to try to be concise in his comments. And it's funny, sometimes he gets carried away. I think that's the Latin philosophy, the way you live. You just express yourself a lot. It's very different from what you see in countries like England, where people are more straight to the point. It's very interesting,” he said.\n\nThe French engineer recalled what happened when he first worked with Colapinto in the simulator that the Williams team has at its Grove factory.\n\n“It's something we worked a lot at the beginning, in the simulator sessions. The first time he made a start and stopped, I think I ran out of space to write down his comments. He's more concise (now), he can still work on it,” he said with a chuckle.\n\nJego explained why it is important for Colapinto, or for that matter any Formula 1 driver, to be precise when describing what he feels with the single-seater upon returning to the garage.\n\n“When you do short starts, even in practice, the moments (to talk) are never really long. Maybe you have 90 seconds, two minutes with the driver for a quick chat. Then it needs to be really effective. And I think he's fine with that now.”\n\n“I think it's a good exercise, because if you're able to give feedback that's concise, that means it's also clear in your head. It's getting better, it's getting better. With you (the media), I don't know, maybe the heart speaks more than the head,” he finished.\n\n\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)"", 'Love how the ""talk less"" is nothing to do with his interviews or anything media related.\n\nYet most of the comments are exactly that 😂', ""Did the writer purposefully word the title to be a bit 'clickbaity?

Mmmm… who knows. \n\n- Perez out. Liam/Yuki promoted to RBR. Franco to VCARB. Still a bit unlikely that RB won’t go for Hadjar instead. \n\n- Franco to Sauber/Audi. Bottas to Mercedes as reserve driver. That’s the one we all know. Bortoleto and Mick are also contenders. Not sure who is ahead of who in the race here. Media is all over the place. I still believe Bottas has a solid chance. \n\nAnd finally this is just a crazy rumour:\n\n- Alex might get tempted by Sauber/Audi for a 3 years deal as I read on social media. This seems very VERY unlikely. That tweet that OP referred to reads “one coming and one going”. That would be Sainz coming and Alex going to Sauber/Audi. So, it aligns? Anyhow. Crazy. But, still counts as a possibility.\n\nEdit: I totally forgot about the Perez/Albon trade that was rumoured at the beginning of the season. \n\n- Alex to RBR, Checo to Williams but then Checo moves to Audi/Sauber for 1 year (last year) and Colapinto stays at Williams promoted from the Academy.

By mouth of General Director Amaury Bertholomé and Technical Director Elisabeth Guillaume, the plans for the next two years were presented to the press.*\n\n*""The works include improvements to make the circuit more comfortable and enjoyable. These changes are already noticeable this year, but in the coming years we will continue to work relentlessly to achieve that goal,"" said Amaury Bertholomé.*\n\n*Thus, a new medical centre will be built at the zone Martin-Fagne, in the lower area of the paddock, with new sanitary blocks as well. Opposite l\'arbre qui tue, in turn, a commercial zone will be developed, with a kind of pedestrian zone for all kinds of commercial activities.*\n\n*A new entrance and spectacular views*\n\n*But surely the most spectacular innovations are an entirely new entrance to Ster and, above all, an entirely new tower with pedestrian bridge, where the Uniroyal tower now stands.*\n\n*""To create a real access point and reception area for the Spa-Francorchamps Circuit, we will demolish part of the old farmhouse and demolish the old sanitary facilities. Office and meeting rooms will be set up on the upper floors. A pedestrian bridge will span the Route du Fagnou and mark the entrance to the circuit."" The completion of this work is scheduled for October 2025,"" said another General Manager.*\n\n*So the famous tower will also disappear, to make way for a very nice new project: ""There will be a new four-storey tower. Two levels will be set up as Sim Pro areas and three levels will be set up as reception areas with panoramic terraces, a rooftop and a new stage, which will accommodate a total of 450 guests. New advertising spaces will also be provided, with the integration of LED screens."" These works will be carried out in 2026.*\n\n*We will also see a new area on Old Customs, located between the Raidillon grandstand and the Fan Zone, where the existing buildings will be restored (two buildings), with the integration of didactic panels in the existing windows, the creation of a park and the creation of a new, safe pedestrian pathway, in other words a passageway providing access between the Raidillon and the park. Provision will also be made for a Food & Beverage point and a picnic area.*\n\n*There will also be a new workshop for the technical services at Raidillon and a new campsite for the track volunteers at Blanchimont. Finally, Race Control will be further modernised and the track will also be further adapted to current safety standards.*', 'What a terrible website, blocking right-clicks so I cannot access my text-to-speech on the translation!']",60,3,2024-10-22 17:20:33, News,8,0
1g9m354,Ferrari brought an adjusted front wing to Austin - but didn't have to declare it because it was only a composite material change,https://formu1a.uno/it/sviluppi-ferrari-ce-un-importante-retroscena-sui-miglioramenti-della-sf-24/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9m354/ferrari_brought_an_adjusted_front_wing_to_austin/,2024-10-22,0 days,,"['> Initially, the new front wing design was set to debut in Austin, but it appeared earlier in Singapore. **A \'base\' version of the wing was further developed in Texas with more flexible composite materials.** It was an undeclared update, as the aerodynamic shapes of the wing remained the same, but it provided a significant boost in high-speed efficiency, where the SF-24 surprisingly emerged as the best car.\n\n[From another article:](https://formu1a.uno/it/doppietta-ferrari-vasseur-sviluppiamo-fino-in-qatar/)\n\n> ""Updates? Use your imagination,"" he said somewhat cryptically, even laughing, without going into details. As reported, a new feature on the SF-24 was indeed present, but the team did not have to declare it to the FIA, as it was not of an aerodynamic nature. ""**You only have to declare aerodynamic updates that change the external shapes of the components.** But we\'re all pushing, including us."" One of the technical themes this year has certainly been flexible wings, and in Singapore, after reassurances from the FIA, Ferrari introduced their new front wing and is continuing in that direction. ""It\'s not a game-changer, but every millisecond can make a difference, so we have to develop in this direction,"" said Vasseur.\n\nI thought this was very interesting since there\'s been a lot of discussion about Ferrari bringing ""no upgrades"" this week. While technically true, they did make other changes to the front wing that they didn\'t have to submit to the FIA and this surely had an impact. This was reported right after Singapore (Ferrari investing more into their composite materials, rather than parts upgrades) but was only confirmed by Vasseur post-race.\n\nAlso, in the second article, Vasseur says Ferrari was not one of the teams asked to change anything about their car like people were speculating earlier in the week.', 'Ferrari are really very much still in contention for the constructors title. By stealth somehow.', ""Like genuinely, if they hadn't pulled that disappearing act in those 3 or 4 races immediately after Monaco Leclerc would be within like 30ish points of Max, and Ferrari would be up there with McLaren for the constructors. If they keep up this pace (and it looks like it will, they have been very very solid the past couple races) that stretch is going to cost them dearly."", 'I thought speculation was about Mercedes and Mclaren ?', 'There was an article on Friday quoting a FIA representative saying other teams had to change their cars too, not just McLaren, and some of the comments were speculating it could be an unexpected team like Ferrari. I just added it since Vasseur himself clarifies this at the end and some people might be curious:\n\n> Ferrari was a third party in this case, not involved, and Vasseur maintained a more neutral stance. ""It\'s not up to me to decide what\'s legal or not. We have to trust the FIA. Ferrari hasn’t had to change anything.""']",61,6,2024-10-22 17:20:34, News,61,6

Now that the dust has settled in Austin, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyse the results.

Low effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will be deleted. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').

Thanks!","['Most people here probably don’t care since it is Alpine, but I feel bad for Gasly’s race. He qualified top of the midfield and ahead of Perez, plus with both Mercs starting near the end was able to start P6. And Gasly was able to hold onto that P6 throughout the first stint. \n\nThen Magnussen in P7 attempted the undercut by pitting early and Gasly tried to cover it off yet somehow Alpine gave him an horribly slow 6.9 second pit stop that both Crofty and Brundle failed to notice on the broadcast. \n\nFrom there Gasly got stuck behind traffic with other medium runners going much longer and his race was pretty much over by that point. He was up in 10th in the final laps but Lawson and Colapinto both got past on the alternative strategy with fresh mediums against his old hards. \n\nAll in all it was a poor race for Alpine with Ocon being spun around Albon at the start of the race too. At least Alpine were wise enough to tell Ocon to steal the fastest lap away from Colapinto before the end of the race to reduce Williams’ lead over Alpine to 4 points for 8th in the constructor’s. But it feels like the Williams has looked faster than Alpine in the last few rounds so it is hard to see Alpine overcoming that deficit with only five rounds left.', ""It cannot be stressed enough how poorly Checo is doing. George Russell started from the pitlane, had a 5 second penalty, and still finished in front of him. How is this possible? Where is it all going wrong for him? \n\nThe F1 community memed that Red Bull would lose the constructor's championship when they refused to drop him over the Summer Break, and now it looks even more likely they're going to slip to THIRD because of him. \n\nAlso, Liam Lawson from the back of the field to points. Good overtakes, great pace, VCARB finally doing something right for one of their drivers. I can't imagine the kind of pressure Lawson would've been under after getting a little chewed out by Fernando Alonso, and then dude comes right back and does some great overtaking and gets two points. You love to see it."", 'Checo went under the radar this weekend. At one point he was behind Colapinto and I assumed he hadn’t pitted yet. Then Crofty said that Perez had pitted 10 laps ago. It took him forever to get past a Williams and he had newer tyres. He’s in a Red Bull. Russell started in the pit lane, finished ahead *and* he had a 5s penalty in all of that as well. I think there was also a point where the commentators said that Perez was going to end up catching the McLarens. I don’t know what pace that was based on but I’m pretty sure he had just gotten past Colapinto at that stage. It’s inexplicable how he continues to put in these kinds of performances and then you get Horner saying that they need Checo to perform because the Ferrari and McLarens are hunting in packs. And it’s like…what were you honestly expecting, it’s not like he was performing well at the time of the contract renewal is it.', 'What was up with Sainz’s Ferrari smelling of fuel? The pit wall told him a mode to go to and that was the last I heard of it.', ""Not going to talk about Max vs Lando since there's been endless debates about it on multiple other posts and there will continue to be until Mexico.\n\nFerrari's 1-2 was their most convincing performance as a team since Bahrain 2022 (and Austria that year as well but Carlos engine blew up), once Charles got into the lead he simply drove off into the distance, and Carlos was able to comfortably finish P2 despite boxing early to undercut Max.\n\nGeorge deserves credit for an impressive charge up to P6 despite starting from the pit lane and having a 5 second penalty on top of it. It was the best result he could've got even if he'd started where he qualified.\n\nThe stars of the race were Lawson and Colapinto, both executed the hard-medium strategy to perfection. Lawson should've been DOTD, finishing only behind Hulk in the midfield battle after starting from the back. Colapinto again getting points, and comprehensively outperforming Albon this weekend (on a track he's never been to as well). Lawson has gone a long way towards proving that from a sporting perspective the decision to bring him in for Ricciardo was the right one, and Colapinto might even get himself a 2025 drive with these performances or at the least drive up his stock substantially for 2026."", 'Ferrari scored 55 points out of the available 59 points in the weekend. Amazing \n\nYuki crumbled under pressure again with the spin and his reaction to Lawson coming in front of him is all people need to know why he should not be promoted to RBR', ""Great performance from Lawson for a first GP in a while. Had solid race pace on hards, would have been nice if he wasn't carrying 60 place penalty and could've had a chance to send it in Q2.\xa0 I get the impression that Yuki can get a bit flustered by having a junior teammate outperform him.\xa0\n\n\nA little disappointed that McLaren made the call to encourage Lando to not give the position back. It looked for all money to be an off track overtake and with not giving it back, it meant we don't get a steward ruling on Max's off track defending.\xa0"", 'For it being Austin, the off the track theatrics were pretty subdued this year. Where was Shaq in an oversized Cadillac driving Leclec to the podium?', ""It's sort of weird that Ferrari were so blazingly fast in race pace. I mean yes, Leclerc got a fantastic start and in clean air he just cruised to victory, but I don't think either Red Bull or McLaren had an answer for Ferrari's pace. They were all close on the hards, but that Ferrari was unbelievably good on the mediums, watching him pull 7 tenths a lap on Max in the mediums was insane. I'm also still shocked that Max managed to finish ahead of both McLarens while being in a slower car. A good race but these cars are already almost as bad as the pre 2022 ones when it comes to racing, even in a car with a significant tire advantage, the dirty air effect seems really bad. Or maybe it's just Norris who's not good at going wheel to wheel."", 'Clearly Hard -> Med was the superior and faster strategy this weekend (Russell, Lawson, Colapinto)']",42,176,2024-10-22 17:20:36, Day after Debrief,-2,6
