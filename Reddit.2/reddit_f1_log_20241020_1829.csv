1g7ltgt,Much Needed Context Behind the Alonso and Lawson Squabble,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7ltgt/much_needed_context_behind_the_alonso_and_lawson/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7ltgt/much_needed_context_behind_the_alonso_and_lawson/,2024-10-19,0 days,"So I looked at the onboards of lap 1. Lawson was overly aggressive with his racecraft on lap 1. Let me do a walk through:


On T11 of lap 1, he divebombed, and punted Alonso fully off the track. On that same straight, he weaved around the straight when Alonso came back at him, and Alonso had to take avoiding action.



In lap 5, Lawson was also moving under braking on turn 11. Later that lap, he closed the door on him in turn 18.


Then when you look at THE incident, Liam, again, moved pretty late on the straight to the point that alonso had to lift. The big issue there is that their scrapping meant that ocon got past. 


Alonso‚Äôs reaction is from a culmination of the incidents prior to the one where Ocon got past. I‚Äôm surprised that everybody jumped to the Alonso bullying narrative instead of posting the onboards of lap 1 and 5, that showed that Liam was too aggressive. ","[""Last year, Lawson was actually like that when he was in Super Formula, so I'm not surprised.  \nHe achieved good results with his ‚ÄúI'm not going to stay here long, so I don't care if you guys don't like me‚Äù approach.  \nWell, anyway, he is a tougher racer than most people think.\n\nEDIT: For clarification  \nThe quotation marks do not mean what he said, but that I felt that way about his approach.  \n(Sorry if anyone misunderstood.)"", 'Where is the video son? We need the video', 'Still, I don\'t understand how thats bad for Lawson\'s career (""It\'s his career down the line"") or being stupid given he only has 6 races. \n\nIf it proves he can be aggressive when needed, and if he end up even 1 place higher than otherwise, then the team will not complain. If anything it proves he is able to take measured risks.  Might not be to Alonso\'s liking, but making it be that he was driving stupidly is just not it.\n\nIf he had been penalized I would agree. But he wasn\'t.', "">I‚Äôm surprised that everybody jumped to the Alonso bullying narrative\xa0\n\nShouldn't be surprised, based on Nando's history. I wouldn't call it bullying, I'd just say he goes a bit overtop about other drivers even when he's out of the car. In the car with adrenaline pumping is understandable, they all do it. But to talk to the media about a rookie like that? It's just unbecoming. \n\nAnd then apparently Fernando told Liam he was gonna do something about it during quali? Sheesh."", 'Take your well informed analysis away from here, we don‚Äôt need it', 'I stopped reading at the ""out of line"". Much needed context? It\'s motor racing, bro.', ""This is not context at all lmao this is just your opinion!\n\nLap 1 T11 is not a divebomb, Alonso leaves the door wide open hoping to cut back to the apex for a better exit and Lawson takes the opportunity. Whether or not he needs to leave him room I'm not sure, but from the onboard there's a chance he's ahead at the apex and doesn't need to, from Ocon's camera it looks like Lawson is ahead. Doesn't look like he weaves on the straight, he moves left at the same time as Alonso, it's just unfortunate that they both went left at the same time, it happens sometimes. Once Alonso has committed to the inside he goes back to the racing line which is fine. Lawson is ahead at the apex and doesn't need to leave any space.\n\nLawson isn't moving under braking lap 5, T11, just showing his hand to Alonso and then moves back to the racing line, braking in a straight line, just cause he doesn't brake parallel to the edge of the track doesn't mean it's moving under braking; Alonso's not in a reasonable position to make a move so it doesn't really matter, nor is he trying to. Lawson is allowed to close the door on him on the exit of 18, he's ahead the whole way round that corner.\n\n'THE incident' Lawson starts moving left before Alonso, Alonso doesn't judge the closing speed well enough and has to get out of it. Lawson moves back to the racing line and leaves Alonso the inside, which he's allowed to do once Alonso has committed to the inside. Alonso goes deep and Lawson gets a pretty good exit towards 13, he's way ahead entering 13 and closes the door, no problems there. Alonso again goes deep due to entering on a shallow line, Ocon goes for a better exit and gets the position.\n\nI know you want your driver to do well, we all do, but if you're going to make a post like this, and don't know the rules, at least position it as your opinion, not objective fact."", 'OP posted the same thing r/sigmaAlonso so take it with a grain of salt!!']",2609,331,2024-10-20 18:28:45, Discussion,96,5

1g7ginn,Why did McLaren tell Norris that Verstappen's tyres would fall off the cliff?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7ginn/why_did_mclaren_tell_norris_that_verstappens/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7ginn/why_did_mclaren_tell_norris_that_verstappens/,2024-10-19,0 days,"Verstappen set the fastest lap of the entire sprint on his very last lap, showing that he certainly had the situation and pace under control and his tyres were in great condition.

McLaren told Lando as early as lap 5, basically 25% into the sprint that Max's tyres were degrading too fast and also on lap 6.

This was obviously wrong information which may have inspired Lando to push more than he should to try and chase Max instead of focussing on keeping the fast Ferraris behind.

McLaren seem to lack the pace this weekend. They should have done what Max did in Singapore. Recognise early that their rival has superior pace and focus on consolidating P2.

Instead they made him believe Max was catchable ( which we now know he wasn't) and made him cook his tyres anf have nothing left to keep Sainz behind and possibly go into tomorrow with s grid penalty too.

Is this another team failure? Thoughts?","['Ruth Buscombe explained this on F1tv \n\nBasically they see max leaning on his rear tires more than Lando. Which is why they told him that. \n\nThey didn‚Äôt actually know if his tires would wear more, but it‚Äôs usually a safe assumption to think that. \n\nBut as we‚Äôve seen in Spa and Monza and from driver complaints, the tires can be very unpredictable this year. Both bad and good', 'Because they thought they were.', ""Cynical answer: McLaren's pitwall just isn't very good.\n\nLess cynical answer: Lando is a driver who needs encouragement, sometimes.\n\nThis is also McLaren's first weekend post-rear wing adjustments and they have a whole pile of upgrades on their car. I don't think the former should have a significant impact on their tyre life, but the latter might."", ""They didn't. They said he was *potentially* damaging his tyres more."", ""I don't think it's going to be grid penalty. And Norris didn't push like hell. His fastest lap is 0.5 sec slower than Max's. It's just McLaren were 3rd fastest car today."", 'It was an assumption based off his sector 2 times.\n\nThey assumed he was using more throttle through the esses and would fall off.\n\nHe did not.', 'I love how people are just making assumptions now cause they want to jump on any little thing and be able to label it a team failure by McLaren.
