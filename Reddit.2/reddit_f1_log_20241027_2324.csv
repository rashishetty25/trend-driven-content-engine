Given Lando's pace at the end, the time loss against Verstappen, and any potential damage, it's not unreasonable to think Norris could have won this race with Verstappen 4th, behind the two Ferraris and Lando.

I appreciate it's not a huge difference, but it makes me wonder if it was part of his mindset going into this race.

Edit: I know we saw similar with Hamilton in 2021 as well. Should this lead to discussions about the time of penalties awarded? Should time penalties be served sooner (like the old 3 laps to serve a stop/go), should you be allowed to change tires at the same time?

By now, there shouldn't be any smidgen of doubt that RB needs to part with Checo Perez.
He is not able to extract any sort of performance from the RB20.
It's getting ridiculous how big the gap has become with Max... and the rest of the field.

Realistically, I think there's only two options: either promote Lawson or Tsunoda to RB.
Tsunoda in that respect is, although talented,  bit erratic in his driving as of late.
Lawson on the other might be the best choice IMO. Of course he's not that experienced yet (so there's always the danger of a Gasly, Kvyat or Albon scenario at RB), but he drives calmly and smart.

A swap with one of them is not an option I think for Perez. That would be an embarrassment, frankly.

What do you think?","[""They can't.\nIf they keep him, Max is 100% not winning the championship.\nThey can't handle 2 competing McLarens and Ferraris with no backup driver support."", ""Maybe Checo can stay because he gets faster, or has Horner's leaked toe photo.\xa0"", 'Ricciardo was binned so Lawson could audition.
