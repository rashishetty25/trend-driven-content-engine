The only viable solution to provide more opportunities for F2 drivers is to expand the number of teams or mandate each team to run three cars, with one designated exclusively for rookies. However, the latter option raises a dilemma: what happens if the rookie proves to be as capable as the two main drivers? Another proposal is to implement stricter licensing requirements, establishing higher standards that drivers must meet to continue racing in F1. Yet, this could be counterproductive, as a driver's performance often hinges on the quality of the car.

Certainly by the second half of the year the difference in performance between Williams and Ferrari was small enough that Schumacher's talent advantage could make up the difference.\n\nWilliams actually had to pause development on their 1998 car to bring upgrades to the FW19 to prevent the title slipping away, which also explains why the 1998 car ended up so undercooked."", ""Yes, he made a few mistakes, but still smashed his team mate. Hyper focusing on mistakes loses the full picture, because despite the mistakes his best performances make up for it. \n\nI think, herein lies the crux of the issue. Villeneuve loses from being compared to Schumacher. Obviously Schumacher was the best driver in 1997 by a clear margin, but that doesn't mean Villeneuve didn't have a strong season himself. I doubt any driver in 1997 would've done better in that Williams apart from Michael himself."", ""Really? I implore you to check out Frentzen's record against his team mates. It's sublime. His only bad seasons relative to his team mates are 1997 and 2001.\n\nOut of all those drivers, I would definitely put Senna, Prost, and Schumacher above Frentzen. The rest are either on par or below.\n\nCoulthard? Not a chance. Doesn't even belong in the conversation."", '94-03 only 2 strong drives has: schumacher and mika. the other drivers before after "" can‚Äôt compete""', ""That's more on Williams than Ferrari to be fair then. Schumacher was the better driver that season.

The line oft repeated is that each position in the championship is worth millions to the teams, however, with the 2026 regulation change looming, and the fact that teams are unable to work on the 2026 cars until the 1st of January 2025, it's made me begin to wonder if finishing 3rd in the WCC might benefit Red Bull in their preparations for the regulation changes.

Each position lost gains a significant extra chunk of wind tunnel runs and CFD time. Is this enough of a benefit for 2026 that it outweighs the financial penalty of finishing further down the table and thus means Sergio's lack of performance is being left unaddressed?
