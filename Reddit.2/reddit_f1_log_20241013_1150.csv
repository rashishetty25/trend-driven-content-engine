What have I seen of Vasseur's Ferrari? What have I seen of Ferrari, he hasn't revolutionised anything'.\n\nMattia Binotto, former Ferrari team principal: ‘I'm taking Audi to F1.

It's the fascination of the challenge'. Mattia Binotto, former Ferrari team principal, in his first interview as head of Audi's F1 programme talks about the excitement of starting again at the age of 54.\n\n**From Maranello to Hinwil, home of Sauber (taken over by Audi). What has he found and what is missing?**\n\n'Two different realities, even the ranking says so. The difference is immense, in everything from size to instruments. But I find so many similarities with the Ferrari of my beginnings, in 1995. A company where everything had to be built or rebuilt. In those days, in addition to reorganising departments and methodology, you had to train people to win. Inculcate the mentality of ‘we are not here to participate’’.\n\n**Why at the age of 54, after having been team principal at Ferrari, did you start again from the bottom?**\n\n‘Precisely because I was starting from a blank sheet of paper. In the 18 months I spent away from racing I missed the competition, being part of a team, sharing fatigue, ambitions and goals. Having the desire to start again, the only attractive challenge for me was Audi, the most ambitious one. It would have made no sense to join a team that already works. Here, instead, I can build, I relive part of my past and that is also why it is fascinating.\n\n**What are the priorities in the Audi programme?**\n\n‘To be in F1 (the official entry will be in 2026 ed.), to stay there for a long time to create a winning team and to become a technical reference. We are at the beginning of the climb, in front is Everest and now we can only see the base. We are deciding which side to climb from, it is important to establish a route'.\n\n**Where does one start?**\n\n‘We have to work on the company itself, on size, on culture. If we compare ourselves with our adversaries we have about 400 people less, we have to add them to be able to compete at the same level. Our choice is to invest in young people'.\n\n**‘Mick Schumacher is an option’.**\n\n**Drivers: taken Hulkenberg, when will you decide on the second?**\n\n‘We can afford the luxury of not being in a hurry, as all the other teams have decided on their line-up. There are two essential aspects: on the one hand, experience to set the path of growth. On the other, a young, talented player to accompany us on the path to the top.\n\n**Is Mick Schumacher an option?**\n\n‘Definitely, we are evaluating him. I've met him and spoken to him, I've known him for a long time having been part of the Ferrari Driver Academy. I know the merits and advantages of him, he's one of the names we have in mind'.\n\n**He has taken Jonathan Wheatley, a pillar of Red Bull. He too is starting from scratch. Why does a team that used to win everything now no longer win and lose such important figures?**\n\n‘Happy with Jonathan's arrival, we have travelled a similar path in different teams. His signing is an important signal, if he came to us it's because he has guarantees. As for Red Bull, well cycles have a beginning and an end, they always have in F1. I think Red Bull is at the end'."", 'Is this the same Binotto that refused to make Leclerc the #1 option in 2022 despite him being the clear superior Ferrari driver?', ""He can have his opinions. I actually agree with most of what he says. But I don't get what he gains from making comments like the ones about Hamilton and Leclerc.\n\nHis management of the team in 2022 was atrocious. He's a brilliant technical mind, but not TP material. I feel like for his sake he should just leave Ferrari in the past and not comment at all. It's not doing him favors to remind people."", ""Binotto needs to just stop talking, he's embarrassed himself enough with how shocking Ferrari was managed when he was in the top spot. \n\nHe's no team principal, he should go back to being an engineer, something he was actually good at.\n\nAudi will be a back marker for his entire tenure, just like it is now.""]",3401,240,2024-10-13 11:50:00,:post-news: News

Aston Martin knew this from the beginning and signed with Honda.

1g2i75w,Prema struggles logic ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g2i75w/prema_struggles_logic/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g2i75w/prema_struggles_logic/,2024-10-13,0 days,"Prema has been regarded as the best F3/F2 team to be in up untill this year. In 2024 Prema  isn't as good and it has been generally accepted opinion that because of Prema struggles their drivers who both got promoted to F1 can't show their true potential. Reasoning behind their promotions is for Antonelli: impressive F4 and FRECA career and beating Bearman. For Bearman is his P3 as a rookie in F3 and P6 as a rookie in F2 last year and his Jeddah stint for now he is 13th in F2 standings.
I have genuine questions about ""Prema is shit argument"".

- Firstly F2 is supposed to have equal cars so weren't people upset with Prema being the best or one of the best team in recent years as it gives some drivers with usually more money an unfair advantage? Like right now some people seem almost annoyed that Prema is not as good as last year. It literally means that their drivers don't have an advantage over others anymore. And imo Prema is still like in top 5 teams.

I must say it but both current Prema drivers has been talked as a 'next F1 stars' and has been fan favourites long before this year. Antonelli's hype as a next Merc driver started after he won F4s and FRECA and Bearman was already reserve driver for Ferrari this year. Also it is not hard to notice that both Kimi and Ollie come from very wealthy families and have connections (especially Kimi's dad). With Prema past reputation I can somewhat see it as a golden ticket in feeder series only for the most priviliged.

- Second question: If we accept ""because of Prema struggles drivers can't show their full  potential"" logic. We should also acknowledge that in the past Prema drivers could look better than they really were but nobody is using this logic in reverse. Bearman accomplished P3 in F3 and P6 in F2 with Prema when they were arguably one of the best teams. Why everybody put all the blame on Prema for Bearman poor performance (plus a bit of bad luck) this year but nobody  acknowleges that he had some team advantage in 2022 and 2023 which could influence his standings?

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/formula1) if you have any questions or concerns.*"", ""Prema drivers generally have high budget. High budget drivers have new chassis and parts whenever they need them, which is always an advantage over drivers with three or more year old chassis cobbled together with repaired parts. (Of course, there are high budget drivers on other teams too.) This year, however, everyone started F2 with a fresh, brand new chassis. So that part is equal. This year in F2 they also couldn't rely on data that the drivers the years before gathered, so it was all on current drivers and current engineers. And Bearman clearly had his head and heart in F1 for the whole year, and F2 was an afterthought. And Antonelli split some of his time too. Driving multiple vehicles is difficult. It really doesn't help when the more experienced driver has quite possibly had an F1 contract all year and known that F2 was a formality for extra track time."", ""Literally everyone who follows the feeder series uses this logic in reverse. Look back at any threads regarding Mick's junior career."", '>I have genuine questions about ""Prema is shit argument"".\n\nIf you look at all of their results in all of the series that they participate in and have participated in, Formula 2 is one of their worst series. Their reputation is built on success in the lower tiers of the support categories. And it\'s not just a 2024 problem, either -- they are wildly inconsistent. Look at their 2019 season, when they finished *ninth* overall. In eight years of Formula 2, they\'ve won the teams\' championship twice and finished second twice. Compare that to six years for Formula 3, where they have won the teams\' championship five times and finished second in the other. Or six years in Formula Regional Europe, where they have five teams\' titles and one third place. Or eleven years of Italian Formula 4, where they have eight teams\' titles and three second places.', ""So because it was a new regulations/car change for f2, some teams got new set ups right immediately and some teams didn't. Just because the cars are more equal does not mean that set up does not matter. Prema got it wrong and it remained wrong for much of the first half of the season and thus their drivers really did not have a shot. Think of it like aston martin that one year where they got it right and were getting podiums and then boom they got it wrong and were suddenly nowhere again. That happens in Motor sport. \n\nIn Ollie's case people give him the benefit of the doubt not only because he has proved not once but twice now that he can succeed in an f1 car but also because he was flat out good last year. He got literally everything you can get in baku last year including pole lap with a broken steering column so his steering wheel wasn't straight. Two things could have happened from last year to this year one he suddenly fell off considerably (which we know is not true from his f1 performances) or two prema fell off hard which is what fans have decided is true and clearly the teams agree to based on his and kimi's promotions. \n\nPrema should have been a team capable of fighting for the championship this year but they aren't they got their act together way to late this year (and in ollie's case it doesn't help for his f2 campaign that he got pulled from two of his best tracks including one of the few early races prema looked decent in and that he had a pole for) making a title run basically impossible so then you judge the drivers based on what they can get out of the car. Its like f1 no one is saying that a williams driver should be regularly winning races the car is just not there so they don't expect it. Prema is a midfield team this year and expectations seem to have been adjusted accordingly.\n\nAs for Ollie taking F2 less seriously, overall pretty much knew from the start of the year he was being promoted. He had 6 FP1s with Haas scheduled BEFORE he got the call up in Jeddah. You don't get 6 FPs announced at a single team and a single team that is NOT your driver academy's team at the very beginning of the year unless you are getting the seat. Then Jeddah happened and I am pretty sure he was told to no longer worry about placing super high in F2...which is fair considering he just had a pole and likely a pretty high finish taken away from him he lost a full weekend of points which with only 14 weekends creates a pretty difficult gap to close AND he just proved he could race in F1 on one of the hardest tracks of the year which honestly is worth more to teams than a good f2 showing because nothing proves you can drive in f1 like driving in f1. So even if it was not announced until his future home race at silverstone Ollie was almost certainly given the handshake that he was getting the seat after Jeddah. And once you have the seat your focus turns to how to best prep for f1 which includes doing your best in fps even if it compromises your f2 races. \n\nTLDR: Either Prema shit the bed this year and thus the results are not representative of the drivers or two very talented drivers forgot how to drive this year and in ollie's case we know the second is not true so it has to be the first and people are acting accordingly. People are judging Ollie off all the info available which includes his f1 stints. Is that unfair to other drivers who didn't get the chance? Maybe but luck already plays a huge role in who gets promoted. You can be super talented but if the right affiliated seat does not appear at the right time your screwed. Like Colapinto and Lawson no one was really singing their praises that they were worthy of getting a seat until they got a shot and proved they were worthy that is just how things go and Ollie probably didn't need that shot based on the number of fp1s he was already scheduled for even before Carlos' appendix decided to bounce."", 'People interpret things the way they want to with their bias. \n\nIf driver they like wins it’s their skill and incredibleness. If driver they like is doing badly it’s the team. \n\nIf driver they like is in a fast car, it’s because of his technical knowledge and set up knowledge helping push the team forward. If a driver they like is in a bad car, it’s because they team  don’t know how to develop or set up their car. \n\nIf a driver they like is rude and loud it’s because he has personality and is a character which is missing from PR drilled drivers these days. If it’s a driver you hate doing the same thing, he’s just rude and disrespectful.', 'Overall I agree apart from Bearman argument that he had his head already in F1 from the beginning of the year. I get his Jeddah stint and FPs with Haas but other than that he had no reasons not to be focused on F2. It could only be remotely possible if he literally had his contract signed after Jeddah or somehow knew he is getting F1 seat no matter the results.

Example - racing a lap in an ordinary car, parking challenge, slalom challenge, reverse a ride-on mower with a trailer attachment, and then finish with a 2 hour endurance go-kart championship in identical equipment. 

What would you like to see in the weekend?

1g28asn,An improvemed points system?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g28asn/an_improvemed_points_system/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g28asn/an_improvemed_points_system/,2024-10-12,0 days,"In modern F1, with reliability so low and the gap between top 4 teams and rest being large. Therefore leading to only 2 spots for points, should they change it so teams like Haas and Williams who found themselves so often just out of the points, being able to get points. Also it would create agurably even better racing as the bottom teams already scrap hard over a p13 imagine if it was for points and how harder they'd scrap. 

My solution: points as usual for the top 4 but rest changes so 
25,18,15,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1
Plus the ability for a driver in top 15 to get fastest lap point.

P.s Also my dream world you'd get a point for pole as well as fastest lap
