1g9dt5h,"With calls for new rule changes after Verstappen's defensive moves, I compiled all the F1 rules changed solely because of Max Verstappen since 2016",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9dt5h/with_calls_for_new_rule_changes_after_verstappens/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9dt5h/with_calls_for_new_rule_changes_after_verstappens/,2024-10-22,0 days,"After the recent controversy surrounding Max Verstappen's defensive driving moves on Lando Norris, I saw a lot of users mention Verstappen being the lead cause of rule changes and forcing the FIA to clarify rules in the past.

I thought it'd be fun to do a deep dive on what changes and clarifications had to be made solely because of him:

*edit: added rule changes 11, 12 and 13, thanks to those who pointed them out!*

*edit: several people requested I make a similar list for Lewis Hamilton. I'll post it tomorrow.*

- - - 

**1. Minimum Age Requirement for F1 Super Licence**

Race: -

Incident: Max Verstappen was signed by Toro Rosso for the 2015 season at just 16 years old, making his F1 debut at 17 years and 166 days—the youngest driver in Formula 1 history.

Rule Change: The FIA introduced new Super Licence requirements effective from the 2016 season. Drivers must be at least 18 years old to be eligible, have accumulated at least 40 points over the previous three seasons in specified lower categories, and have completed a minimum number of kilometers in testing, along with holding a valid road driver's licence.

**2. The ""Verstappen Rule"" – Moving Under Braking**

Race: 2016 Japanese Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen aggressively defended against Lewis Hamilton by moving under braking into the chicane, forcing Hamilton to take evasive action.

Rule Change: The FIA prohibited drivers from changing direction under braking in a way that could cause an avoidable collision. Drivers must not move unpredictably or change direction under braking when defending, and must leave at least one car's width between their own car and the edge of the track when defending.

**3. Expansion of the ""Verstappen Rule"" – Dangerous Defensive Maneuvers**

Race: 2016 Belgian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen made aggressive defensive moves against Kimi Räikkönen, including moving under braking and weaving on straights, leading to safety concerns.

Rule Change: The FIA expanded the rule to penalize any dangerous defensive maneuvers. Drivers are not allowed to make more than one change of direction to defend a position. Any movement that impedes another driver in a dangerous manner is prohibited, and stewards were given increased authority to penalize unsportsmanlike conduct.

**4. Use of Alternate Lines and Track Limits**

Race: 2017 United States Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen overtook Kimi Räikkönen for third place on the final lap by going off-track and cutting inside the track limits at Turn 17.

Rule Clarification: The FIA provided clarifying definitions of track limits and enforced consistent penalties. The track is defined by the white lines; drivers must keep at least one wheel within these lines at all times. Overtaking or gaining a lasting advantage by leaving the track is prohibited. Stewards were instructed to apply penalties uniformly for track limit violations.

**5. Driver Conduct and Physical Altercations**

Race: 2018 Brazilian Grand Prix

Incident: After a collision with Esteban Ocon, Verstappen confronted and physically pushed Ocon multiple times in the FIA weigh-in area.

Rule Change: The FIA strengthened regulations against unsportsmanlike conduct off the track. Drivers must conduct themselves professionally and with respect. Physical altercations can result in penalties such as community service, fines, or suspension, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the sport's integrity.

**6. Formation Lap Overtaking Clarification**

Race: 2021 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton during the formation lap before the race start.

Rule Clarification: The FIA clarified rules regarding formation lap conduct. Drivers must maintain their grid positions during the formation lap unless a car is delayed leaving the grid. Overtaking is only permitted if a car is delayed and others cannot avoid passing it without unduly delaying the remainder of the field. Procedures were clarified to ensure all drivers understand acceptable behavior before the race start.

**7. Clarification on Forcing a Driver Off-Track**

Race: 2021 Brazilian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen defended his position by pushing Lewis Hamilton wide at Turn 4, causing both cars to leave the track.

Rule Clarification: The FIA issued clearer guidelines on overtaking and defending. If an overtaking car is significantly alongside, the defending driver must leave at least one car's width of space. Drivers must not deliberately force another driver off the track. Detailed criteria were provided for stewards to assess incidents consistently.

**8. Technical Regulations on Rear Wings and Parc Fermé**

Race: 2021 Brazilian Grand Prix

Incident: After qualifying, Verstappen touched and inspected Hamilton's rear wing in parc fermé conditions.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced rules regarding parc fermé conditions. Drivers and team personnel are prohibited from touching or examining rival cars during parc fermé. Strict penalties, including fines and sporting penalties, can be applied for violations. Security measures were enhanced, with increased monitoring and enforcement.

**9. Double Yellow Flag Compliance**

Race: 2021 Qatar Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen failed to sufficiently slow down for double-waved yellow flags during qualifying.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced the importance of yellow flag compliance. Stricter penalties were introduced for Verstappen's failing to respect yellow flags.

**10. Brake Testing and Sudden Deceleration**

Race: 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen braked suddenly in front of Hamilton while attempting to let him pass, leading to a collision.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced rules against dangerous driving behaviors. Sudden deceleration or ""brake testing"" that endangers other drivers is strictly prohibited. Procedures for safely yielding positions were clarified, including proper communication protocols between teams and race control. Stricter penalties were introduced to deter such actions.

**11. Restrictions on Post-Race Celebrations and dangerous driving over the Finish Line**
 
(*edit - suggested by /u/SomewhereAlarmed9985)*

Race: 2021 Styrian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen slowed down and performed burnouts or drifted over the finish line to celebrate his victory, which was deemed potentially dangerous.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced regulations prohibiting dangerous driving after the chequered flag, including burnouts and drifting over the finish line. Drivers are required to proceed safely to parc fermé after finishing the race. Post-race celebrations must not endanger other drivers, marshals, or spectators.

**12. Safety Car Restart Procedure Change**

Race: 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen often drew alongside the car ahead during safety car restarts, notably during the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix where he pulled alongside Lewis Hamilton before the restart.

Rule Change: The FIA updated the safety car restart procedures:
Drivers must remain in a single line without overlapping until the race resumes.
Overtaking or drawing alongside another car before crossing the start/finish line after the safety car has pulled into the pits is prohibited.
Drivers cannot gain an advantage by positioning themselves alongside the car ahead during a restart.


**13. Clarification of Pitlane Exit Rules**

(*edit- suggested by user /u/Buffythedragonslayer)

Race: 2023 Monaco Grand Prix

Incident: During the race, Max Verstappen appeared to cross the pit exit line when rejoining the track, leading to controversy over whether he violated the rules.

Rule Clarification: The FIA tweaked the pitlane exit rules to clarify that drivers must not cross any part of their car over the pit exit line when rejoining the track. The updated rule specifies that touching or crossing the line with any part of the car constitutes a violation.

They have a turning circle of a boat in the slower corners.', 'People will obviously say “oh people want a rule change because it’s Max” but really it shouldn’t be in the rules to begin with that you can push both cars off track and get the other guy penalized.', ""the biggest issue to me is it makes the sport look silly, backwater, and like they don't know what they are doing. While some or all of those may be true at times. Its another things to actively give the people who believe that ammunition. \n\n  \nMy wife was a casual observer of the race and even she was confused on exactly why Lando was penalized. Esepcially in the context of me explaining to her why George Russell was penalized with Bottas earlier. \n\nIt just makes it so anyone who isn't in the thick of this sport to feel like there are no rules and everything has a degree of fixing to make sure certain players do well which isn't true but the optics are everything sometimes.  Especially when you are trying to reach new people, just not appease people who are already invested."", ""The defending car should never be allowed to push the attacker off track when they don't make the corner themselves. It is stupid in every angle. It ruins championship fights, because the one in the lead can simply drive like it's bumper cars, since they will still have the upper hand if both of them crash out of the race. We saw this to the extreme in Brazil 21 and after, where Lewis had to actively dodge Max every single time or they'd both crash because Max was given zero reason to care by the rules. That in itself is a massive flaw in the rulebook, it needs action ASAP.\n\nI want to watch skillful fights within the track limits. Not bumper cars straight out of F1 videogame online lobbies."", 'He’s right.\n\nThe idea of motor racing is that you drive as fast as possible within the confines of the track and without hitting the other cars. \n\nMax’s move essentially allows him to redraw the track to prevent an overtake. That is against the very fabric of the sport. \n\nDoing it in wheel to wheel racing is clearly a different kettle of fish to doing it on a flying lap as it created a situation for Lando to choose between crashing into Max or leaving the track.\n\nThat’s the reason it caused such an uproar in Brazil 2021 and such an uproar here (as well as the context of it happening in a championship battle). \n\nI just can’t see why anyone would want a rule that ENCOURAGES drivers to leave the track without consequence', ""1. Lando was wrong to overtake off the track. That is a penalty unless the position is given back. No problems here.\n\n2. Max was wrong to defend his position off track. Making it impossible to him to make the corner and even allowing Lando to make the corner. Max arrived out of control seem as he also left the track, which again is against the rules. That should have applied to a penalty here. \n\n3. Rules need to amended to stop what Max did. Drivers should be able to defend the entire track if they can stay on the track. If there is a wall or gravel trap, then Max wouldn't have done what he did as he would have crashed. \n\n4.

It's interesting. He's pretty detail-oriented. Sometimes you have to help him a little bit to understand what he's feeling and put it into words, but I think he's not too different from Alex (Albon). He's understanding very well and being very sensitive to the car itself, which is very helpful, and even in the simulator, which is very different to the race car, he's always quite detailed and can give us good direction and understand what the limitations are.”\n\n“He loves to talk. You probably see him in interviews. I've been pushing him to try to be concise in his comments. And it's funny, sometimes he gets carried away. I think that's the Latin philosophy, the way you live. You just express yourself a lot. It's very different from what you see in countries like England, where people are more straight to the point. It's very interesting,” he said.\n\nThe French engineer recalled what happened when he first worked with Colapinto in the simulator that the Williams team has at its Grove factory.\n\n“It's something we worked a lot at the beginning, in the simulator sessions. The first time he made a start and stopped, I think I ran out of space to write down his comments. He's more concise (now), he can still work on it,” he said with a chuckle.\n\nJego explained why it is important for Colapinto, or for that matter any Formula 1 driver, to be precise when describing what he feels with the single-seater upon returning to the garage.\n\n“When you do short starts, even in practice, the moments (to talk) are never really long. Maybe you have 90 seconds, two minutes with the driver for a quick chat. Then it needs to be really effective. And I think he's fine with that now.”\n\n“I think it's a good exercise, because if you're able to give feedback that's concise, that means it's also clear in your head. It's getting better, it's getting better. With you (the media), I don't know, maybe the heart speaks more than the head,” he finished.\n\n\n\nTranslated with [DeepL.com](http://DeepL.com) (free version)"", 'Love how the ""talk less"" is nothing to do with his interviews or anything media related.\n\nYet most of the comments are exactly that 😂', ""Did the writer purposefully word the title to be a bit 'clickbaity?

Teams spend too much money on protection then complain about lack of R&D.

It’s just embarrassing to see Perez driving the way he has,  there’s no arguing that he is the worst performing driver on the grid bar Zhou and that’s a maybe, because we don’t really know how terrible is the Sauber.

The only logical reason to Checo keeping his seat is that RBR wants as much as CFD and Wind Tunnel it can get to work on the 26 car. Having a terrible underperforming driver on the second seat is a sure fire way to do this without getting the risk of being punished.

Im not saying that it was the intent all along, but things have drastically changed for Red Bull in and out of the track, it was an opportunity that presented itself and they jumped on it.

They are in turmoil, lost key personnel, there’s looming and increasing chance that Max leaves and they lost their huge advantage on track.

And it’s pretty obvious to anyone that whom ever gets the new regulations right have at the least a few years of dominance. Right now RBR needs every once of help it can get.

I’m certain that if things kept the same way as last year, Checo would be gone on the summer break.

I really get that Daniel wasn’t lighting the world on fire and I also understand it was time for him to give room for the new generation, but he most certainly deserved a proper send off. A lot more than Checo does.

In a fair world, Checo would be gone after the break, Daniel would have his last races in the first team and give room to Lawson in 25 with Iwasa/Hadjar joining RB.

But alas…","[""TLDR: This guy thinks washed Perez should have been replaced by washed DR.

You put a new driver and give him a car that keeps changing, he’s not gonna perform. Based on the current available drivers, and the balance between the money Checo brings, they decided to keep Checo. He has been ass, but it’s not fair to compare him with Max. Max manages to get the best of out of the car even if it’s not good. There were races where RB had a straight line speed in the bottom 3. Checo definitely is way past his best performances, but there’s just no other available option performing better than him post the break this season.', "">The only logical reason to Checo keeping his seat is that RBR wants as much as CFD and Wind Tunnel it can get to work on the 26 car.
