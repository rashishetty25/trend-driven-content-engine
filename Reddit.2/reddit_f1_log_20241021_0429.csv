1g87bbt,What’s with the overtaking rules? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g87bbt/whats_with_the_overtaking_rules/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g87bbt/whats_with_the_overtaking_rules/,2024-10-20,0 days,"So after Russell’s penalty this got me thinking - in any other type of motorsport that’s a penalty - he did force him off the track and to be honest I agree with it.

*But* that penalty was inconsistent to what we’ve seen recently - most notably t1 with Norris and Verstappen. So, for the purpose of this post let’s ignore Russel’s penalty as that’s another whole discussion.  

If the rules for the most part are that you can get away with that then why is that the case?
You can just go into a corner and escort your opponent wide? What’s with that? - we will never see any interesting racing.

Especially when the driver that’s been pushed off can’t even fight back because they’ll get a penalty for “keeping the position by going off track” when they had nowhere else to go. 

If it were up to me you’d have to leave a cars width to the car on the outside, when overtaking and defending, as is the rules in most other respects of motorsport afaik. 

Am I alone in thinking this?

It should not have taken Lando that long to make a significant move. 

- Lando initially caught him at a rate of knots showing the pace of the car
- Lando had fresher tyres
- Had DRS at a track where DRS is very powerful and the track is very wide so many overtaking opportunities 
- Was consistently using more battery than Max despite the DRS and all around faster car 
- Did the exact same thing at the exact same place for 8 laps 
- Max had a lock up and still managed to get the gap back

I thought he was measured and didn’t rush like he did before, and max put his car into the right spots to hold on. \n\nAlso in sector 1 that red bull was fucking planted. \n\nAs for passing max in future, he NEEDS to chop across him to cover him.

He knew he could build margin going into the esses so he wasn't concerned with Lando being in his gearbox there, and he also knew he needs margin going onto the long back straigt, so he prioritized the exit of the corner leading onto it. Every time he got it just about right enough that Lando came up a car length short. \n\nA lot has been said and will be said about Max's wheel-to-wheel racing, but he's so annoyingly good at defending even the opportunity for an overtake.

This is an admittedly small sample size.

Median qualifying pace difference is 0.156% in favor of Colapinto in my calculation.

My hot take is that while Albon's race management has improved, his outright pace hasn't changed much since leaving Red Bull. Obviously, he destroyed Latifi and Sargeant but looking back those are very low bars to cross.

If he was put back in the Red Bull, I'm not sure he'd perform much different from his performance in 2020 vs Max or current Checo. On the other hand, maybe he has improved and Colapinto is just a quicker and better driver than I'm giving him credit for.

I'm curious to see how this develops over the last few races and also in light of the 2025 Williams lineup.","['I fully support Franco. Does he deserve a seat in another team? In my opinion, yes. However, why don’t we wait until Abu Dhabi to draw some conclusions? Franco came in strong without pressure. He has nothing to lose and Alex had both a few unfortunate situations and also is under pressure for the first time. The next couple of races could be a complete different story and our conclusions are left in the dust. Franco is competitive but that doesn’t make Alex overrated. Maybe Franco is really good? Maybe Alex had 2 bad races only? Too early to tell.', ""Colapinto has been outstanding, but I think people are writing Albon off based on little real evidence because F1 fans tend to take any possible opportunity to beat down on someone without really taking into account the contexts of why they've not been getting results.\n\nBoth of the times Colapinto has outqualified Albon have in large part been down to Albon making errors or otherwise having problems. In Azerbaijan for example Albon had the fan issue in Q3 which meant he couldn't do a final run, while in sprint quali here he obviously had the spin. That's not to discount what Franco has done because he's been very close regardless, and in the case of Austin SQ he should be applauded for *not* making an error.  They do however provide some much needed context behind Albon's losses to Franco (also I'm not sure where you're getting 2-2. It's 3-2 to Albon across the 5 quali sessions they've completed together)\n\nLikewise in the race, Albon got twatted into at T1 here which damaged his car, so I wouldn't read too much into that, and in Singapore he had car issues too which ultimately led to his retirement.\n\nColapinto is doing fantastically and I hope to see him in a Williams long-term in the not-too-distant future as a fan of the team, but Albon doesn't have to be discredited in order to recognise the brilliant showing that Colapinto is putting in."", ""Albon will get his chance next year to prove his actual pace.\n\nCarlos Sainz turns out to be a quite handy measuring stick for driver performance. He was outscored by a very young Max Verstappen (young but someone who would win a race for RBR the following year and look generally pretty good), beat a young Norris in 2 seasons (the second one much closer) and has been very close to Leclerc in Ferrari. In essence, we know he is pretty good, and he was never the focus of any of the teams he drove for.\n\nIf Albon can beat him handily, especially towards the end of the year, that would be a pretty good evidence that he (and Colapinto) are very good. If Sainz dominates, we'll know that Albon was flattered by poor teammates."", 'I mean one of the races Albon had an ice box in this car for the last quali run and then DNF’d due to mechanical issues…\n\nBut, I think Colapinto is quick. I think they’re both getting basically all you can out of the car, where previously it was only Albon doing that. Albon’s last 2 races have been kind of ruined by some bad luck, where Colapinto has come out on the good side of some midfield scuffles. I think it shows that Albon isn’t a miracle worker, just getting the results the car was capable of.\n\nIf I were Albon, I’d be a bit nervous about what this means for my future long term, as I could see Williams being tempted by the fanatical backing that Colapinto brings if Albon gets thoroughly out performed next year. I think Albon can prove himself, but only time will tell.', 'I’m prepared to give Albon the benefit of the doubt at the moment and reserve judgement until we see him against Carlos next season', 'Alex got damage on turn 1 which nuked his race, but sure lets compare apples to oranges.', ""Colapinto is great and I'm not even opposed to rating Colapinto higher since summer break, but didn't Albon have damage from Lap 1 at?

](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/doc_2_-_2022_imola_event_-_fia_f1_driving_standard_guidelines.pdf)

Apparently there is a more recent version but not publicly available. Key point is 


Guidelines for overtaking on the outside of a corner:


- In order for a car being overtaken to be required to give sufficient room to an overtaking car, the
overtaking car needs to have a significant portion of the car alongside the car being overtaken and
the overtaking manoeuvre must be done in a safe and controlled manner, while enabling the car to
clearly remain within the limits of the track.

- When considering what is a ‘significant portion’, for an overtaking on the outside of a corner, among
the various factors that will be looked at by the stewards when exercising their discretion, the
stewards will consider if the overtaking car is ahead of the other car from the apex of the corner.

- The car being overtaken must be capable of making the corner while remaining within the limits of
the track.


So Lando wasn't ahead at the apex hence wasn't entitled to room. However, the last point says that Max must be capable of making the corner as well. So IMO they are both in the wrong (or call it a racing incident). Thoughts?

EDIT: obviously these are 'guidelines' only but you would hope stewards would attempt to follow them for consistency","['The ""among the various factors the stewards will consider"" part is clear as fucking mud.\n\nI mean obviously they don\'t think being ahead at the apex is the only factor, or they\'d just say that, but instead they seem to be calling that out as the main factor but not the only one. As a result I can see why Lando\'s so pissed, if the only thing that matters is being ahead at the apex, just say that.', 'As an aside it was always stupid to tie the rules to the apex, should be the start of the braking zone', ""Both did something wrong (leaving the track).\n\nI assume the stewards saw wrongdoing from both Verstappen and Norris because both were too fast for the corner, kind of offsetting each other.\n\nThat doesn't mean Norris is allowed to overtake off track though."", 'It would have been a racing incident if Lando had not gained a position. He did, and therefore, penalty.', "">So IMO they are both in the wrong (or call it a racing incident).\n\nYou are correct, they're both in the wrong for leaving the track, so it offsets, racing incident. \n\nWhile off track, Lando then passed Max, causing the penalty."", 'Agreed. Either both penalties or , what it should be classed as, good hard racing.', 'Broken link', 'Both wrong, but one more wrong basically (by way of how far off the track he went) + Being behind at the Apex + Gaining a lasting advantage at the end of it all. \n\n  \nThats 3 reasons all of which in my opinion make it an easy Slam Dunk penalty.', 'However you feel about it being fair or not, the only thing max did wrong on that corner was he himself running off track too, however that is irrelevant according to the rules, and only got him 1x track limit strike, since he ""gained no advantage"". Lando however gained an advantage and overtook off track, the rule is clear as day. It is frustrating, but the stewards only gave him a 5sec and they did not count that offtrack as a violation which would have got him a penalty anyway later on.']",29,68,2024-10-21 04:28:55, Discussion,2,0

As for overtaking on the outside of a corner, the guidelines acknowledge that it is a more difficult move to pull off.

For a long time drivers have been taught from karting all the way through the racing pyramid that if you try to hang it round the outside, you are at risk of running out of road.

It’s often been left up to how hard certain drivers race. ‘Fairer’ drivers will leave a bit of room for their rivals, more ruthless drivers will edge them out.

But in recent years there has been a clear effort to define when it’s essential for a driver to leave space, and that’s the case in the new guidelines as well.

So, for a driver to be given room when overtaking on the outside, including at the exit of the corner, the overtaking car must:

-Have the front axle AT LEAST ALONGSIDE the front axle of the other car at the apex of the corner AND to the exit
-Be driven in a safe and controlled manner throughout the manoeuvre (entry, apex and exit)
-Be able to make the corner within the track limits

In a lot of cases this is going to leave a driver at the mercy of their rival or the laws of physics as cars on the inside wash out.

This isn’t intended to stop an optimistic pass, it just means drivers have to accept the risks involved. It is quite close to being a codified ‘live by the sword, die by the sword’ rule. ","['>\t— Be driven in a safe and controlled manner throughout the manoeuvre (entry, apex and exit)\n\n>\t— Be able to make the corner within the track limits\n\nabout that….', 'I feel like ahead at the apex loses all meaning when Max is only ahead at the apex because he has no intention of keeping the car on track.', 'Sorry for the odd formatting… doing from my phone!', 'Is Lando even considered the overtaker, if he is ahead prior to the braking zones?', 'But those rules apply to the overtaker, not the defender.

1g89hcn,Why does forcing another driver off the track makes a difference if you are attacker or defender?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g89hcn/why_does_forcing_another_driver_off_the_track/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g89hcn/why_does_forcing_another_driver_off_the_track/,2024-10-20,0 days,"How does this makes any sense in the context of Yuki, George and I think it was Piere getting all a 5 second penalty for forcing a driver off the track and Max not getting a penalty even though he did the exact same but was a defender instead of attacker?

All the talk about stewarding decisions taking the action and not the consequences into consideration is again bullshit as its not happening.

Why do not give Max a 5 sec penalty?. Would be just fair and consistend as Max was definitely in the wrong doing the same stuff as 3 other drivers that got a penalty.

1g8cbjh,It's all about the braking zone.,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8cbjh/its_all_about_the_braking_zone/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8cbjh/its_all_about_the_braking_zone/,2024-10-20,0 days,"There's a reason why everyone is up in arms about the Russell/Bottas Verstappen/Norris stuff, and it's because of the FIAs implementation of the rules.

 &nbsp;

It should not be about who's ahead at the apex, but whether the drivers -whether overtaking or defending- deserve space, and that should be determined by where they are going into the braking zone.

 &nbsp;

If the defending driver is on the inside, then they shouldn't be allowed to brake too deep -therefore getting to the apex sooner... ya know... because they didn't actually try to stop the car- and run themselves and the overtaking driver (on the outside) off track.

 

Time and time again we see the overtaking driver (on the outside) getting alongside/ahead of the defending driver before the braking zone, but then getting outbraked (and by outbraked I mean the inside line defending driver doesnt try to stay on track) and the FIA says ""oh its fair because of the apex rule""... But this completely ignores the contextual information BEFORE they start braking.

 &nbsp;

This is especially annoying because the FIA said they were going to implement a new rule for the 2022 season that required the defending driver (on the inside) to give space to the overtaking driver (on the outside), as long the the overtaking driver's front wheels were even/ahead of the defending driver's rear wheels at the apex.
