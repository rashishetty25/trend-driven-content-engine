I wouldnt be surprised if they added some idiotic wording that makes us start all over again.', 'Wolff: Verstappen penalties will change the way everybody races in F1\n\nVerstappen: hold my disgusting energy drink', ""I'm sure everybody will take into account the penalties when racing, but as stated by many: it's the lack of consistency when applying the rules that is the problem. Even looking at the USA GP and Mex GP: multiple drivers we're penalized for forcing a driver off track or leaving the track and gaining an advantage, but at COTA all penalties were 5 sec. Now, Max got 10 sec (while I don't dissagree with the severity, it is inconsistent). Even within the Mexico GP: Max got 10 seconds for forcing Lando off track in Turn 4, being the defending car, whereas Perez got nothing for basically doing the same to Lawson as the overtaking car in the same corner.\n\nThat said, as for Max specifically: He is just smart. He simply knows how to use the rules to his advantage, even if that means making a 'smart foul'. Sportmanslike? Maybe not. But as long as it benefits him in terms of results (or it doesn't really hurt him in the worst case scenario), I think he will continu to exploit the regulations where it indeed is beneficial to him. And others at some point will follow his lead. You already saw drivers racing to the apex as they noticed Max did it effectively and gained an advantage by just racing to the apex.\n\nUnless this is more structurally adressed in a way where these 'fouls' do not result in a benefit (which can never be completely eliminated, but could be addressed better than this), I doubt things will change very much.\n\nI also think the penalty point race ban is pretty useless. With the exception of Magnussen (who really took the piss with the regulations on some occasions), this has never been applied. Perhaps a better approach could be to penalize repeat offenders more harshly. Forcing a driver off track? 5 seconds penalty. Do it again next week? 10 seconds. Third time? Drive through. This way you leave open the possibility of people making unintential mistakes and not having to penalize them hard, but you can impose more harsh penalties to those trying to use the regulations including limited penalties to their advantage.\n\nI also still think grid penalties should be a thing. Too often we have seen a penalized driver taking advantage of their penalty (or at least not being hurt by it) due to simply having a faster car that allowed them to open enough of a gap so the penalty won't affect the race result. Examples are Lewis at Silverstone 2021 and Max at Vegas 2023. (An example the other way around is Carlos in Australia 2023, where he got a 5 second penalty but with the safety car going to the finishline, he finished the race in P4, but with the penalty applied he dropped all the way to p12 as there was simply a que of drivers right behind him due to the safety car.)"", ""Basically saying, more than half the grid has raced like this the past years.

It's all hyperbole."", 'No. They won’t.

1gesh8a,The impact of teammates on the championship - a third of Max’s lead is down to teammate impact ,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gesh8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gesh8a/the_impact_of_teammates_on_the_championship_a/,2024-10-29,0 days,"I decided to work out how much impact Perez and Piastri have had on the WDC by taking points from their teammates and their teammates’ rivals.

It was quite striking that Max has benefited a lot more from this. Perez took 7 points off Lando early in the season, thanks to the sheer dominance of the Red Bull, the extent of which we’ve not seen replicated by McLaren later in the season. 

Oscar’s impact is the more interesting one. He’s pretty much only taken points off Max when he’s also taken points from Lando. He’s actually been a detriment to Lando. This is surprising as you would expect the McLaren to be able to deliver 1-2’s. I attribute this to a few no show weekends from Oscar leading to missed opportunities (Zandvoort, Singapore and Mexico) and Lando not having the same dominance over his teammate as Max. 

I still think we could see this trend start to reverse in the run-in. When you look at the McL’s dominance over Red Bull since summer break (notwithstanding Austin weekend), then there should be potential for Oscar to slot in between Max and Lando, also noting that McL have indicated they will use team orders.

Hope you find that interesting and welcome any thoughts ","['Arguably this kinda highlights the reasons why max will win the WDC and why McLaren will win the WCC (Sergio took no points off max, mostly due to spending most of his time racing haas and VCARB; McLaren on the other hand lost out on WDC points, but have (for the most part) 2 drivers instead of 1)', 'Sergio points from Max: 0', ""Just to add to the analysis though: in the case of McLaren, the other variables. It is not enough just to have a second car that could potentially finish up and down the grid, the team has to enable that, which McLaren has been uniquely very poor at doing. I'd love to know what Oscar could have done position-wise if the team was able to execute double-stack pit stops, etc. McLaren was resolute in not coordinating strategies to benefit Lando but could have positioned both better (read: ahead of Max) with a more thoughtful approach. And of course a better start to the season would have made a difference too: if a team is intent on not having a number one driver, they cannot let that driver start the year flat footed compared to the competition. I'm of the belief that the team itself handicapped Lando's WDC effort more than any other factor, and is kind of a confounding variable in your graphs."", 'It would be interesting to add Leclerc to this.', ""Perez didn't take points off Max but he could/should have taken more off Lando"", 'Funnily enough Oscar has been out there to race all season, that involves beating Lando. \n\nI’m not sure what point that is trying to make.', 'Perez was alive for the first few races.

It's all there, and ready. \n\nthis all has been designed. matter of fact, the parts in brazil should/are vastly different to that of let's say spain, because of development. \n\nmeaning, the spain car is 'outdated' and can't be used anymore. this means that almost every race, a car is a disposable item anyway.\n\nthey have to MAKE the parts anyway, and they have to have spare parts ANYWAY.\n\nthe machines you need for the parts you need to have anyway. it's not like they now need to order a new 500k CNC machine. \n\nIn all fairness, wrecking a car makes it theoretically more efficient, as the spares are gone, now you have to use the last drop of what you made. if the next race you were going to introduce new parts anyway, then the old parts were to be 'thrown away'. or put into a museum at best. \n\nthe cost of making parts obviously is not zero, but again, the spare parts were made already. so, it's not like they had to 'order new parts' from a supplier, and they make it in-house. \n\nat best, you have over hours on your mechanics, which will have to be paid more. but relatively, that's minimal on an entire f1 budget. \n\nyes, obviously it costs money. but the whole image painted by the teams is nonsense. the only relative loss is the material cost if you have to make new ones or bring spares overnight, and mechanic costs. The bigger loss might be that you now have less data on your parts, and the driver less experience, meaning your development is compromised, and that MIGHT, just MIGHT mean your car might drop in the standings. \n\nHowever, there is no way that Mercedes is going to drop below Aston, and they're not gonna pass RBR either. So in the WCC standings and thus prize money, it won't make a difference either. \n\nF1 is a prototype series, which makes it vastly different to a GP3 cup series for example. If you run a private team, in a cup car series for example, and you buy a F.E. a Lamborghini, and you buy all the parts, and you don't actually make them yourself, or design it yourself, then yes, if you wreck a car, that's gonna be costly, because you now need to order/buy new parts. (Even though, you're supposed to have spares anyway still.)\n\nF1 teams are trying to act like they are a cup series, like they are buying lamborghini's, or bugatti's. they don't. perhaps to a degree you could say this about a team like Haas, whom buys parts from Ferrari for example, and when parts get wrecked, they need to order new parts from them as they can't make it themselves. But that has been calculated in by their accountants, which is why they buy the parts and don't manufacture them. Interestingly enough, this also lowers the costs for Ferrari as they get to make parts not only for them, but also sell them to other teams. VCARB is a good example here if they use RBR parts from the year before. \n\nSo to be honest, they're really throwing a lot of nonsense out."", 'Sargeant is still the champ.', ""But then where do you draw the line? if new parts are allowed to be produced without impacting the cost cap. Won't drivers and teams just crash the car with the old bits so they can make new parts consequence free?"", 'Midfield teams are the reason why we have cost caps.

1gextdp,Ferrari is the anti-McLaren: here is the Prancing Horse's extra weapon,https://formu1a.uno/it/ferrari-e-lanti-mclaren-ecco-larma-in-piu-del-cavallino/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gextdp/ferrari_is_the_antimclaren_here_is_the_prancing/,2024-10-29,0 days,,"[""> here is the Prancing Horse's extra weapon\n\nIt's called Max Verstappen, since he'll go to any lengths including compromising his own race in order to make sure Norris doesn't win."", ""Translation \n\n\nIt hasn't happened since 2022 with the F1-75 that Ferrari won two races in a row. In Mexico Carlos Sainz did what his teammate had managed a week earlier in Austin. A decisive and deserved victory for the driver from Madrid, who had also taken an always complicated pole position for Ferrari, in a weekend certainly with fewer hitches than Leclerc. Lando Norris got between the two reds, taking away the chance for the Prancing Horse to repeat the one-two. However, a first and a third position remain that have an important weight in the Constructors' Championship.\n\n\nFerrari is now second in the Constructors and is the real anti-McLaren. The consistency of Leclerc and Sainz could be the extra weapon.\n\nThe SF-24 is now the real rival of the English team leading the constructors' championship, with Red Bull completely disappeared and, by Max Verstappen's own admission, never really fighting in recent weeks for the most coveted championship for most of the team owners. Ferrari's recovery could be considered sensational given that in two weekends, the Leclerc-Sainz duo has recovered 46 points on McLaren, now moving into second place at -29 points with four GPs to go. Enrico Cardile's former car has been put back on the right track with the update packages introduced in Monza and Singapore, confirming overseas that the steps forward made are to be considered more than important .\n\n\nIs Ferrari now the best car overall? In Maranello they don't want to hear about it, also because there is the certainty that the Mexican GP would have been much more complicated to win without the important skirmishes between Verstappen and Norris. The latter in fact showed the best race pace after the switch to hard tyres and a certain drop in asphalt temperature while he was certainly slowed down by Max Verstappen in the first part of the race, where Ferrari managed to open up the gap that guaranteed him the victory with Sainz.\n\n\nThe English McLaren driver used the new bottom all weekend, which was not a given at least at the start of the weekend, a sign that the important improvements expected by the Woking team were seen on track in FP2. For his part, Leclerc had to manage a lot, with a continuous lift-and-coast that prevented him from keeping the pace of the Madrid driver also due to the difficulty of keeping the tyres in the optimal window. It should also be underlined that having skipped FP1 and not having been able to work significantly on the set-ups in FP2 , due to the hour and a half dedicated mainly to testing the Pirelli tyres, did not help the Monegasque driver . A Leclerc who already in Austin had adapted more slowly to the new balance generated by a much more flexible front wing than the specification that had debuted in Singapore , and only with the setup changes between the Sprint and Main Race had he found that little something extra that had allowed him to dominate on the American Sunday. In Mexico, the time available was very short for the Monegasque, who entered qualifying almost in the dark regarding the set-up, so much so that he did not perform as well as his teammate.\n\n\nMexico has put to rest any doubts about the progress of SF-24, but will Interlagos close the circle?\n\nNow Ferrari is clearly the anti-McLaren and the gap from the top, after the latest evolutions brought to the SF-24, in certain phases and technical areas seems to have almost disappeared. And so the consistency of the Leclerc-Sainz duo could be the extra weapon in an unexpected, at least until a few weeks ago, chase for the constructors, which has been missing from Maranello since the distant 2008. If the car is able to compete for the victory, it seems more likely that there will be at least two drivers dressed in red on the podium than dressed in orange and this could be a significant advantage. An aspect in which McLaren – with the little experience of Piastri and an alternating current Lando Norris – and Red Bull – with a Perez in free fall – are lacking compared to the red driver lineup.\n\n\nAt Interlagos it is very likely that we will see both McLarens equipped with the latest updates, and not just Lando Norris' MCL38, also to try to respond to the hard attack by Ferrari in the last two events. The Brazilian track will close the triptych of consecutive races that began in Austin, and is quite complete given that there are slow sections and also long and medium and high speed support corners, as well as weather that is still to be evaluated, especially for the Sunday race. Red Bull and Max Verstappen left Mexico with very few positives, except for the few points lost by the Dutchman against Norris. However, the RB20 still lacks a lot technically compared to Ferrari and McLaren even after the developments brought to Texas, which have improved the English car in terms of connection between the front and rear axle but have not significantly widened the operating window. This is why we see Max Verstappen constantly racing in defense, clinging to even incorrect maneuvers to ruin his rival's race, favoring in a certain way Ferrari, a clear ally of the three-time world champion. For their part, in Maranello they know they still have a chance in Brazil to give continuity to the best technical moment of the season for the SF-24, with only the Qatar layout that 'scaries'. No updates are planned for Ferrari , with the men from Maranello who will continue to work to extract the maximum from the SF-24, in what will once again be a weekend with the Sprint Race."", "">here is the Prancing Horse's extra weapon\n\nDU DU DU DU"", 'The answer is Max Verstappen', 'McLaren just needs to make the DELL logo a bit bigger and the championship is secured.', ""They've been so impressive the last couple races, just got on with it, no weird strategies or anything"", 'Off the remaining races, I only see Ferrari winning Las Vegas; otherwise, I guess if even one of the cars is on the podium would be great.', 'Few manufacturer rivalries have been as strong for so long as that one between Ferrari and McLaren.', 'Ferrari simply cannot accept McLaren being title favourites.

F1 spending: stop or continue?
In the midst of all this, of course, the relevance of the Audi F1 project seems very strange. With the economic situation of the Volkswagen group having deteriorated over the last two years, the arrival of the brand with the rings in Formula 1 is once again weakened. Audi has nevertheless done everything to ensure its arrival in 2026, in particular with the 100% acquisition of the Sauber group at the beginning of the year . Since the announcement in 2022, millions – if not billions – of euros have been invested in the construction of new buildings in Neuburg-on-the-Donau and in the recruitment of several hundred people to develop the 2026 engine.

Expenses already incurred, already spent, which place Audi and the Volkswagen group in a complex situation and in a terrible dilemma. Should the project continue, assume the colossal sums already invested (and which still have to be invested) in a context of unprecedented budgetary rigor on a group scale, to the detriment of thousands of jobs at VAG? Or should the tap be turned off as quickly as possible, ""sold"" the project to save what can be saved with a few million at stake - which obviously will not reimburse everything that has already been committed since 2022 - and try to reduce as much as possible the scale of the social plan that is being prepared in Germany?

Of course, Volkswagen could use the popularity of Formula 1 as a huge advertising spot and as a last (desperate?) attempt to revive its global sales, especially in Asia. The group had notably bet heavily on the Chinese market, but the strategy turned into a fiasco. Far from us the desire to revive unfounded rumors, we could then say to ourselves that a Guanyu Zhou could be the best advertisement for Audi and the Volkswagen group in order to give themselves a last chance on the Chinese market, the driver from Shanghai - the first and only Chinese driver in Formula 1 - enjoying incredible popularity in the Middle Kingdom. A reflection which could notably explain why Audi is taking so long to choose its second driver for 2025...

It really worked, it looked the part, it drove the part, and was/is fast. The GT-E is quite frankly also a very good hybrid solution, that should have been had more emphasis by VW. The GTE was bland, too small of a range, and lacked all spirit. \n\nThe ID models 'should' have done a better job, but instead, they're just that, bland and boring. It's like they introduced some new division that nobody was waiting for or interested in, and it did not work because they had nothing to interest them in anyway. \n\nIf at least they looked great, fun, sporty, attractive, it could have wheeled in buyers. Imagine if they sold them in bright colors, more 'fun' styled, with also enjoyable interior colors and materials, and a better user interface.\n\nAll of that has nothing to do with Audi and F1. It's simply mismanagement by VW, and particularly their VW brand. Because quite frankly, Porsche is doing well. Audi is doing well. Skoda even is doing well.

Its just the matter of who pits first and who undercuts whom. We dont get to see different strategies or multiple pit stops which shuffle the grid entirely. 

Also, in the recent races we've seen that Max struggles with hards a lot. He drops pace almost a second per lap. Yet his performance on mediums and softs (in qualifying) is on par with Mclaren and Ferrari. Why dont Red Bull try the Med-Med-Soft which might perform better? And even if not, he will still be fast during last few laps and can get the fastest lap points.","['The difference in time between Medium-Hard one stop compared to a Med-Med-Soft two stop needs to be significant enough to overcome the 17-25 seconds lost in the additional pit stop AND have a large enough pace advantage to overtake almost the entire field.', 'Tyres are holding on and keeping good pace, so finding the time for an extra pit stop is very tough.

I'd love to hear some people's suggestions on how a better rule could be written. It might also be useful to the discussion for others to poke holes in suggested rules, to see how they could be gamed. Maybe ultimately we can come up with something better...

IMO rules should be very simple to understand in the heat of battle, but also very clear cut to enable easy decision making by the stewards.","['Send it. Let the gods decide.', '""Just do it""', 'Maybe stay on the track.\nLegal defending must remain within track limits or lose position', 'Really simple.\n\nIf aproaching the corner there is overlap of at least front wheel to rear wheel then both cars must be left at least a cars width to the edge of the track on both inside and outside.\n\nSimples', "">How would you write a better overtaking rule?\n\nI wouldn't.\n\nThe problem is that as soon as you codify what overtaking is in the rules, you'll get teams challenging everything that falls outside that definition. And there's often going to be scenarios that arise where you cannot address them.\n\nTake, for instance, the incident between Verstappen and Norris at Turn 4 in Mexico. Norris was slightly ahead of Verstappen going into the corner. Does that mean that he had completed an overtake? No -- as we have seen on countless occasions, you need to be a good way ahead of another driver to overtake around the outside there. But if Norris had been on the inside of the corner, he would need to be much less further ahead of Verstappen to make that pass work. So straight away we have a corner where the criteria for judging the success of an overtake is different depending on the position of the cars on the track. You can't write a rule to address that, because then you'd have to write a rule to address every position going into every corner on every circuit. And that's before we even consider the presence of Sainz in the Turn 4 incident -- he was going through a slow apex when Verstappen and Norris arrived. Verstappen's choices were a) brake hard, b) hit Sainz, or c) take a more shallow line to avoid contact. He chose the third option, which on balance was probably the best option since braking hard risked a lock-up and hitting Sainz was never an option.\n\nThe vast majority of responses to the proposal of writing rules around overtaking seem to have one thing in mind: creating a scenario were Norris can get ever-so-slightly ahead of Verstappen, and thus requiring Verstappen to immediately concede the position."", 'Both cars stay within track limits. \n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.', 'I think all the rule needs is to forget ""ahead at the apex"" and focus on ""ahead in the braking zone"".

Some fans might have some idea, but that\'s as good as it\'s going to get. Asking ""us"" to write *better* rules is futile.

1geekse,What was happening with Charles on Sunday? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1geekse/what_was_happening_with_charles_on_sunday/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1geekse/what_was_happening_with_charles_on_sunday/,2024-10-28,1 days,"This is a genuine question because I wasn’t able to watch the race and instead caught glimpses in live timings

The main thing i seen about the race was discourse over regulations and then flashes of discourse from the Ferrari  side.

I kind of assumed it was a bit of dramatics from Charles fans (I am also a Charles fan but sometimes things are blown out of proportion), like claiming Ferrari used team orders to stop Charles overtaking in Australia when Charles was never in the position to.

But I finally decided to go back and see what happened and I am so confused about what happened in the first stint.

I don’t think I have enough technical f1 knowledge to know what Ferrari were trying to do. I seen a comment from Fred after seeming to talk about future engine saving?

How urgent was this because continuing to tell Charles to slow his pace and letting him build such a gap is so risky, unless it was needed to finish the race strong.

Especially when they know Lando’s behind and something that’s been true all season but was especially evident with Mclarens updates the previous race, is Mclaren is a different beast on hards.

In COTA, Mclaren went from not even being close to a threat to having more pace than Ferrari on the hards. Ferrari never had to worry about it cause he was stuck behind Max but if he wasn’t then he would’ve been a threat to at least Carlos.

I think COTA made people almost underestimate the pace of the Mclaren because of the dirty air medium stint, but go back and look at Lando on hards, in dirty air. He had very minimal tire age advantage as well.

So going into the second stint, with no Max in between, that is a very dangerous position to be in.

The second stint seems pretty simple. Good pace, get stuck in dirty air behind cars, have Lando catch up and the push very, very hard to try and stay ahead which hurt his tires, especially cause the majority of his pushing was when overtaking lapped cars.

That was the right plan of action for that stint because Mercedes were too far back to be a threat, and so it’s let Lando past and nurse tires or push hard and burn tires but maybe be able to hold Lando back.

But Charles should’ve been able to have a big enough gap from the medium stint to be able to have a solid pace and manage his tires without having to base it on Lando.

You can never bet against Mclaren (specifically Lando) not having the pace advantage on hards on low fuel. Lando has never not been the fastest in those conditions since Imola, unless something he’s stuck behind someone or other extenuating circumstances.

So what i’m wondering is what was the issue? Was it a we need to do this for the sake of the race and the car or we should do this because it’ll help us later and Charles is in a pretty safe position.

Having two drivers running p1 and p2 when they have similar pace and are close together, especially if the one behind has slightly better pace but nothing to switch positions over is a very difficult situation to handle, so was it Ferrari choosing an advantageous time so the drivers wouldn’t fight each other? 

I’m genuinely asking out of confusion because i feel like i’ve missed so many details and i don’t understand what the radio messages were really meaning.","[""It's likely that the brakes were actually heating up too much, given the thin air in Mexico - this was massively exacerbated by running behind Sainz for a short while, especially the 3 or 4 laps where he was within 1.5 seconds.\n\nI will put a little tweak to your points though. Sainz was faster in Mexico, but in Australia the team did radio to Charles to stop him from fighting Sainz. This was because they didn't think they'd be able to challenge for the win again this season - how wrong they were!"", '>You can never bet against Mclaren (specifically Lando) not having the pace advantage on hards on low fuel. Lando has never not been the fastest in those conditions since Imola, unless something he’s stuck behind someone or other extenuating circumstances.\n\nAt the end, it was pretty much this.

He had to use LiCo to cool the car and had some holdup from a few backmarkers which closed the gap to Lando.\n\nI’ve seen more than a few fans of a certain fanbase suggest nefarious conspiracies and it really shows how unhinged fans can be.', 'I did not compare his onboard with Carlos. But his brake was nearly overheated all the time, which was caused by dirty air probably. And he was seldom great in Mexico, which may also relate to the LiCo issue.', 'Leclerc was asked to do lico and so was Sainz. However when Leclerc hit the back marker traffic he was told ‘no more lico’ so I assume he was saving his engine for needing to overtake backmarkers. The backmarkers not letting him through quickly enough didn’t help. The McLaren comes alive in the second stint and Norris (who has been saving his tyres for this part of his race) starts eating up the advantage Leclerc built over him throughout the race. Leclerc couldn’t do anything about that as his tyres had gone. Norris was already faster and getting quicker. It was a case of when Norris would pass him not if. He just made it easier by going off the track. \n\nI know that Ferrari radioed Charles to tell him not to fight Sainz, but in their defence it was the right decision. Sainz was faster and they would have lost time fighting knowing that Norris would be coming back at them in the second stint. It worked for Ferrari. I wouldn’t have minded them fighting, it would have been Norris’ win if that happened.', ""I mean even if there was a serious issue with the PU or overheating with the breaks, i doubt they would say it on the radio outright. plus if these were indirect team orders charles' expression after the race would let you know. he is not good at hiding his displeasure lol.\n\nmy conspiracy theory is ollie's crash in fp1 and the rebuild after that did more damage than expected."", 'Backmarkers fucked him.

I believe the general consensus amongst F1 fans in general is that Norris has more pace while Piastri has a better composure. What do you think is more important then ? Is it speed or mentality ? Also who is more likely to turn things around... is it Lando improving his mentality and his starts or is it Oscar becoming quicker (especially over one lap) ?","['Ask me after the next season, if Piastri is still not matching Norris by the end of that then Norris is better with the higher ceiling.', 'Piastri is 1cm taller, so all ceilings will be relatively lower.', ""I have no way to evaluate who has a higher ceiling and I won't pretend to.

1. They are arriving in the corner pretty much side-by-side, Lando being slightly ahead, he squeezes Max to the apex.

2. They are still side-by-side, Verstappen is almost in the back of the Ferrari, gets squeezed even tighter to the apex, Max starts slightly going wider to avoid driving to the back of the Ferrari.

3. You see Max going wider, otherwise he would've crashed into the back of the Ferrari, you could argue that he went wider to take evasive action into crashing into the Ferrari.

4. Max stays in the white lines, Lando goes slightly off, is barely outside of the white lines.

5. Lando just ignores the track lines completely and takes a sharp right turn.

6. You can see Lando take even sharper turn to the right to completely cut off the corner to end up ahead of Sainz and Verstappen, but Sainz has the speed advantage and overtakes Norris once again.

I'm not trying to defend anyone here, I just want to understand the penalty better.","[""It's simple. Lando was alongside Max at the apex (less than half a car length alongside).

He\'s not taking evasive actions, he\'s running wide on purpose. Why ? Because he knows Lando is on his outside, and he wants to run him out of road just like he did last week. Except this time, Lando was ahead at the apex, so while he didn\'t get penalised for it last week, this time around he\'s supposed to give him the space, and he didn\'t - on purpose, again, it\'s not like he doesn\'t know how much speed he can carry, or how much angle he can or can\'t give his steering wheel.', '“Max goes wide not to crash into the Ferrari” Really?

But then he would have lost the position of course because the next turn is a sharp right.\n\nI also tried to judge if Norris would even have made the corner if he would have been given space. But I\'m not sure about that. Maybe, maybe not. We\'ll never know. And from what we learned last week in COTA it doesn\'t even matter because it\'s only important that you\'re ahead at the apex. That\'s the real BS in all of this.', ""I'm no expert in the rules and I don't even have a strong opinion either way, but I'll try to make the case for the penalty:\n\n1. Lando is slightly ahead going into the corner, which (as per the current rules) entitles him to space through the corner\n2. Lando is leaving enough space for Max on the inside (pretty much the normal reacing line, as can be seen by Max basically following Carlos' line into the corner exactly)\n3. Max is boxed in between Carlos in front and Lando on his right. This is a shitty situation for Max but not really uncommon, especially at the start of races. In this case you sometimes just have to brake harder and concede if you don't want to crash into the car in front. Max could have covered the outside on the straight before and Lando would probably go to the inside and be in the same position that Max found himself in.\n4. Max tries to avoid braking by opening the steering and taking a wider line through the corner. If he wants to do that, he still has to make sure Lando has space through the corner. \n5. Obviously I don't know but the track is quite wide and I find it hard to believe that Max wasn't able to take a tighter line, even after opening the steering, that leaves Lando enough space to stay on track. He doesn't do that.\n6. To me, it looks like he doesn't try very hard to tighten his line but is happy with drifting wide because he knows that will make Lando either crash into him or go off track. \n7. Therefore you could argue he pushed Lando off the track even though Lando was (as per the current rules) entitled to space. Thats why the penalty is deserved."", 'Pretty simple. Drivers are side by side so both drivers need to leave space. Lando left space for max on the inside, max did not leave space for Lando on the outside.']",0,60,2024-10-30 06:38:49, Discussion,0,0
