By now, there shouldn't be any smidgen of doubt that RB needs to part with Checo Perez.
He is not able to extract any sort of performance from the RB20.
It's getting ridiculous how big the gap has become with Max... and the rest of the field.

Realistically, I think there's only two options: either promote Lawson or Tsunoda to RB.
Tsunoda in that respect is, although talented,  bit erratic in his driving as of late.
Lawson on the other might be the best choice IMO. Of course he's not that experienced yet (so there's always the danger of a Gasly, Kvyat or Albon scenario at RB), but he drives calmly and smart.

A swap with one of them is not an option I think for Perez. That would be an embarrassment, frankly.

This is de Zordo's first year, behind a new Principal, and he has delivered the goods with the upgrades Haas has received all year.  Komatsu is doing a great job as principal, but I wanted to shoutout de Zordo too because Komatsu can keep the team organized and all pulling in the same direction, and that's great, but without competent technical direction it's hard to imagine a team going from P10 to P6 with as few resources to work with as Haas has.

With Simone Resta, the relatively well-regarded technical chief from previous years, moving on to greener pastures at Mercedes this year, it would be easy to imagine Haas technical direction taking a step backwards this year.   De Zordo has filled that gap nicely, delivering a very clean set of upgrades that has consistently permitted his team to perform well ahead of the team's median expectations, with nearly every upgrade added to the car resulting in at least a few more points for the team as a whole.  For a team fighting from the back into the midfield, that's an impressive accomplishment.

For the team with the fewest developmental resources in Formula 1, Haas has performed way above their own heads at key times this year, and while Komatsu deserves a large share of the laurels for that, and some credit is due to the drivers as well, de Zordo and his team should not be forgotten.","['Haas and Ferrari did a great job fixing their tire wear issue over the winter.', 'Nice to meet you Andrea x', 'Really makes you wonder how hard Steiner was holding the team back.', 'Shoutout Ferrari', 'Is this a self-advertisement?', 'Remember when in testing people were saying Haas should be kicked out because they were 5 seconds off the pace?

I realize every track is different and Haas will likely not get to the points in every race for the rest off the season but their upward trend seems obvious. I do not have a deep technical understanding but a lot of people seem to view the 2025 season as an extension of 2024 when it comes to car development due to no rule changes and the maturity of the current rule set. Based on that Haas is probably in a better position for next year than they have been in at least 5 years.

Back to Ocon. On the face of it, he had a horrible season. He lost the power battle within Alpine to his arch rival, was publicly demoted to nr 2 and then announced not to be extended. It seems like he was lucky that Haas offered him a seat at all (although i personally believe he is a solid choice and deserves a seat in F1). In previous years, a change from Alpine/ Renault to Haas would have been a strong demotion, but since this year it is actually a bit of a promotion?! Haas has more than 3x the points of Alpine and the whole saga around the Alpine engine does not seem like they will calmly work to improve the car again?

Long story short: Did Ocon lose his seat to luck into a significantly better team next year? Sort of the reverse Sainz?","['Getting your hopes up for HAAS crushing it next season is a good way to get hurt.', ""Ocon was actively trying to leave Alpine. They basically announced they were not extending a driver who didn't want to extend with them in the first place. \n\nI'd say, probably, from his point of view just getting away from Alpine was a win. Haas performing better than Alpine is just a nice bonus."", 'Never completely trust Haas.', 'Not sure what to think about Ocon and Alpine. I mean alpine let him go and Monaco was probably a good excuse at that but reports were that Ocon had been shopping around even before the 2024 season started. \n\nI really would like to know what happened between Ocon and Alpine because he got a 3 year contract in 2021 and things seemingly were on the up. I think Ocon was just glad to get out of Alpine and the relationship has clearly suffered. \n\nHe even said very recently that he’s lost enjoyment for racing and is just going through the motions at this point. Alpine themselves have lost out on, in my opinion, the best midfield pairing on the grid. Gasly and Ocon are two drivers who I’d want if I was leading a team in the midfield and I’m not sure if Doohan is really a great replacement but we can only see until he’s in that car. \n\nBack to the original point, Haas are doing well and Komatsu has done a great job however we don’t know whether that will correlate to next year. They’re on a good trajectory but they also were in 2018 and then produced a car that was a tyre shredder in 2019. If Haas continue to be on a good trajectory and produce a car that starts challenging the top 4 teams then yes, Ocon is a huge winner out of all of this.', ""If Haas can keep this trajectory going then I'd say he's the winner of silly season, not just one of. It'll be the definition of failing upward.\n\nBig if though but Alpine aren't going anywhere positive either."", 'Trusting in Haas not to cock it up is quite brave', 'Three teams on the grid you must never trust even if they show form and signs of having gotten their shit together:\n\n1. Ferrari\n\n2. McLaren \n\n3. Haas', 'The midfield is forever in flux.\n\nAlpine’s said their 2025 car is completely different, and the upgrades they brought at COTA are part of their 2025 development. They’re taking home a lot of windtunnel time as well to develop their car. They’re also taking the Merc engine for 26, which is supposedly the best available for those reg’s.\n\nHaas is having a really good year this year. But we don’t know if they’ll further progress for next year, if they’ll slip back, or stay the same. They’re having less windtunnel time than they’re used to next year.\n\nCould be either of them, and then it could all change again for 26. Personally I’d bet on Alpine long term out of the two. \n\nI also think there’s security in Gasly’s position (being the only french thing left in the french national team) which should help him extend if he doesn’t get other offers. Meanwhile Ocon is more vulnerable to this being his last contract by not having those kind of ties, plus Merc who he’s tied to has passed him over once again.', ""Reminder that Alpine were considerably better than Haas have been this year.\n\nMidfield teams crossover from season to season is the most volatile thing in F1.

Jokes aside, how do these meetings pan out? What kind of plans do they discuss? Maybe I'm wrong but it must be depressing to discuss different plans when the whole camp must know they will come in pretty much last place.

This is what Sainz said about that kind of situation at the Japanese post-race press conference early this year. For context, if you need it: last year people were saying Ferrari strategy was terrible but this year they improved a lot. \n\n>   **Autosport:** Ferrari seem pretty strategically sharp in this race - it's been something the team's been criticized for a lot in the past - I just wondered could you to expand on any particular work you've seen the team doing and how pleased you feel about that?\n\n>   **Sainz:** I think we made some progress on strategy over the last three years progressively but if you see a jump this year on strategy it's purely down to the car. I think just having a car that allows you to have flexibility on strategy is something that last year we couldn't have, so we were boxed in to stop at certain laps, we couldn't extend, we had so much deg that it looked always like people could extend and then come back on us on a harder tire. Last year we were just zero flexible and we couldn't do anything with our racing so it looked like we were not getting the strategy right a lot of times. But when you have a car that is better on tyres, two drivers that can push on the car more often, and you have that extra flexibility, your strategy also looks better.

It wouldn\'t have been a guarantee because Sainz isn\'t the easiest to pass either, but by the end Lando was almost 5-7 tenths a lap faster than Ferraris on some laps.

So in the case of Formula 1, Andretti would build the chassis and run the trackside operations while Dallara would build and provide the engines. Exactly how this would have been branded remains to be seen. As for why they would do it this way, there are two obvious advantages: first, they can pitch it as an American team using an American engine, which they couldn't do if they were just supplying an engine to another team.

# The Formation Lap

Gather ‘round racing friends, for the tires are warm and it’s time to hit the track… From driver news to team updates and technical tweaks, the tenth edition of *Last Week in Formula 1* is ready to take you on a hot lap.

Before we get started, if you missed last week’s issue [you can catch up here.](https://lastweekinformula1.substack.com/p/last-week-in-formula-1-october-14-20-2024)

If you’re a rookie ‘round these parts and wondering what you're in for, *Last Week in Formula 1* is a weekly newsletter compiling the most interesting, important, and informative goings-on in the Formula 1 world.

Every fun fact, story, and piece of news has been sourced from posts in r/formula1 (AKA: Formula 1’s publicly accessible online paddock).

Given this is The Internet, take everything you read with a grain of salt. However, after over three years of following the subreddit, there’s far more truth than lies posted—and much of the news comes from reputable sources.

On a semi-related note, like the cars we enjoy watching so much, *Last Week in Formula 1* is in a constant state of development. Any feedback you have on what’s covered, the format, or anything I missed is welcome in the comments.

And if you, like me, enjoy pretty things…

You can have the pretty-with-pictures version of *Last Week in Formula 1* delivered to your email inbox every Monday [by subscribing on Substack.](https://lastweekinformula1.substack.com/)

Now let’s get down to business…

# The Mexican Grand Prix



**Qualifying:**

P1. Carlos Sainz

P2. Max Verstappen

P3. Lando Norris



**Grand Prix:**

P1. Carlos Sainz

P2. Lando Norris

P3. Charles Leclerc



***LWIF1’s Reaction:***

Good lord F1 has been spicy. Unless Red Bull pulls a purple’n’blue rabbit outta their butts and manages to unlock a sizeable pace advantage over McLaren AND Ferrari *right now*, I’d wager we’re in for ever-increasing spiciness in the closing rounds. Lando’s WDC bid looks to be losing steam, at least if you consider how the amount of points he needs to gain in each race is growing rather than shrinking. Say what you will about Max’s boundary-breaking defensive tactics, but they’re proving effective—and highlighting how cunning and calculating he is… Talk about being 10/10 villain.

***Personal highlights from Mexico include:***

* The most action-packed, entertaining, dare I say *cinematic* Mexican Grand Prix in recent memory (and possibly ever?) 
* Carlos Sainz reclaiming his coveted P1 from Max with a classy overtake, then steaming off into the distance, presumably powered by chilis.  
* Contentious (and rather pissy) wheel-to-wheel action through the pack.  
* A double points finish for Haas, vaulting them into P6 in the WCC.  
* And more fuel for the driving standards fiery war of words…

\~\~\~

# The Drivers’ Mutterings & Musings

*The hottest talking point coming out of Austin and Mexico is the latest flare-up about racing standards between drivers (courtesy of Max Verstappen’s stout defensive maneuvers against Lando Norris).*

*General consensus seems that Max has been toeing the line of how the existing rules and standards are laid out—but that said existing rules and standards are part of the problem in not supporting hard and fair racing, while leaving a lot open to the interpretation of drivers and stewards alike.*

*Hence the outpouring of statements about* [*how Austin exposed the flaws in F1’s driving standards*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9cvfm/how_austin_exposed_the_flaws_in_f1s_driving/)*,* [*calls for a racing regulation overhaul*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9eo4u/jenson_button_calls_for_fia_rule_change_after/)*, and the current rules being* [*a blueprint to dissuade overtaking.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9eo4u/jenson_button_calls_for_fia_rule_change_after/)

*If you’d like to better understand these mysterious racing regulations,* [*this article courtesy of The Race is your best bet*](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/little-known-new-f1-rules-already-affecting-racing/)*, given the FIA chose not to make their 2024 regulations publicly available, unlike in years gone by.*

*Meanwhile, Mulletman Bottas has taken a simpler view,* [*claiming that some drivers are taking the piss outta the racing regulations…*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbah1i/valtteri_bottas_claims_some_drivers_taking_the_p/) *Fair enough VB!*

*Relatedly… On the heels of the above, Investigative Redditor* u/stetoe [*put together this brilliant post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9dt5h/with_calls_for_new_rule_changes_after_verstappens/) *compiling all of the F1 rule changes that have occurred since 2016 as a direct result of Max doing Max things.*

*(For those fascinated and eager for a follow up, by popular demand* u/stetoe *cobbled together similar posts as above,* [*but for rules changed due to Lewis Hamilton,*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga7lqk/by_request_i_also_compiled_all_the_f1_rules/) *as well as for* [*the changes triggered by Sebastian Vettel)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbsett/surprisingly_few_all_the_f1_rules_changed_or/)*.*

***Okay, let’s move on from the driving standards rabble-babble:***

Fernando Alonso started his 400th Grand Prix in Mexico (pretty impressive for a rookie, if I may say so), [celebrating the occasion with this lovely special lid.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8s0xp/fernando_alonso_will_start_his_400th_f1_gp_in/)

In celebration of his time-bending achievement, Young Fernando appeared on F1’s Beyond The Grid podcast to discuss [why—and how—he’s still fired up for racing in Formula 1 after 400 races](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga67mt/fernando_at_400_why_alonsos_still_fired_up/) (hint: he might be a vampire).

Thanks to his dynamite opening performances, there’s a [“carambola (which means *lucky chance* in Argentine Spanish) for Franco Colapinto to be on the grid next year.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8w9ma/virutasf1_there_is_a_carambola_for_franco/) In order for that to happen though, there’ll have to be driver movement elsewhere on the grid—as well as sponsors who will have a say.

*Aaaaand apparently* [*Franco has an offer on the table from Red Bull:*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gckaxb/sky_italia_f1_drivers_market_future_of_colapinto/) For which team and seat we know not. The hang-up, of course, is that Williams would have to release or loan Franco to a team they’ve got eyes on competing with soon… But JV did say the other week that he wants Franco on the grid, regardless if that means Williams loses points as a result. So who knows!

Pundit Lawrence Barretto claims that [“Valtteri Bottas is in good shape to retain his Sauberaudi seat, but F2 championship leader Gabriel Bortoleto is still under consideration”.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gahgbl/lawrence_barretto_i_understand_valtteri_bottas_is/) I say give me another rookie or give me death!

However, returning for another with Sauberaudi isn’t Valtteri’s only option, apparently. [Lawrence also reports that Bottas is in talks with Mercedes to return in a non-racing role as a back up](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbamaw/lawrence_barretto_valtteri_bottas_says_his/) (meaning reserve, I presume). 

And given we’re on the Americas leg of the season, the annual [“Sergio Perez is in trouble and perhaps on his last legs”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gauy46/contract_warning_for_sergio_perez_after_lawson/) rumours are bubbling up from the underworld. I’ll report on them due to his woeful trend of underperformance, but definitely, absolutely, certainly take them a spoonful of salt or two.

*However, his dearth of performance in Mexico won’t help matters.*

For another rumbling to take with a spoonful of salt (sadly), at Honda’s ~~incessant pressuring~~ behest, [Yuki Tsunoda seems to be *finally* getting a Red Bull test in Abu Dhabi this year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb956m/lawrence_barretto_yuki_tsunoda_says_theres_a_good/) Much as I’d love to see him have a season in the car, I think we all know this won’t go anywhere though :(

\~\~\~

# The Teams’ Twistings & Turnings

The War of Words between McLaren and Red Bull has been quick to return to boil, with [Lando throwing some shade at Max](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8rtba/but_the_rules_are_the_rules/) (and the FIA). In blithe response, [Max noted that McLaren have been “complaining a lot lately.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8l92a/mclaren_complain_a_lot_lately_says_verstappen_as/)

Meanwhile, Master Shit-Stirrer [Toto Wolff called Red Bull’s contentious ride height adjustment device “outrageous” and laughed at their “Bugs Bunny” tool.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8mzbk/wolff_labels_red_bull_bib_device_outrageous/) In a cantina somewhere in Mexico City, Zak Brown was seen furiously scribbling notes on “how to stir the pot without being labeled a Karen…”

\~\~\~

# Technical Tidbits

In a move that all fans are sure to hate if this results in what I expect it will, [Duracell has become F1’s first DRS Zone sponsor in Las Vegas.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8sz6d/duracell_becomes_f1s_first_drs_zone_sponsor_in/) I can hear the calls now… *“Max Verstappen enters the Duracell DRS Zone, which will surely help him stay ahead of Lando Norris for at least one more lap.”* If this pans out like Tissot’s sprint race sponsorship in MotoGP, you *will* hear “Duracell” every time the camera feed moves through this section of track.

If you, like everyone at Mercedes I presume, are tired of the ride height shenanigans of this current generation of cars, [you’ll be thrilled to know that F1’s 2026 regulations will leave behind the current ride height nightmares.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga76b3/why_f1s_2026_rules_will_shake_off_rideheight/)

\~\~\~

# Paddock Playtime

I’m not sure how this video was allowed to escape the Red Bull garage, [so get a load of what a current F1 car looks like under the skin while you still can.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb68a0/formula_aerodynamics_so_much_technology_fudo2/)

Williams and their new partner Mercado Libre (courtesy of Young Gun Franco Colapito) put together [this fun little commercial](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb2gp5/mercado_libre_commercial_revealing_the_new/) revealing their special livery for Mexico and Brazil. [Gallery pics of the car can be found here if you wish.](https://www.williamsf1.com/posts/1b734b55-9192-45df-9211-a3dc22479449/williams-racing-mercado-libre-heritage-inspired-yellow-engine-cover)

If you happen to have a cool few million to burn on non-essentials, [you can get your paws on Michael Schumacher’s 2006 Ferrarimobile.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1galaue/michael_schumachers_2006_ferrari_formula_1_car_is/)

Perhaps the world’s most famous bulldog, [Roscoe, son of Lewis, turns 12!](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbcj2s/lewishamilton_everyone_wish_my_son/)

Who knew [Charles Leclerc would look so natural and at home in a mariachi outfit?!](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb71zy/charles_leclerc_arriving_at_the_paddock_dressed/) I suppose that’s that pretty privilege coming to the fore…

Should you have the niche curiosity of wondering what driving the F1 Safety Car is like, long-time [SC Pilot Bernd Maylander spilled the beans on his (pretty neat) job in this interview with Formula 1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gclkgk/maylander_on_what_its_like_to_drive_the_aston/)

Do you think Oscar is gonna outpace Lando eventually ? If so when would it happen ? In 2023 Piastri was fairly close in qualifying but his tyre management in races was missing (which is not a surprise for a rookie). In 2024 Oscar has not quite closed the gap in qualies but his racecraft has been impressive several times.

I believe the general consensus amongst F1 fans in general is that Norris has more pace while Piastri has a better composure. What do you think is more important then ? Is it speed or mentality ? Also who is more likely to turn things around... is it Lando improving his mentality and his starts or is it Oscar becoming quicker (especially over one lap) ?","['Ask me after the next season, if Piastri is still not matching Norris by the end of that then Norris is better with the higher ceiling.', 'Not in my opinion. \n\nHe’s not showing Lando’s one lap pace. He’s also not put together a proper dominant win like Lando has in Zandvoort and Singapore. \n\nI think that he and Lando seem to have opposing stinker weekends for whatever reason, which leads to us thinking they’re closer than they are.', 'Not in my opinion. People point to this being Oscar’s second season but he’s had 42 races now. In comparison, Lando’s 42nd race was midway through the 2021 season where he was 3rd (yes THIRD) in the drivers championship and ahead of both Perez and Bottas in the clear 3rd/4th best car. He had a run of like 8 top 5 finishes in a row in that car.\n\nI don’t think Oscar has shown that he has the one lap pace of Lando and thats usually something that comes pretty quick, for example we saw Lando outqualify Sainz in his first 2 seasons, and Leclerc outqualify Vettel in his 2nd season. In comparison Oscar is losing 16-4 H2H so far this season.\n\nOscar is still improving but people still don’t like to admit how good Lando is (who is still improving himself), which sometimes makes Oscar look worse than he is. Who knows how it plays out, but I feel like Norris will always have the edge imo', 'Piastri is 1cm taller, so all ceilings will be relatively lower.', ""I have no way to evaluate who has a higher ceiling and I won't pretend to. But what I do find funny and weird is any claim that Piastri will be better because he keeps his composure better and is calmer. Since when is that something necessary for a driver? I don't think many would describe Michael or Senna as calm. Sure it could be a good thing, but to act like it's a sign of a great driver is a bit crazy to me."", 'I find it insane how people often talk about how ""Oscar has improved rapidly"" when he has basically the same average pace gap to Lando now as he did in like the last 1/3rd of 2023', 'What I’m noticing in this thread is how people tend to gloss over Lando’s race pace and tyre management. Everyone acknowledges his qualifying pace and how quick he is over one lap but he gets much less recognition for how he’s able to zoom off into the distance as soon as he gets into clean air and gets more out of his tyres than basically anyone else. His race pace and tyre management is some of the best on the grid. Oscar is quite a bit off matching him in those areas too.', ""I want people to remember, Norris has never lost a qualifying battle in his career so far as an F1 driver.\n\nOnly other guy on the grid who can say that is Leclerc. \n\nOn top of Lando's excellent qualifying pace (31-11 against Piastri in last 2 seasons in Saturday Qualifying), he's also one of the absolute best at tyre management and banging in consistently excellent laptimes throughout a stint. \n\nLando's weaknesses currently is aggression in wheel to wheel battles and race starts (much improved compared to midseason especially, Baku, Singapore, COTA Sprint, Mexico all were good starts, only bad one was COTA main race, and even that like almost noone in last few years has held the lead into T1, even Verstappen and Leclerc lost the lead in 2021 and 2023 respectively).\n\nAnd as you can see in Mexico, he was much more decisive with Verstappen in the T4 maneuver compared to COTA, which shows his learning process and how he's getting better race by race.\n\nI think Piastri is extremely good, he's still only in his 2nd season and some of these tracks are still new to him. But the talent and potential is undeniable.\n\nI wouldn't say he has a higher ceiling until he starts to show that level consistently. Atleast string together 4-5 races where you constantly outqualify and out race Norris. Even in the races in the middle of the season when he beat Norris like Hungary, Spa, Monza, Etc. he relied on Norris's bad starts to get ahead and then just Norris couldn't get past due to the exact same pace in both cars."", 'Norris lives in monaco, where ceiling probably arent too high. Piastri is austrailian, probably has a nice ranch with at least double the ceiling height of lando in places.\n\nSo yes, piastri definitely has higher ceiling']",0,105,2024-10-28 22:23:17, Discussion,0,11

Max - 8 poles - 7 wins - 3 losses from pole - 2 wins without pole.

Charles - 3 poles - 3 wins - 2 losses from pole - 2 wins without pole.

Lando - 6 poles - 3 wins - 4 losses from pole - 1 win without pole.

George - 2 poles - 1 win - 2 losses from pole - 1 win without pole.

Carlos - 1 pole - 2 wins - 0 losses from pole - 1 win without pole

Oscar - 0 poles - 2 wins - 0 losses from pole - 2 wins without pole

Lewis - 0 poles - 2 wins - 0 losses from pole - 2 wins without pole.


This is common knowledge but still wanted to highlight. 
Lando stands out. 4 losses after starting in pole in a good enough mclaren.
Either lando is super good in quali or just loses the temperament in the race. There are other factors at times with luck. But max is ruthless when he is ahead. Even charles is there or thereabouts.

In general, very hard to win wdc with this conversation. Basically just depends on others falling back.

","['Lando is super good in quali. He never lost H2H with a team mate in quali. And absolutely dominated Ricciardo and Oscar.', ""None of this factors in the state of play at the time of these poles.\n\n6 of Max's poles came in the first 6 races where McLaren, Ferrari and Merc really weren't competitive and everyone thought 2022 and 2023 were being replicated. The gap between the Red Bull and everyone else was larger than whatever gap McLaren (or Ferrari) have had when they've objectively been the quickest.\n\nPeople compare this season to 2009 for good reason. If Max holds on, it's because of the opening races being dominant whilst the rest of the season saw multiple teams squabbling over wins.\n\nFerraris update after the summer break has been Red Bulls biggest friend so far. Without it, Lando is probably 20-25 points behind Max currently. But it also means that if McLaren can get ahead of Ferrari, it's a horrendous scenario for Red Bull as you're potentially looking at 5th place.\n\nLando has not been anywhere near good enough at converting his poles though. That isn't to be questioned. But comparing the different points of the season as equal is misleading."", 'Hes good but its hard to say since he never had an actual strong qualifying teammate like max or leclerc, or even russell', 'Are you genuine calling him super good right after seeing this Mexico GP?

Zandvoort, Singapore, and even like Hungary have been as dominant if not more. \n\nSpain should have been as well. Even Silverstone would have been a dominant win if you put Verstappen in that McLaren. Look at the pace Piastri had at the end, and in the wet they had no competition either.

You would never know how good they are because they didn't have a strong quali teammate.\n\nAnd I don't think Leclerc is a good qualifier. He keeps making errors in quali, like this weekend. I can't recall when was the last time Lando or Max make any errors"", "">Are you genuine calling him super good right after seeing this Mexico GP?\n\nWhere did i talk about Mexico GP? The stat i mentioned spans his entire career. Ricciardo was not a retiring driver at that time. He was one of the top rated drivers at that time and everyone's bet was he would dominate Lando. And you can use the same argument for Max. Why do you think Max is a good qualifier? What was his benchmark? Oscar is rated highly, more than any driver Max was against. I guess you started watching F1 after DTS  \n  \nAll that while Norris just qualified in third, after his championship rival that out-qualified him with the third best car?\n\nThe best car varied based on the tire compound. RB and Ferraris were quickest in softs and mediums. McLaren was the quickest in hard on race pace. Lando didn't really gain once Max pitted. Nor was he quick when he put on the hards. It was only later in the race with tire degradation that the car came alive. You could say that Lando is better at preserving tires than the Ferraris with this logic/"", ""But I'm clearly referencing a dominant streak of significant length, not particular weekends. \n\nThe grid is quite clearly closer since the European season began than the races before it.

If that somehow makes you feel like you're better than others, I'm happy for you.\n\nBut with so many great drivers at the front and the competition so enjoyable this season, I'm finding myself wishing Verstappen was just out of the picture as the battles and action between everyone else would probably be amazing.
