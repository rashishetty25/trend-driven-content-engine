I’ll be marshaling at turn 18, right under the tower at the USGP this weekend. 

I’m planning to make the Ferrari boys each their own authentic Texas felt cowboy hat. I’ll be branding them with a Scud. Ferrari emblem on the front, and their respective name/number on the brim. 

The problem is, cowboy hats are extremely finicky when it comes to sizing. I have scraped the internet to no avail, so this is my last resort: does anybody know where I can get a general idea of head dimensions/hat size/anything for Charles/Carlos? My go to guess will be medium ish for Charles (size 7 - 7 1/8) and large ish for Carlos (size 7 1/4 ish) 

Appreciate any help! If you’ll be at COTA, say hi to your friendly neighborhood marshal wearing a straw lid at T18


Edit: I have emailed/DMed SF directly, as well as Carlos and Charles talent managements. No response :( 

Edit 2: everyone saying not to give gifts, idk I think an authentic lid with the Ferrari logo burned into it would be fitting for at least PR reasons. Who knows, if one of them wins, maybe they’ll take it to the podium. Worst case it’s $100 burned and a few hours of my time ","['I’ll be brutally honest, save your money.

They're already contractual obliged to wear specific items of clothing. If they have some wiggle room in their contract, they're likely to fill it with brands they're personally associated with. Wearing anything else is likely to upset sponsors who pay big bucks to be seen being worn by drivers"", ""I do have some vague info for you, stemming from a series of helmet exchanges Seb did. When Seb swapped with George, they tried on each other's helmets, and George couldn't fit Seb's on, and it came out that Seb wore a size small helmet, and George wore size 'large at least' I think was the line. You can find the video. Well, I found a separate picture from Charles's and Seb's helmet exchange, and they could each fit in the other's helmet. It looked like maybe Charles had to shove it on a bit harder, but he did fit fine, unlike George. So... I think your assessment of Charles having smaller to mediumish head for an adult man is accurate. One more tiny data point, Lewis also managed to shove Seb's helmet on. Maybe about like Charles could. So I don't think Seb has like a tiny head, just small, and Charles and Lewis might wear one size up- or maybe two, I don't know how many sizes there are and how much wiggle room there is with helmet padding, though I believe it is pretty stiff padding. Edit: Seb used an Arai helmet, and here's their rough sizing: [https://www.revzilla.com/arai-helmets-size-chart](https://www.revzilla.com/arai-helmets-size-chart) I found a different page with like... too much information about padding thickness options, but this should be a rough estimate.\n\nReference points for Carlos. He did a helmet exchange with Lando, and Carlos's helmet didn't get remotely close to going over Lando's head. Like not even to eye level like Seb's helmet went on George. That helmet just wasn't going anywhere at all, and Carlos did try shoving it, haha. When Lando exchanged with Daniel, Lando managed to shove the helmet on. Daniel clearly had a much easier time getting on Lando's helmet, he showed the wiggle room, but the helmet did fit fully on Lando's head, unlike Carlos's. So... this is not that much of a reference point for Carlos, since I don't have a connection to any sort of resembling concrete size... but I would guess that Carlos has a smallish to maybe mediumish head for an adult man and that if you are estimating large for him, that might be wrong. Unless Lando just has a really massive head, and Daniel has a quite large one.\n\nI do agree with others who say you should save your money and are unlikely to reach them. I do agree that reaching out to trainers like I see you've done is your best chance. I do know that both of them like gifts from fans. Charles wears bracelets from fans, but something as large as a cowboy hat has travel logistics. You can always make them for yourself and a friend, and if you happen to have the opportunity to pass them off, go for it? I realize you might not have a similar size head to our best guesses for them."", ""A rule I have in life is don't give people gifts if they earn more than double what I do.""]",181,67,2024-10-15 22:21:46, Discussion,2,3

Silverstone he had a great drive aided by Mclaren having a pitwall meltdown. Hungary I'll give you and Belgium he had an engine penalty and the DRS zone down the Kemmel straight was shortened which made overtaking way harder for everyone.\n\nI'd say Zandvoort is the real turning point for him this season. The Zandvoort result is misleading since Norris put a 2023 Verstappen margin over him, the car just wasn't with him in Monza or Baku and he was INCREDIBLY lucky that the Ferraris and Piastri started as far down as they did in Singapore.""]",136,30,2024-10-15 22:21:47, Social Media,13,0

I'm not saying that's necessarily *the* characteristic of the great drivers, just that some have it and others don't.

Of the recent ones, I would say Schumacher, Alonso and arguably Verstappen have this attitude. They don't do this all the time, but when necessary they do it, and seem reasonably OK with the choice. 

Hamilton, Rosberg and Vettel are capable of this, and have crashed into other people deliberately (or deliberately effected a crash, if you like), but I get the sense that these were out of frustration or anger; they were never in ""control"" of the situation.

My question is: who was the last British champion driver who had that kind of ruthlessness about him? 

I don't think Button had it, nor Hill (despite that threat during Spa '98). Maybe Mansell, but I'm slightly too young to have watched him live, and my abiding image of him is pushing very hard during a race and having his car breakdown one way or another. 

Again, I don't think this is necessarily a desirable quality in a driver, nor does it mean a driver who has it is better or worse than others.

**EDIT** Thanks for your responses everyone. I guess a lot of you are quite sure it's Hamilton, which is fair enough. You never really know someone, but maybe his more ruthless side is masked by his off-track personality, which (to me at least) comes across as a bit softer than those of the three I mentioned at the top of the post. I'm trying to say this without stigmatizing discussion of mental health, but there have been times where he comes across as more psychologically vulnerable than the other drivers -- specifically in his last couple of years at McLaren, and in that battle with Rosberg. All drivers react to pressure at some point (remember that scene of Hakkinen crying in the bushes?) but I feel as if you could get into Hamilton's head, you could affect his performance in a way that you would not Schumacher or Verstappen. But maybe that's misguided.

From the replies there also seems to be a specific time period in Hamilton's career where this aggression is more evident. If we break it down, there's 

1. The McLaren years
2. The Rosberg Mercedes years
3. Post-Rosberg Mercedes

There's a little debate whether 1. or 2. is the more ""ruthless"" era, maybe both combined. Just my opinion again, but I generally feel most drivers are much more aggressive in their early years, and especially if they're in a more capable car. And the Rosberg-Hamilton years felt more full of snide jabs and highschool drama (awkward cool-down moments, passive-aggressive interviews etc.) to me than the madness of the Hamilton-Alonso year.","['Heres a surprise.
