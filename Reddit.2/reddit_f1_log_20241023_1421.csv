1g9m354,Ferrari brought an adjusted front wing to Austin - but didn't have to declare it because it was only a composite material change,https://formu1a.uno/it/sviluppi-ferrari-ce-un-importante-retroscena-sui-miglioramenti-della-sf-24/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9m354/ferrari_brought_an_adjusted_front_wing_to_austin/,2024-10-22,0 days,,"['> Initially, the new front wing design was set to debut in Austin, but it appeared earlier in Singapore. **A \'base\' version of the wing was further developed in Texas with more flexible composite materials.** It was an undeclared update, as the aerodynamic shapes of the wing remained the same, but it provided a significant boost in high-speed efficiency, where the SF-24 surprisingly emerged as the best car.\n\n[From another article:](https://formu1a.uno/it/doppietta-ferrari-vasseur-sviluppiamo-fino-in-qatar/)\n\n> ""Updates? Use your imagination,"" he said somewhat cryptically, even laughing, without going into details.

""**You only have to declare aerodynamic updates that change the external shapes of the components.** But we\'re all pushing, including us."" One of the technical themes this year has certainly been flexible wings, and in Singapore, after reassurances from the FIA, Ferrari introduced their new front wing and is continuing in that direction.

First, I want to emphasize that the intention of my previous post was not to single out Verstappen negatively. In fact, I respect Verstappen as an exceptional talent who pushes the boundaries of the sport.

So, by request, here's a deep dive into the rules that have been changed or clarified solely because of Lewis Hamilton's actions.

- - -  

**1. Gaining an Advantage Off-Track Clarification**

Race: 2008 Belgian Grand Prix


Incident: Hamilton cut the chicane while battling Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen, allowing him to overtake. He let R√§ikk√∂nen back past but immediately overtook him again at the next corner.

Rule Clarification: The FIA clarified that if a driver gains an advantage by leaving the track, they must not only give back the position but also ensure they do not retain any lasting advantage. Immediate re-overtaking or benefiting from a better position due to going off-track is prohibited. This clarification aimed to ensure fairness in racing duels.

**2. Emphasis on Honesty with Officials**

Race: 2009 Australian Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton and his McLaren team were found to have provided misleading information to the stewards regarding an incident under the safety car involving Jarno Trulli. Initially, Hamilton told the stewards he did not deliberately let Trulli pass, leading to Trulli's penalty. Later, radio transmissions revealed that Hamilton had been instructed to let Trulli pass.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced the requirement for absolute honesty in all communications with the stewards. Providing misleading information resulted in more severe penalties, including disqualification.

**3. Ban on Excessive Weaving to Defend Position**

Race: 2010 Malaysian Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton weaved multiple times on the straight to break the tow from Vitaly Petrov, who was attempting to overtake. This was deemed dangerous and unsportsmanlike.

Rule Change: The FIA expanded the rules on defensive driving, stating that drivers are allowed only one move to defend their position per straight and prohibiting excessive weaving to impede another car. This was introduced to enhance safety and ensure fair competition during overtaking maneuvers.

~~**4. Restrictions on Helmet Design Changes**~~


~~Implemented: 2016 Season~~

~~Incident: Hamilton frequently changed his helmet designs, making it harder for fans, commentators, and officials to identify drivers quickly.~~

~~Rule Change: The FIA introduced a rule starting in 2016 limiting drivers to one helmet design per season, with exceptions for special occasions. This aimed to improve driver recognition.~~

(*Edit: as pointed out by several users, the rule on helmet restrictions was primarily driven by the actions of Sebastian Vettel, rather then Hamilton*)

**5. Reinforcement of Pit Entry and Exit Regulations**

Race: 2018 German Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton aborted a pit stop entry by cutting across the grass to rejoin the track, crossing the pit entry line, which was against the rules.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced existing rules prohibiting crossing the pit entry and exit lines, emphasizing safety concerns. Drivers must commit to the pit entry once they cross the commitment line and cannot rejoin the track. This clarification ensured consistent enforcement of pit lane regulations.

**6. Podium Attire Regulations and Political Messaging**

Race: 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton wore a T-shirt on the podium that read ""Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor,"" highlighting social justice issues.

Rule Change: The FIA updated podium and pre-race regulations to prohibit drivers from wearing clothing with political or personal statements during official activities. Drivers must wear their race suits fully zipped up during podium ceremonies and official interviews. The aim was to maintain political neutrality during official events.

**7. Jewelry Ban Enforcement**

Race: 2022 Miami Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton wore jewelry, including piercings and necklaces, while driving, despite existing regulations prohibiting jewelry for safety reasons.

Rule Enforcement: The FIA decided to strictly enforce the existing ban on wearing jewelry during competition, requiring drivers to remove all jewelry before sessions. This emphasized safety concerns, as jewelry can hinder medical procedures or pose additional risks during accidents.
 

**8. External Assistance Clarification**

(*suggested by /u/EndiKopi*)

Race: 2007 European Grand Prix


Incident: During the race, Lewis Hamilton crashed and required assistance to be lifted back onto the track using a tractor.

Rule Clarification: Following this incident, the FIA clarified rules regarding external assistance during races. Drivers are prohibited from receiving outside help (such as tractors or other vehicles) to get back onto the track after a crash. Any external assistance provided during a race would result in penalties, emphasizing that drivers must recover on their own or with help from their team within the pit lane.


- - - 

It's interesting to note that despite his 18 years driving in Formula 1 (so far), it looks like only three rule changes or clarifications have been made solely as a result of Lewis Hamilton's driving.

Feel free to discuss or point out any additional rules I might have missed!","[""Wasn't there one in 2007 when Lewis came back to the track with the help of a tractor and then the external help rule had to be clarified?\n\nEdit: European GP 2007"", 'Jewelery ban was dope.. I remember Lewis showing up for a press conference with 4 watches', ""Not saying it had nothing to do with Hamilton but wasn't the helmet one changed mostly because of Vettel?"", 'Pretty insane that 1/4 (or could say 3/8) of the rules changed due to lewis are just about his choice of style and clothes. The FIA really does hate to see it', 'Number 1 was of note since the clarification was made after the race, then the penalty applied in retrospect.', 'Now do Schumacher üòÇ', 're: rule 7, i thought a few drivers used to race wearing necklaces and rings, not just hamilton, right? i mean i remember there as a whole debacle because they tried to explicitly ban piercings whilst allowing wedding rings for example. also rule 4 is funny bc nowadays he rarely does special helmets', ""**4. Restrictions on Helmet Design Changes**\n\nI'm pretty sure it was Vettel that prompted this.\n\nHamilton may have added things here and there and occasionally wore special helmets for a given race weekend but fundamentally Hamilton stuck with a fairly consistent design for the season\n\nbut it was Vettel who would show up with a completely new and different helmet design each race weekend making it hard for people to identify the driver."", '>6. Podium Attire Regulations and Political Messaging\n\n>Race: 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix\n\n>Incident: Hamilton wore a T-shirt on the podium that read ""Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor,"" highlighting social justice issues.\n\n>Rule Change: The FIA updated podium and pre-race regulations to prohibit drivers from wearing clothing with political or personal statements during official activities. Drivers must wear their race suits fully zipped up during podium ceremonies and official interviews. The aim was to maintain political neutrality during official events.\n\nInviting a Presidential candidate during the election year however is maintaining neutrality?

1ga7bhc,How the tyres will work in FP2 in Mexico? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga7bhc/how_the_tyres_will_work_in_fp2_in_mexico/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga7bhc/how_the_tyres_will_work_in_fp2_in_mexico/,2024-10-23,0 days,"Hello,

In Mexico, there will be a tyres test in FP2. How will it work? Pirelli wrote the following on its website, but it looks a bit difficult to understand. Can someone make it easier to understand the full process? 

>  
The first day of track action, Friday 25 October, will be slightly different to usual. The second free practice session will be entirely given over to validating the softer compounds in Pirelli‚Äôs 2025 range (C4, C5 and C6) in what is known as an in-competition test. The session is extended by 30 minutes to 90 and all drivers and teams will have to follow a specific programme established by the Pirelli engineers. Apart from the dry tyre allocation specifically for the Grand Prix (two sets of Hard, three of Medium and seven of Soft, one less than usual), each driver will have two additional sets of tyres: one will be identical to the one available for the weekend, to act as a *baseline*, while the other will be a 2025 prototype *option,* both in terms of compound and of construction ‚Äì actually the latter already homologated back in September.

>These two sets will not have any sidewall colour bands. The plan is for the programme to include a performance run and a long run for each set, with every team running the same number of laps with the same quantity of fuel on board, dependent on the type of run. The only exception will be in the case of a regular race driver being replaced for FP1 by a young driver. These race drivers will carry out the Pirelli test for 60 minutes of FP2 only and will have an additional set of Medium compound tyres to catch up as much as possible on acquiring data for the rest of the weekend. All the test data will then be analysed by Pirelli engineers to fine tune the characteristics of the compounds prior to the group test in Abu Dhabi, which starts on the Tuesday after the final round of the 2024 championship. It means that teams will have to prepare their cars for qualifying and the race in the space of two hours: FP1 on Friday and FP3 on Saturday.","[""Basically FP2 will be replaced with a tyre test. Pirelli will bring one new type of tyre, intended to replace one of the compounds for next year. For the sake of explanation, let's say they bring the tyres they're planning to use for C2 next year. \n\nEach team will get a set of the current C2 tyres as well as a set of the prototype C2s and will have to do as close to identical runs on each set as possible so Pirelli can compare the behaviour of the prototypes with the existing tyres.\n\nThe only exception is if a driver has missed FP1 because of a rookie. Then they'll get 30 minutes to do whatever their team wants before doing the Pirelli test for the remaining hour."", 'Should really be called Not-Free Practice 2', ""So it seems that the Pirelli test will take all 90 minutes of FP2, each driver will have to do a long run and a short run on a baseline set, which will be a tyre from this year, and then the same on a test set for next year that Pirelli give them. There's a baseline and a test set so that Pirelli can see the difference between this year's tyres and next year's. These run plans are set by Pirelli: numbers of laps, pace, fuel levels etc. to give Pirelli the data they want for the test tyres.\n\nWhen it comes to a driver who is replaced by a young driver in FP1, they'll do a shorter program which will only take 60 minutes, giving them 30 minutes and an extra set of mediums to do some of their usual quali/race prep."", '90 minutes of track action as a lead in to the World Series‚Ä¶Here for it', "">The only exception is if a driver has missed FP1 because of a rookie. Then they'll get 30 minutes to do whatever their team wants **before** doing the Pirelli test for the remaining hour.\n\nafter. This has been changed since last year. And although they could do whatever they like on paper, everyone must return a previously unused set of Mediums after FP2. So they are basically sure to use only those."", 'Thanks a lot. So they will know which tyre they are testing or not?', 'The FPs have always just been Friday Practice to me.\n\n*What about FP3?*\n\nDoes anyone watch FP3', 'The what?', 'More probably watch fp3 than 1 and 2']",4,10,2024-10-23 14:21:30, Discussion,-2,3

This year, we have antonelli, bearman, doohan, vesti, pourchaire and pato'O'ward, one more than last year.

Why do teams elect the Mexico FP1 session to give their young drivers a chance? What's so special about Mexico?","[""A few factors\n\n1. They want a race near the end of the season\n2. They don't want it to be a sprint race\n3. They don't want it to be a street circuit\n\nAfter the summer break only Zandvoort, Monza, Mexico and Abu Dhabi fulfil all of those criteria."", 'Mexico also has an extended FP2 session (1.5 hours), which means less time is lost for the driver whose seat is occupied by a rookie during FP1.', ""I mean O'Ward is a slam dunk being North America based and Mexican.\n\nBut teams invariably leave this stuff to the end of the season when drivers are more comfortable with their cars, there are penty of spares and (usually) less upgrades coming.\n\nThey have to run the reserve drivers at some stage so it's better to do now than a Sprint weekend or a street track."", ""1. Compared to other circuits, Mexico is particularly dusty/dirty in FP1 so it's not very representative anyway.\n\n\n\n2. It's a short, simple track, which means it's easier to make up for lost time both in terms of track learning and track time, because you can set more laps on a 1m20s circuit over 60 minutes than a 1m30s or 1m40s circuit.\n\n\n3. FP2 is extended this year so compared to other circuits the main drivers are only missing 30 minutes of total practice time (3hrs vs 2.5hrs)"", ""It's more that it's late in the year, and it doesn't have a sprint.\n\nMexico is actually a pretty unusual track because of it's extremely high altitude. There's also a Pirelli tire test in FP2, so it's really not an ideal place for a rookie FP1. Regardless, this late in the year, the only options left without sprints are Mexico, Vegas, and Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi will definitely have the most, but teams have to do one for each car, and most don't want to do it the same race- though Red Bull did last year. Last year obviously no one would do Vegas since it was a new track. It's still only the second year of the track, but I'm curious to see if any rookie fp1 will happen. So, Mexico is the best one left.\n\nTeams don't usually want to do them early for a variety of reasons. Like because they have more upgrades early, or want more familiarity with the car, or in case a driver gets sick/injured and they end up using a rookie then."", ""And Zandvoort is a fairly tricky circuit, so you'd want your drivers to get as much time as possible in practice and not miss one"", 'why is fp2 extended?', 'This is the main reason probably.', ""[Tire test for 2025's softer compounds](https://www.planetf1.com/news/2024-mexico-city-grand-prix-schedule-altered-for-pirelli-f1-2025-tyre-test).\n\nAccording to the article the teams will be doing runs planned by Pirelli, so they are limited in what they can do.""]",0,11,2024-10-23 14:21:30, Discussion,0,11
