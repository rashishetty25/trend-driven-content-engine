This includes a reorganisation of the way the regulations are laid out, which will be divided into thematic sections for clarity and consistency. The transition to the new structure will be concluded in the next few months.\n \n>The 2026 Technical Regulations (Section C), originally approved in June 2024, were subject to extensive enhancements to the aerodynamic regulations, which have been the subject of a strong collaboration between the FIA, FOM and the Formula 1 teams. This will see a higher performance from the cars, while maintaining management of the wake characteristics to promote close and exciting racing.\n \n>The 2026 Sporting Regulations (Section B) have undergone a significant update in order to simplify and modernise their structure. They have introduced measures to regulate the energy management of the Power Units as well as the management of the adjustable aerodynamics, which will involve the deployment of the ‚Äústraight-line mode‚Äù (low drag) and the ‚Äúcornering mode‚Äù (high downforce). In addition, there will be three pre-season tests of three days each for the 2026 season to account for the new power units that will be adopted.\n \n>The 2026 Financial Regulations (Section D) have built on the experience gained by the FIA, Formula 1 and the teams since the first introduction of Financial Regulations in 2021. Significant effort has been made to simplify the regulations by changes in the perimeter of exclusions and adjustment methodologies and to strengthen measures available to FIA to monitor compliance to the Financial Regulations. The overall level of the cost cap has remained ‚Äì in effect ‚Äì equivalent to the current levels, while the changes to the actual number reflect the changes to exclusion and adjustment perimeter and the effect of cumulative inflation.\n \n> Further elements will be submitted to the World Council for approval in the coming months to complete the regulation package for 2026, while refinements to the already approved sections will continue with the collaboration between the FIA, FOM and the Formula 1 teams.\n\n>**Regulatory updates**          \n>**FIA Formula One World Championship**\n \n>Minor changes for 2024 and 2025 Sporting and Technical regulations were approved by the World Council, including the removal of the point awarded for setting the fastest lap and the increase in requirement for fielding a young driver during free practice from once per season to two times per season.', 'Doesn‚Äôt this say that teams will have to do four rookie practice sessions next year, not remove the requirement completely like people were reporting earlier?', ""It looks like somebody messed up when they tweeted about the rookie sessions.

I pulled a few different regulatory eras and tried to look at the third year of relatively stable rules, like we have now (except 2012, when I just went for the competitive 4th season).

I looked at number of winning cars and drivers, gap between the top 3 in the WDC (percentage of leaders points P3 has) and the gap between the entire field in qualifying. (I excluded any obviously erroneous results such as vastly different weather between Q1 and Q3 or cars multiple seconds away from the pack). **All data was taken for first 16 races only to make it measurable between seasons.**

|Era/Year|# Winning Teams|#Winning Drivers|Gap Between Top 3|Gap Between 1st and last Quali|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Ground Effect - 2024|4|7|72%|2.45s|
|V6 Turbo - 2016|2|4|71%|4.68s|
|KERS - 2012|4|7|78%|6.14s|
|3l V10 - 2002|3|4|35%|4.94s|
|No Driver Aids - 1996|3|4|61%|6.57s|
|Ground Effect Ban - 1986|4|5|96%|10.56s|

This season looks to be up there on all metrics apart from gap between the top 3 in the table at this stage of the season.

But what is staggering is how tight the whole field is compared to any other era, I saw some people calling Sauber ""a joke"" in another thread and this proves just how good of a job Sauber are doing compared to backmarkers of yore. The gap between P20 and P1 in Bahrain this year would have put you 6th on the grid in 1986's opener.","[""Sauber being a joke is definitely relative. They're a joke because week after week, even though their qualifying time is less than 2 seconds. They still manage to finish 19th 20th almost every race. \n\nIn the past you had back markers that couldn't even finish 80% of races. In 2020-2022 Haas was finishing almost a minute behind 18th.

But the fact that they're able to finish races and don't trigger the 107% rule on their own makes them a step up compared to the backmarkers of yore."", 'I don\'t know. Sure. If you look at performance on lap time or race time, Sauber is undeniably better than say Minardi, or Caterham, or Super Aguri.\n\nBut let\'s take it to an example (that I know about sorry if it loses you) in competitive Smash Brothers tournaments. What\'s a worse fate. Going to a super major (an event where the best players in the world attend) and coming dead last.
