I thought it'd be fun to do a deep dive on what changes and clarifications had to be made solely because of him:

*edit: added rule changes 11, 12 and 13, thanks to those who pointed them out!*

*edit: several people requested I make a similar list for Lewis Hamilton. I'll post it tomorrow.*

- - - 

**1. Minimum Age Requirement for F1 Super Licence**

Race: -

Incident: Max Verstappen was signed by Toro Rosso for the 2015 season at just 16 years old, making his F1 debut at 17 years and 166 days—the youngest driver in Formula 1 history.

Rule Change: The FIA introduced new Super Licence requirements effective from the 2016 season. Drivers must be at least 18 years old to be eligible, have accumulated at least 40 points over the previous three seasons in specified lower categories, and have completed a minimum number of kilometers in testing, along with holding a valid road driver's licence.

**2. The ""Verstappen Rule"" – Moving Under Braking**

Race: 2016 Japanese Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen aggressively defended against Lewis Hamilton by moving under braking into the chicane, forcing Hamilton to take evasive action.

Rule Change: The FIA prohibited drivers from changing direction under braking in a way that could cause an avoidable collision. Drivers must not move unpredictably or change direction under braking when defending, and must leave at least one car's width between their own car and the edge of the track when defending.

**3. Expansion of the ""Verstappen Rule"" – Dangerous Defensive Maneuvers**

Race: 2016 Belgian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen made aggressive defensive moves against Kimi Räikkönen, including moving under braking and weaving on straights, leading to safety concerns.

Rule Change: The FIA expanded the rule to penalize any dangerous defensive maneuvers. Drivers are not allowed to make more than one change of direction to defend a position. Any movement that impedes another driver in a dangerous manner is prohibited, and stewards were given increased authority to penalize unsportsmanlike conduct.

**4. Use of Alternate Lines and Track Limits**

Race: 2017 United States Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen overtook Kimi Räikkönen for third place on the final lap by going off-track and cutting inside the track limits at Turn 17.

Rule Clarification: The FIA provided clarifying definitions of track limits and enforced consistent penalties. The track is defined by the white lines; drivers must keep at least one wheel within these lines at all times. Overtaking or gaining a lasting advantage by leaving the track is prohibited. Stewards were instructed to apply penalties uniformly for track limit violations.

**5. Driver Conduct and Physical Altercations**

Race: 2018 Brazilian Grand Prix

Incident: After a collision with Esteban Ocon, Verstappen confronted and physically pushed Ocon multiple times in the FIA weigh-in area.

Rule Change: The FIA strengthened regulations against unsportsmanlike conduct off the track. Drivers must conduct themselves professionally and with respect. Physical altercations can result in penalties such as community service, fines, or suspension, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the sport's integrity.

**6. Formation Lap Overtaking Clarification**

Race: 2021 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton during the formation lap before the race start.

Rule Clarification: The FIA clarified rules regarding formation lap conduct. Drivers must maintain their grid positions during the formation lap unless a car is delayed leaving the grid. Overtaking is only permitted if a car is delayed and others cannot avoid passing it without unduly delaying the remainder of the field. Procedures were clarified to ensure all drivers understand acceptable behavior before the race start.

**7. Clarification on Forcing a Driver Off-Track**

Race: 2021 Brazilian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen defended his position by pushing Lewis Hamilton wide at Turn 4, causing both cars to leave the track.

Rule Clarification: The FIA issued clearer guidelines on overtaking and defending. If an overtaking car is significantly alongside, the defending driver must leave at least one car's width of space. Drivers must not deliberately force another driver off the track. Detailed criteria were provided for stewards to assess incidents consistently.

**8. Technical Regulations on Rear Wings and Parc Fermé**

Race: 2021 Brazilian Grand Prix

Incident: After qualifying, Verstappen touched and inspected Hamilton's rear wing in parc fermé conditions.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced rules regarding parc fermé conditions. Drivers and team personnel are prohibited from touching or examining rival cars during parc fermé. Strict penalties, including fines and sporting penalties, can be applied for violations. Security measures were enhanced, with increased monitoring and enforcement.

**9. Double Yellow Flag Compliance**

Race: 2021 Qatar Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen failed to sufficiently slow down for double-waved yellow flags during qualifying.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced the importance of yellow flag compliance. Stricter penalties were introduced for Verstappen's failing to respect yellow flags.

**10. Brake Testing and Sudden Deceleration**

Race: 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen braked suddenly in front of Hamilton while attempting to let him pass, leading to a collision.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced rules against dangerous driving behaviors. Sudden deceleration or ""brake testing"" that endangers other drivers is strictly prohibited. Procedures for safely yielding positions were clarified, including proper communication protocols between teams and race control. Stricter penalties were introduced to deter such actions.

**11. Restrictions on Post-Race Celebrations and dangerous driving over the Finish Line**
 
(*edit - suggested by /u/SomewhereAlarmed9985)*

Race: 2021 Styrian Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen slowed down and performed burnouts or drifted over the finish line to celebrate his victory, which was deemed potentially dangerous.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced regulations prohibiting dangerous driving after the chequered flag, including burnouts and drifting over the finish line. Drivers are required to proceed safely to parc fermé after finishing the race. Post-race celebrations must not endanger other drivers, marshals, or spectators.

**12. Safety Car Restart Procedure Change**

Race: 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix

Incident: Verstappen often drew alongside the car ahead during safety car restarts, notably during the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix where he pulled alongside Lewis Hamilton before the restart.

Rule Change: The FIA updated the safety car restart procedures:
Drivers must remain in a single line without overlapping until the race resumes.
Overtaking or drawing alongside another car before crossing the start/finish line after the safety car has pulled into the pits is prohibited.
Drivers cannot gain an advantage by positioning themselves alongside the car ahead during a restart.


**13. Clarification of Pitlane Exit Rules**

(*edit- suggested by user /u/Buffythedragonslayer)

Race: 2023 Monaco Grand Prix

Incident: During the race, Max Verstappen appeared to cross the pit exit line when rejoining the track, leading to controversy over whether he violated the rules.

Rule Clarification: The FIA tweaked the pitlane exit rules to clarify that drivers must not cross any part of their car over the pit exit line when rejoining the track. The updated rule specifies that touching or crossing the line with any part of the car constitutes a violation.

While some or all of those may be true at times. Its another things to actively give the people who believe that ammunition. \n\n  \nMy wife was a casual observer of the race and even she was confused on exactly why Lando was penalized. Esepcially in the context of me explaining to her why George Russell was penalized with Bottas earlier. \n\nIt just makes it so anyone who isn't in the thick of this sport to feel like there are no rules and everything has a degree of fixing to make sure certain players do well which isn't true but the optics are everything sometimes.  Especially when you are trying to reach new people, just not appease people who are already invested."", ""The defending car should never be allowed to push the attacker off track when they don't make the corner themselves. It is stupid in every angle. It ruins championship fights, because the one in the lead can simply drive like it's bumper cars, since they will still have the upper hand if both of them crash out of the race. We saw this to the extreme in Brazil 21 and after, where Lewis had to actively dodge Max every single time or they'd both crash because Max was given zero reason to care by the rules. That in itself is a massive flaw in the rulebook, it needs action ASAP.\n\nI want to watch skillful fights within the track limits.

That is against the very fabric of the sport. \n\nDoing it in wheel to wheel racing is clearly a different kettle of fish to doing it on a flying lap as it created a situation for Lando to choose between crashing into Max or leaving the track.\n\nThat’s the reason it caused such an uproar in Brazil 2021 and such an uproar here (as well as the context of it happening in a championship battle). \n\nI just can’t see why anyone would want a rule that ENCOURAGES drivers to leave the track without consequence', ""1. Lando was wrong to overtake off the track. That is a penalty unless the position is given back. No problems here.\n\n2. Max was wrong to defend his position off track. Making it impossible to him to make the corner and even allowing Lando to make the corner. Max arrived out of control seem as he also left the track, which again is against the rules. That should have applied to a penalty here. \n\n3. Rules need to amended to stop what Max did. Drivers should be able to defend the entire track if they can stay on the track. If there is a wall or gravel trap, then Max wouldn't have done what he did as he would have crashed. \n\n4. This would not have been a problem if Lando would have given the position back, then tried the overtake again on the next lap."", 'SIMPLE SOLUTION!\n\nIf two cars are halfway alongside each other at the apex, both must leave enough space—one car width—for the other to make the turn.
