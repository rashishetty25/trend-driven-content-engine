1gdmdh8,Isn't Verstappen the real winner here?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gdmdh8/isnt_verstappen_the_real_winner_here/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gdmdh8/isnt_verstappen_the_real_winner_here/,2024-10-27,0 days,"Controversial, but honest opinion. Given Lando's pace at the end, the time loss against Verstappen, and any potential damage, it's not unreasonable to think Norris could have won this race with Verstappen 4th, behind the two Ferraris and Lando. If this happened, Verstappen would have dropped 13 points. Instead, he loses just 10 points to Lando. I appreciate it's not a huge difference, but it makes me wonder if it was part of his mindset going into this race.

Edit: I know we saw similar with Hamilton in 2021 as well. Should this lead to discussions about the time of penalties awarded? Should time penalties be served sooner (like the old 3 laps to serve a stop/go), should you be allowed to change tires at the same time? Ultimately, it feels wrong to see things like this go virtually unpunished, and almost rewarded. ","['It is definitely why he didn‚Äôt give the place up. And it was probably a good trade, as would be a double DNF from his perspective.', ""Max's plan has clearly been to race Lando and only Lando for a while, I don't think it was quite so methodical though, he just knows that if he does everything he can to keep Lando behind him he'll 100% end up on top in the end"", 'He probably thought he would have gotten a 10 second total penalty from that affair and that he could recover to P4. So he definetly did worse than he could have, but your math does check out.', 'I mean yeah, could‚Äôve definitely turned out like this. Like Lando said before, Max doesn‚Äôt care where he finishes, as long as he makes it as hard as possible for Lando', ""Tbf I think Red Bull fucked up pitting Max so early whilst he was holding up Lando. If they held on a little bit longer, Lando would've finished P3."", ""It's arguable whether he would have caught Sainz without being held up, but it was clear that his priority was fucking Norris race at all costs and he was happy to crash as long as it was with Lando"", 'I agree; not giving back the position probably did keep Norris from having enough laps to win by the end, whilst only costing himself 1 place at most, given that Max still gets at least one of his penalties, and he probably realised he was getting at least one penalty.', ""Max's only objective is to make life hell for Lando. Lando needs to finish the races, Max doesn't. If they crash out, so be it and you can see that in his driving.

By now, there shouldn't be any smidgen of doubt that RB needs to part with Checo Perez.
He is not able to extract any sort of performance from the RB20.
It's getting ridiculous how big the gap has become with Max... and the rest of the field.

Realistically, I think there's only two options: either promote Lawson or Tsunoda to RB.
Tsunoda in that respect is, although talented,  bit erratic in his driving as of late.
Lawson on the other might be the best choice IMO. Of course he's not that experienced yet (so there's always the danger of a Gasly, Kvyat or Albon scenario at RB), but he drives calmly and smart.

A swap with one of them is not an option I think for Perez. That would be an embarrassment, frankly.

1gdpum1,Red Bull using both of its teams again...,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gdpum1/red_bull_using_both_of_its_teams_again/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gdpum1/red_bull_using_both_of_its_teams_again/,2024-10-28,0 days,"So, today on lap 67 or 68 if I remember correctly, Lando Norris was still holding the Fastest Lap which would get him an extra point. Then, misteriously, Liam Lawson is called to pit and along with a new wing (due to damage from a collision with Colapinto) they put him on softs and send him to try for the Fastest Lap.

Lawson, if I'm not mistaken, is driving for VCARB, a team that's not fighting for championship points and won't benefit in any form from a change in the Constructor's Championship standings. He also wouldn't get the point for Fastest Lap since he was 17th at this point in the race. Seems like the only objective was to take away that point from Norris/McLaren.

1 lap later, the Red Bull people seem to have realized they made a mistake (or maybe the radio connection between RB and VCARB was down, who knows) and promptly send Checo to pit for softs and try for the Fastest Lap, which makes complete sense since RB is fighting for the Championship and any point they can take away from McLaren or Ferrari is vital.

Am I the only one thinking this is a load of horseshit? I know I might sound like a Karen and it's not the first time Red Bull does something like this but this one was very blatant, and it had the awful side effect of putting Checo dead last in his home race (it's not like he was in a good position before, but he finished LAST, lol) I know it's a competition and no one wants to lose and there's money involved yadda yadda but c'mon, if it's gonna be like this just run a 4-car team and call it a day.","[""If he's getting a new front wing he may as well get new tires, and what tires did you expect them to put on at that point in the race?
