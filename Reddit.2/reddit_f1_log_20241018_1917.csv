The Finn is waiting for Sauber/Audi's decision and is also preparing to not have a cockpit next year\n\n(Motorsport-Total.com) - Who will be in the Sauber cockpit in 2025? Even before this weekend's US Grand Prix in Austin (Texas), the driver question for next year is still unresolved. Even Valtteri Bottas, who is actually considered a hot candidate, seems to be increasingly preoccupied with this - and above all unsettled!\n\nValtteri Bottas is waiting for the decision from Sauber/Audi\n\n‘I had said that I hoped everything would be sorted out by Austin, but I'm still waiting for the final decisions,’ said Bottas, who apparently can't explain why he doesn't yet have a contract for next year in his pocket. ‘I think Mattia \\[Binotto, team principal\\] should answer that question rather than me.’\n\n‘It's out of my hands,’ says the Finn, who “can't do anything at the moment” except wait and see. ‘Of course, I'm trying to do my best this week and hope that lifts the mood. That's the state of things. We've been in contact every week. I know the conditions I'm getting into and I'm just waiting for the green light.’\n\nBottas: ‘There is a risk of not having a cockpit’\n\nThe Sauber driver was unable to say how long the decision would take on Thursday ahead of the US GP. ‘A month ago, we were told as soon as possible,’ recalls Bottas, who will “hopefully soon” receive an answer regarding his future in Formula 1. ‘Of course, there will also be a deadline from my side at some point.’\n\nThe big question: Who will be in the Sauber cockpit in 2025?\n\nIf the 240-time GP starter wants to look outside Formula 1 or take on another role in the premier class, he should make a decision in the coming weeks. ‘Christmas is coming soon, and there will be no vacancies anywhere,’ warns the otherwise relaxed Finn.\n\nBottas, who has been driving in Formula 1 since 2013 and has celebrated ten Grand Prix victories to date, is therefore also worried that he will no longer have a cockpit next year. ‘In the situation I'm in now, with only one free seat, there is of course a risk,’ admits the 35-year-old honestly.\n\nMoney ‘shouldn't be the problem’\n\nHowever, Bottas rules out the possibility that it could be down to him asking for too much money, for example, because ‘that shouldn't be an issue. I think the conditions we are talking about are as they should be and I think Audi should have the budget, at least that's what they say. So I don't think that should be a problem.’\n\nAfter all, he has ‘already built up a good relationship with Mattia’ and talked about both his future and the plans for 2025. ‘I've been told everything so far,’ reveals the current Sauber driver, who also knows that Sauber/Audi has other options for 2025.\n\n‘I love Formula 1 and I want to drive in Formula 1. It's obviously a bit of a strange situation, but that's the way it is,’ explains Bottas, who has “had a lot of time to think about different things over the past three weeks, but is always positive”.\n\nValtteri Bottas ‘remains positive’\n\n‘I will remain positive,’ says the Finn, who says there is not much more he can do than perform on the track and continue to work on success with the team. However, this is not easy, because ‘if you don't have the car, it's really difficult to show what you can do’.\n\n‘And the people who make decisions also tend to look at the results,’ fears the 35-year-old. ‘It's not easy to shine at the moment, but I just have to trust Mattia. I just have to trust that he knows what he's getting from me.’\n\n‘I feel and believe that I should have this cockpit and that it's the best thing for the team,’ says Bottas optimistically ahead of the Grand Prix in Austin.

These changes will possibly not be an exhaustive list. 

***

# [2024 Technical Regulations](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_technical_regulations_-_issue_8_-_2024-10-17.pdf)

- The only change is Mule Car Rims being added to the table in Appendix 5 which defines the classification of components for Formula One cars and support equipment. 

***

# [2025 Sporting Regulations](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2025_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_2_-_2024-10-17.pdf)

- As stated by the FIA the entire section in regards to the fastest lap point has been removed.

- A change stating that Competitors may not have or use more than 1 car for the purpose of Testing Previous Cars (TPC). It also defines what a day is when Testing Previous Cars (a single 9 hour period between 09:00 & 19:00). This testing is limited to Grade 1/1T circuits and may not take place on a circuit hosting a championship round:
  1. 60 days prior to it hosting that race        
  2. If the Circuit did not host a race in the year falling immediately prior to the year of the championship      
  3. If the circuit is deemed to have undergone significant modification following the relevant race in the year falling immediately prior to the year of the championship     

- They can only complete a maximum of 20 days of TPC in each calendar year. And may only complete a maximum of 1000 km of TPC in each calendar year with drivers entered into the championship. And that can only be accumulated over a maximum of 4 days of that allowed 20 days of TPC.

- The requirements for *conditions of poor visibility* have been removed from the section in regards to disabling the DRS. It is now entirely up to the race director's discretion as to turning it off or on.

- As stated it is now required on 2 occasions during the championship for each car entered into the championship to use a rookie driver

- It is now formally written that should either qualifying session not happen then the grid for the sprint race or the main race will be based upon the Driver's Championship classification. The standard procedure for forming the grid in regards to penalties etc will be applied to that classification. If for whatever reason that method of forming the grid cannot be applied it shall be at the sole discretion of the stewards as to how the grid will be formed. 

- There is a clarification that if you wish to do multiple reconnaissance laps you must you use pit entry road when you wish to enter the pit lane to do so.

***

# 2026 [Sporting](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2026_f1_regulations_-_section_b_sporting_-_iss01_-_2024-10-17.pdf), [Technical](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2026_f1_regulations_-_section_c_technical_-_iss09_-_2024-10-17.pdf) & [Financial](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2026_f1_regulations_-_section_d_financial_-f1_teams_-_iss01_-_2024-10-17.pdf) Regulations

These are harder to write out the difference as it is quite a significant change to the regulations and more significantly they have also completely rewritten the regulations from the ground up and given them a brand new easy to read format.          
The Sporting, Technical & Financial Regulations are now split into Sections B, C & D respectively with article codes including those letters for easy cross referencing (Although they have forgotten to do this with the Financial Regulations....).

You will note there is no Section A. I believe this is because the Sporting Regulations no longer include any of the regulations in regards to the Governance of the sport, the General Undertaking of said regulations, certain bits on licences or indeed how points are awarded. I assume this section will come later.

Because of all of this it's hard to pinpoint changes, some things of note that immediately jumped out though:

- Qualifying or Practice sessions are now defined as LTCS or Lap Time Classified Sessions. Race sessions are defined as TTCS or Total Time Classified Sessions

- A whole bunch of factors in regards to the energy deployment for the Override Mode will be defined by the FIA on a race by race basis and announced 4 weeks prior to each competition. These factors include:        
  1. The maximum electrical power of the ERS-K, as a function of car speed, when the Override mode is **NOT** active        
  2. The maximum electrical power of the ERS-K, as a function of car speed, when the Override mode is active        
  3. The maximum energy that can be harvested on a single lap, when the Override mode is **NOT** active        
  4. The maximum energy that can be harvested on a single lap, when the Override mode is active when the driver crosses the line at the start of the lap       
  5. The time gap between the car in front in the detection zone so as to active the Override Mode      
  6. The position of the Detection Line       
  7. The position of the Activation Line       

I'm very sure there is significantly more that can be found and looked over.

Up until that moment, Norris would win by one point.

Then, Red Bull call Perez in to get fresh rubber. The mexican fall off the Top 5 (hell, if there was a Safety Car during the race, he could even get out of the Top 10).

And then, on the last lap, while everybody thought that Norris won, Perez set the Fastest Lap, take away Lando's extra point and Verstappen wins the championship in a tie-breaker 'cause he had more wins.
