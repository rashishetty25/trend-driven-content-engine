What have I seen of Vasseur's Ferrari? What have I seen of Ferrari, he hasn't revolutionised anything'.\n\nMattia Binotto, former Ferrari team principal: ‚ÄòI'm taking Audi to F1.

It's the fascination of the challenge'. Mattia Binotto, former Ferrari team principal, in his first interview as head of Audi's F1 programme talks about the excitement of starting again at the age of 54.\n\n**From Maranello to Hinwil, home of Sauber (taken over by Audi). What has he found and what is missing?**\n\n'Two different realities, even the ranking says so. The difference is immense, in everything from size to instruments. But I find so many similarities with the Ferrari of my beginnings, in 1995. A company where everything had to be built or rebuilt. In those days, in addition to reorganising departments and methodology, you had to train people to win. Inculcate the mentality of ‚Äòwe are not here to participate‚Äô‚Äô.\n\n**Why at the age of 54, after having been team principal at Ferrari, did you start again from the bottom?**\n\n‚ÄòPrecisely because I was starting from a blank sheet of paper. In the 18 months I spent away from racing I missed the competition, being part of a team, sharing fatigue, ambitions and goals. Having the desire to start again, the only attractive challenge for me was Audi, the most ambitious one. It would have made no sense to join a team that already works. Here, instead, I can build, I relive part of my past and that is also why it is fascinating.\n\n**What are the priorities in the Audi programme?**\n\n‚ÄòTo be in F1 (the official entry will be in 2026 ed.), to stay there for a long time to create a winning team and to become a technical reference. We are at the beginning of the climb, in front is Everest and now we can only see the base. We are deciding which side to climb from, it is important to establish a route'.\n\n**Where does one start?**\n\n‚ÄòWe have to work on the company itself, on size, on culture. If we compare ourselves with our adversaries we have about 400 people less, we have to add them to be able to compete at the same level. Our choice is to invest in young people'.\n\n**‚ÄòMick Schumacher is an option‚Äô.**\n\n**Drivers: taken Hulkenberg, when will you decide on the second?**\n\n‚ÄòWe can afford the luxury of not being in a hurry, as all the other teams have decided on their line-up. There are two essential aspects: on the one hand, experience to set the path of growth. On the other, a young, talented player to accompany us on the path to the top.\n\n**Is Mick Schumacher an option?**\n\n‚ÄòDefinitely, we are evaluating him. I've met him and spoken to him, I've known him for a long time having been part of the Ferrari Driver Academy. I know the merits and advantages of him, he's one of the names we have in mind'.\n\n**He has taken Jonathan Wheatley, a pillar of Red Bull. He too is starting from scratch. Why does a team that used to win everything now no longer win and lose such important figures?**\n\n‚ÄòHappy with Jonathan's arrival, we have travelled a similar path in different teams. His signing is an important signal, if he came to us it's because he has guarantees. As for Red Bull, well cycles have a beginning and an end, they always have in F1. I think Red Bull is at the end'."", 'Is this the same Binotto that refused to make Leclerc the #1 option in 2022 despite him being the clear superior Ferrari driver?', ""He can have his opinions. I actually agree with most of what he says. But I don't get what he gains from making comments like the ones about Hamilton and Leclerc.\n\nHis management of the team in 2022 was atrocious.

The Key Points was the new Rules are too complex, Engine too reliant on Chassis design and reloading the Battery. Customers Team will get the Engines Layout way too late and will be compromised alot. 

They also talked this with Fred Vasseur about this and he confirmed that customers Team won't have a Chance in the new Rules. Renault Vyril PU Engineers also this to Renault CEO.

Aston Martin knew this from the beginning and signed with Honda.

So what option does McLaren have now? 



","['I‚Äôm pretty sure that part of the deal to keep McLaren at Mercedes was that they get to be in the room when the engine is being developed. The threat from RBPT was that big at the time that Mercedes gave away the advantage they would have had over McLaren.\n\nEDIT: [here‚Äôs an article about it.](https://speedcafe.com/mclaren-influence-mercedes-engine-development-2026/)', ""So generally this has been common wisdom in F1 and why generally the top 3-4 teams will always be a works team and why that is a very coveted seat to fill.\n\nIt's why the McHonda disaster happened in the first place and why RB-Renault relations have always been strained especially since Renault re-entered the sport (and subsequently flopped hard in the hybrid era).\n\nHOWEVER, teams are not nearly secretive as before and particularly Mercedes have had better collaboration with customers than you would see historically from engine manufacturers. secondly, the FIA during the early days of the hybrid era has slammed down on special engine maps only available to works teams i.e 'Party Mode' and we will expect to see parity from the software side now too.\n\nIt does however limit designers especially people like Newey who design the car wholistically and would like to have a say on engine dimensions/packaging to suit his Aero needs. On this part customer teams have their hands tied a bit.\n\nIt's not a silver bullet tho and imo short term customer teams with good engines will have better luck than works teams with bad engines."", 'No\n\nMcLaren will be a VIP customer (or customer with some advantages in the engine development process) so they could be like Force India or Williams in 2014-16 (with better economics).', 'I think McLaren, a customer team, is a contender until proven otherwise.', ""It will be much harder for them than compared to today, where the engine freeze and rules around ICE mode parity make it fairer.\n\nFor the 2026 rules, I believe they've put in some rules to ensure that customer teams get the same engine modes and things like that. The challenge, as you've alluded to, is around cooling and packing. The cooling requirement for the next gen battery is going to be significant. I suspect the manufacturers will have some kind of immediate advantage, albeit smaller than what we saw with the current ones."", ""Absolutely! Things are always up in the air when it comes to new regulations, but this should be the most level playing field during a regulations change in F1 history.\n\n7 teams will have similar facilities, workforces and be running at the cost cap. The manufactrers PU development is being done under a cost cap and there are strict regulations regarding supply parity, engine modes, mounting points and dissemination of information through the homologation dossier. None of those things were true at any point in the past, especially in 2014. This is by design, the regulations have been crafted to ensure that you can compete as a customer on a level playing field.\n\nAdd to that, Williams and Mclaren made sure that they had access and input to Mercedes PU design in their PU deals, which means that they likely won't have much, if any penalty from being a customer.\n\nIn fact, that could be our best shot at a super close championship in '26. If the Merc is (as expected) the best PU, having 4 teams that could compete at the front is pretty exciting."", 'Red Bull and Mclaren have both won titles as customer cars.', ""Mercedes and McLaren negotiated a deal for 2026-onward which gives McLaren a seat at the table in PU design so they have input and always know exactly what's going on with the engine, allowing them to effectively design their car around the PU instead of designing their car then buying the PU afterwards.\n\nThat makes them a pseudo-works team, and yeah, means their status as a customer team shouldn't matter nor hold them back in 2026. TBH this is what the rules should force engine suppliers to do for customer teams they provide their engines to, for the good of the sport.\n\nThe other customer teams as far as I know don't have this benefit and are mostly blind to how their engines will perform relative to the chassis, so they'll probably struggle a bit at the beginning of the regulations."", 'The cost cap still exists.']",260,56,2024-10-13 16:26:32, Discussion,0,0

Of course I am just manually looking, so there‚Äôs no adjustment for track length or anything.

But i was writing out what they usually are and i noticed something sort of interesting (doesn‚Äôt hold any actual importance though)

Charles has out-qualified Carlos by a  margin of 1-0.05 (in terms of a tenth) 6 times with 3 being under .10

And he‚Äôs out-qualified him by a margin of over 2 and a quarter tenths 7 times, 4 being over 3 and a half tenths

But he‚Äôs never out qualified Carlos within the range of 1 tenth to 2.25.
If you found the average of the usual gap Charles out-qualifies Carlos by it‚Äôs probably somewhere between this 2 numbers, but yet he‚Äôs never actually been in those numbers.

 You‚Äôd think that would be the most common gap, but instead either Charles is dominating or it‚Äôs insanely close.

Carlos‚Äôs gaps to Charles when he‚Äôs out qualified are more normal even with only 6 values.

It does probably hurt Charles if people find their average gap using the median, because their (unadjusted inaccurate just the physical numbers of the gaps) median difference

is +0.37 to Charles
but to the Charles side of that the numbers are 
+.73, +1, +2.25, +2.48, +2.63, + 3.54

and to Carlos side 
+0.08, +0.06, +0.05, -0.06, -1.04, -1.93

I just thought it was interesting how many times Charles and Carlos were neck and neck in qualifying and also how many times Carlos wasn‚Äôt really close at all and yet there was somehow never a middle ground between that ","[""If Sainz is on his best and Leclerc is not, they're very close, and Carlos can eek out a win.

1g2i75w,Prema struggles logic ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g2i75w/prema_struggles_logic/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g2i75w/prema_struggles_logic/,2024-10-13,0 days,"Prema has been regarded as the best F3/F2 team to be in up untill this year. In 2024 Prema  isn't as good and it has been generally accepted opinion that because of Prema struggles their drivers who both got promoted to F1 can't show their true potential. Reasoning behind their promotions is for Antonelli: impressive F4 and FRECA career and beating Bearman. For Bearman is his P3 as a rookie in F3 and P6 as a rookie in F2 last year and his Jeddah stint for now he is 13th in F2 standings.
I have genuine questions about ""Prema is shit argument"".

- Firstly F2 is supposed to have equal cars so weren't people upset with Prema being the best or one of the best team in recent years as it gives some drivers with usually more money an unfair advantage? Like right now some people seem almost annoyed that Prema is not as good as last year. It literally means that their drivers don't have an advantage over others anymore. And imo Prema is still like in top 5 teams.

I must say it but both current Prema drivers has been talked as a 'next F1 stars' and has been fan favourites long before this year. Antonelli's hype as a next Merc driver started after he won F4s and FRECA and Bearman was already reserve driver for Ferrari this year. Also it is not hard to notice that both Kimi and Ollie come from very wealthy families and have connections (especially Kimi's dad). With Prema past reputation I can somewhat see it as a golden ticket in feeder series only for the most priviliged.

- Second question: If we accept ""because of Prema struggles drivers can't show their full  potential"" logic. We should also acknowledge that in the past Prema drivers could look better than they really were but nobody is using this logic in reverse. Bearman accomplished P3 in F3 and P6 in F2 with Prema when they were arguably one of the best teams. Why everybody put all the blame on Prema for Bearman poor performance (plus a bit of bad luck) this year but nobody  acknowleges that he had some team advantage in 2022 and 2023 which could influence his standings? ","[""Prema drivers generally have high budget. High budget drivers have new chassis and parts whenever they need them, which is always an advantage over drivers with three or more year old chassis cobbled together with repaired parts. (Of course, there are high budget drivers on other teams too.) This year, however, everyone started F2 with a fresh, brand new chassis. So that part is equal. This year in F2 they also couldn't rely on data that the drivers the years before gathered, so it was all on current drivers and current engineers. And Bearman clearly had his head and heart in F1 for the whole year, and F2 was an afterthought. And Antonelli split some of his time too. Driving multiple vehicles is difficult. It really doesn't help when the more experienced driver has quite possibly had an F1 contract all year and known that F2 was a formality for extra track time."", '>I have genuine questions about ""Prema is shit argument"".\n\nIf you look at all of their results in all of the series that they participate in and have participated in, Formula 2 is one of their worst series. Their reputation is built on success in the lower tiers of the support categories. And it\'s not just a 2024 problem, either -- they are wildly inconsistent. Look at their 2019 season, when they finished *ninth* overall. In eight years of Formula 2, they\'ve won the teams\' championship twice and finished second twice. Compare that to six years for Formula 3, where they have won the teams\' championship five times and finished second in the other. Or six years in Formula Regional Europe, where they have five teams\' titles and one third place. Or eleven years of Italian Formula 4, where they have eight teams\' titles and three second places.', ""Literally everyone who follows the feeder series uses this logic in reverse. Look back at any threads regarding Mick's junior career."", 'People interpret things the way they want to with their bias. \n\nIf driver they like wins it‚Äôs their skill and incredibleness. If driver they like is doing badly it‚Äôs the team. \n\nIf driver they like is in a fast car, it‚Äôs because of his technical knowledge and set up knowledge helping push the team forward. If a driver they like is in a bad car, it‚Äôs because they team  don‚Äôt know how to develop or set up their car. \n\nIf a driver they like is rude and loud it‚Äôs because he has personality and is a character which is missing from PR drilled drivers these days. If it‚Äôs a driver you hate doing the same thing, he‚Äôs just rude and disrespectful.', ""So because it was a new regulations/car change for f2, some teams got new set ups right immediately and some teams didn't. Just because the cars are more equal does not mean that set up does not matter. Prema got it wrong and it remained wrong for much of the first half of the season and thus their drivers really did not have a shot. Think of it like aston martin that one year where they got it right and were getting podiums and then boom they got it wrong and were suddenly nowhere again. That happens in Motor sport. \n\nIn Ollie's case people give him the benefit of the doubt not only because he has proved not once but twice now that he can succeed in an f1 car but also because he was flat out good last year. He got literally everything you can get in baku last year including pole lap with a broken steering column so his steering wheel wasn't straight. Two things could have happened from last year to this year one he suddenly fell off considerably (which we know is not true from his f1 performances) or two prema fell off hard which is what fans have decided is true and clearly the teams agree to based on his and kimi's promotions. \n\nPrema should have been a team capable of fighting for the championship this year but they aren't they got their act together way to late this year (and in ollie's case it doesn't help for his f2 campaign that he got pulled from two of his best tracks including one of the few early races prema looked decent in and that he had a pole for) making a title run basically impossible so then you judge the drivers based on what they can get out of the car. Its like f1 no one is saying that a williams driver should be regularly winning races the car is just not there so they don't expect it. Prema is a midfield team this year and expectations seem to have been adjusted accordingly.\n\nAs for Ollie taking F2 less seriously, overall pretty much knew from the start of the year he was being promoted. He had 6 FP1s with Haas scheduled BEFORE he got the call up in Jeddah. You don't get 6 FPs announced at a single team and a single team that is NOT your driver academy's team at the very beginning of the year unless you are getting the seat. Then Jeddah happened and I am pretty sure he was told to no longer worry about placing super high in F2...which is fair considering he just had a pole and likely a pretty high finish taken away from him he lost a full weekend of points which with only 14 weekends creates a pretty difficult gap to close AND he just proved he could race in F1 on one of the hardest tracks of the year which honestly is worth more to teams than a good f2 showing because nothing proves you can drive in f1 like driving in f1. So even if it was not announced until his future home race at silverstone Ollie was almost certainly given the handshake that he was getting the seat after Jeddah. And once you have the seat your focus turns to how to best prep for f1 which includes doing your best in fps even if it compromises your f2 races. \n\nTLDR: Either Prema shit the bed this year and thus the results are not representative of the drivers or two very talented drivers forgot how to drive this year and in ollie's case we know the second is not true so it has to be the first and people are acting accordingly. People are judging Ollie off all the info available which includes his f1 stints. Is that unfair to other drivers who didn't get the chance? Maybe but luck already plays a huge role in who gets promoted. You can be super talented but if the right affiliated seat does not appear at the right time your screwed. Like Colapinto and Lawson no one was really singing their praises that they were worthy of getting a seat until they got a shot and proved they were worthy that is just how things go and Ollie probably didn't need that shot based on the number of fp1s he was already scheduled for even before Carlos' appendix decided to bounce."", 'For me it\'s all purely bias anyways. There\'s always pre-determimed favourites and if they don\'t perform as expected there\'s excuses. When a driver nobody is talking about suddenly does good, it\'s because they just inherited a rocketship. Really we can only make educated guesses.\n\nReality is we don\'t know who the best driver is because all the teams come with varying degrees of performance and we just dont know who is really doing the best job there.  This has always been the case and is a problem that goes all the way down to Karting. The rich drivers can pay for the best machinery and pay for extra testing, that makes discovering raw talent tough because the wealthier guys will always have an unfair advatange. So, for all we know the best driver in F2 could be someone in one of the underperforming teams that nobody is talking about, trying to get by on a budget. Colapinto for example was on nobodies radar until a chance drive with Williams, very likely nobody would ever be raving about him had he not been given that chance. He\'d just be seen as another ""mid"" F2 driver with no excuses to back him up, because he wasn\'t one of the pre-season favourites.\n\nPeople will say the teams have the data so know what they\'re doing. However, honestly have to question that sometimes. Its not like the teams can see what every driver is doing in detial andsee how their teams are performing. They only really know the drivers they have under them and even at that, they sometimes can make the wrong decision(Sargeant or De Vries as recent examples). Like at one point Ferrari had all the data on Antonelli in Karting but turned him down from their academy. So what did Mercedes see in Kimi that Ferrari did not? If he\'s such a star, why did Ferrari not want to back a hyper talented Italian driver. Sometimes got to question what the conditions are for making these academies. Like what constitutes performance/talent for them?', 'Overall I agree apart from Bearman argument that he had his head already in F1 from the beginning of the year. I get his Jeddah stint and FPs with Haas but other than that he had no reasons not to be focused on F2. It could only be remotely possible if he literally had his contract signed after Jeddah or somehow knew he is getting F1 seat no matter the results. And imo intentionally not focusing on your F2 career while it is his job for 2024 and there are many drivers dreaming to be in his position comes across as a bit disrespectful and entilted. That\'s why I am not buying this ""excuse"".', 'I argue totally different with Mick.\n\nAlthough he won the F2 title, he did it in about the least impressive way, being on average the 6th fastest driver in races.\n\nNothing about the team, the driver was lacklustre in winning rhe title.', 'Real world hypothetical situation here. You have a number of key projects coming up at work.\n\nYou‚Äôre unable to deliver your first project because your company hasn‚Äôt given you the correct resources (Bahrain).\n\nYou‚Äôre on course to blitz your next project but are taken off it before you can complete it because you‚Äôre asked to stand-in for a more senior co-worker who‚Äôs off sick (Jeddah).\n\nYou then come back to another project to find that again, the resources you need to complete it are lacking (Australia).\n\nAn opportunity for promotion comes up as your manager is quitting, but not for another nine months. You go for it and get the job, sign the contract, but then have to go back to your current role until then and continue to deliver your usual projects (Haas 2025).\n\nIn short, I completely understand why Bearman‚Äôs motivation may not be what it was last year.']",0,12,2024-10-13 16:26:34, Discussion,0,0

If a car relies less on clean flow to generate downforce, it also becomes less affected by dirty air. \n\nSo while dirty air doesn\'t necessarily get reduced with the introduction of a fan, it makes dirty air less of an issue. But we are not taking into account the safety issues of a fan-based car that loses a lot of grip when it goes over a bump.', 'read this and thought ""fan? yes! finally we fans can become part of the team!"" then was like oh..

1g28asn,An improvemed points system?,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g28asn/an_improvemed_points_system/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g28asn/an_improvemed_points_system/,2024-10-12,0 days,"In modern F1, with reliability so low and the gap between top 4 teams and rest being large. Therefore leading to only 2 spots for points, should they change it so teams like Haas and Williams who found themselves so often just out of the points, being able to get points. Also it would create agurably even better racing as the bottom teams already scrap hard over a p13 imagine if it was for points and how harder they'd scrap. 

My solution: points as usual for the top 4 but rest changes so 
25,18,15,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1
Plus the ability for a driver in top 15 to get fastest lap point.

P.s Also my dream world you'd get a point for pole as well as fastest lap 

So do you think it should be added if so in what capacity?","['the reliability will go down when get the  new engine rules in 2026.  one of the reasons is that cars are so reliable is the engine development freeze.', ""I don't think anything needs changing really. As many others have said in the past, points are supposed to be difficult to score.\n\nThe moment you extend the points to 15 places, why stop there, though? At that point, just go all the way and make it all finishers get something.\n\nI'm not against this either, really, it won't affect the front but would make the battle at the back more meaningful."", 'If they gave points out for all positions I would be ok with it but honestly, the current system is good the way it is.  I like a point for pole though', ""Points for 15 drivers is a rather silly suggestion.  \nThey should do away points for a fastest lap.  \nAnd why points for pole?   \nMore often than not that's the luck of the draw or the weather."", 'Oh god not again\n\nThe break is killing us', 'Maybe it‚Äôs just me being blinded by childhood nostalgia, but I really liked the 2003-2009 system (10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1).

But the teams still get prize money down to last place.\n\nHowever, in the past (prior to 2010ish iirc) Points were EXTREMELY important.  No Points, no money.  A single point meant your (freight) travel budget was paid for by FOM the following year, a big part of a small teams expenses.  But the latest concord agreement changed that a more fairer distribution model.\n\nGiving points to last place is a participation trophy.']",0,38,2024-10-13 16:26:35, Discussion,0,0
