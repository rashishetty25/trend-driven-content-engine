Not a steward that ""notes"" incidents and then refers them elsewhere.\n\nThey need a permanent steward with unilateral discretion to make immediate decisions based on their objective experience. And they need to be shielded from the politicung BS that has been typical as of late from Team Prinicpals. Their word is final.

Take the first incident, for me that is 100% unacceptable racing, Lando was absolutely entitled to space which Max never gives in that situation. \n\nBut it’s become normalised over the last few years so that half the time there is no punishment and you have lots of fans claiming that giving a penalty for it is harsh, as a result other drivers have started to do it as well. \n\nJust a really unfortunate decline in driving standards which means we get less good battles that are decided on the track and more that are decided by the stewards. Max, and the inability to police his driving is absolutely the reason for this decline.', ""I feel like if the stewards gave the penalty points he probably deserved he wouldn't be doing this. He got away with last week, fine. He got 2 points yesterday and 2 in Austria. I think he had 2 from Vegas last year.  Alonso got 3 for an incident not as bad as the second one yesterday. He easily could have gotten 3 and 2. Add in extras he got away with like Hungary and I feel like Max could easily be near a ban right now and he wouldn't be driving like a maniac. Instead hes actually nowhere close. Just hand out the points and it will help. For some reason K-mag got points for every little thing but Max isnt getting them."", ""Agree with Toto on this.

Even looking at the USA GP and Mex GP: multiple drivers we're penalized for forcing a driver off track or leaving the track and gaining an advantage, but at COTA all penalties were 5 sec. Now, Max got 10 sec (while I don't dissagree with the severity, it is inconsistent). Even within the Mexico GP: Max got 10 seconds for forcing Lando off track in Turn 4, being the defending car, whereas Perez got nothing for basically doing the same to Lawson as the overtaking car in the same corner.\n\nThat said, as for Max specifically: He is just smart. He simply knows how to use the rules to his advantage, even if that means making a 'smart foul'. Sportmanslike? Maybe not. But as long as it benefits him in terms of results (or it doesn't really hurt him in the worst case scenario), I think he will continu to exploit the regulations where it indeed is beneficial to him. And others at some point will follow his lead. You already saw drivers racing to the apex as they noticed Max did it effectively and gained an advantage by just racing to the apex.\n\nUnless this is more structurally adressed in a way where these 'fouls' do not result in a benefit (which can never be completely eliminated, but could be addressed better than this), I doubt things will change very much.\n\nI also think the penalty point race ban is pretty useless. With the exception of Magnussen (who really took the piss with the regulations on some occasions), this has never been applied. Perhaps a better approach could be to penalize repeat offenders more harshly. Forcing a driver off track? 5 seconds penalty. Do it again next week? 10 seconds. Third time? Drive through. This way you leave open the possibility of people making unintential mistakes and not having to penalize them hard, but you can impose more harsh penalties to those trying to use the regulations including limited penalties to their advantage.\n\nI also still think grid penalties should be a thing. Too often we have seen a penalized driver taking advantage of their penalty (or at least not being hurt by it) due to simply having a faster car that allowed them to open enough of a gap so the penalty won't affect the race result. Examples are Lewis at Silverstone 2021 and Max at Vegas 2023. (An example the other way around is Carlos in Australia 2023, where he got a 5 second penalty but with the safety car going to the finishline, he finished the race in P4, but with the penalty applied he dropped all the way to p12 as there was simply a que of drivers right behind him due to the safety car.)"", ""Basically saying, more than half the grid has raced like this the past years.

1gesh8a,The impact of teammates on the championship - a third of Max’s lead is down to teammate impact ,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gesh8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gesh8a/the_impact_of_teammates_on_the_championship_a/,2024-10-29,0 days,"I decided to work out how much impact Perez and Piastri have had on the WDC by taking points from their teammates and their teammates’ rivals.

It was quite striking that Max has benefited a lot more from this. Perez took 7 points off Lando early in the season, thanks to the sheer dominance of the Red Bull, the extent of which we’ve not seen replicated by McLaren later in the season. 

Oscar’s impact is the more interesting one. He’s pretty much only taken points off Max when he’s also taken points from Lando. He’s actually been a detriment to Lando. This is surprising as you would expect the McLaren to be able to deliver 1-2’s. I attribute this to a few no show weekends from Oscar leading to missed opportunities (Zandvoort, Singapore and Mexico) and Lando not having the same dominance over his teammate as Max. 

I still think we could see this trend start to reverse in the run-in. When you look at the McL’s dominance over Red Bull since summer break (notwithstanding Austin weekend), then there should be potential for Oscar to slot in between Max and Lando, also noting that McL have indicated they will use team orders.

Hope you find that interesting and welcome any thoughts ","['Arguably this kinda highlights the reasons why max will win the WDC and why McLaren will win the WCC (Sergio took no points off max, mostly due to spending most of his time racing haas and VCARB; McLaren on the other hand lost out on WDC points, but have (for the most part) 2 drivers instead of 1)', 'Sergio points from Max: 0', 'Funnily enough Oscar has been out there to race all season, that involves beating Lando. \n\nI’m not sure what point that is trying to make.', ""Just to add to the analysis though: in the case of McLaren, the other variables. It is not enough just to have a second car that could potentially finish up and down the grid, the team has to enable that, which McLaren has been uniquely very poor at doing. I'd love to know what Oscar could have done position-wise if the team was able to execute double-stack pit stops, etc. McLaren was resolute in not coordinating strategies to benefit Lando but could have positioned both better (read: ahead of Max) with a more thoughtful approach. And of course a better start to the season would have made a difference too: if a team is intent on not having a number one driver, they cannot let that driver start the year flat footed compared to the competition. I'm of the belief that the team itself handicapped Lando's WDC effort more than any other factor, and is kind of a confounding variable in your graphs."", 'It would be interesting to add Leclerc to this.', 'Perez was alive for the first few races.

Before we get started, if you missed last week’s issue [you can catch up here.](https://lastweekinformula1.substack.com/p/last-week-in-formula-1-october-14-20-2024)

If you’re a rookie ‘round these parts and wondering what you're in for, *Last Week in Formula 1* is a weekly newsletter compiling the most interesting, important, and informative goings-on in the Formula 1 world.

Every fun fact, story, and piece of news has been sourced from posts in r/formula1 (AKA: Formula 1’s publicly accessible online paddock).

Given this is The Internet, take everything you read with a grain of salt. However, after over three years of following the subreddit, there’s far more truth than lies posted—and much of the news comes from reputable sources.

On a semi-related note, like the cars we enjoy watching so much, *Last Week in Formula 1* is in a constant state of development. Any feedback you have on what’s covered, the format, or anything I missed is welcome in the comments.

# The Mexican Grand Prix



**Qualifying:**

P1. Carlos Sainz

P2. Max Verstappen

P3. Lando Norris



**Grand Prix:**

P1. Carlos Sainz

P2. Lando Norris

P3. Charles Leclerc



***LWIF1’s Reaction:***

Good lord F1 has been spicy. Unless Red Bull pulls a purple’n’blue rabbit outta their butts and manages to unlock a sizeable pace advantage over McLaren AND Ferrari *right now*, I’d wager we’re in for ever-increasing spiciness in the closing rounds. Lando’s WDC bid looks to be losing steam, at least if you consider how the amount of points he needs to gain in each race is growing rather than shrinking. Say what you will about Max’s boundary-breaking defensive tactics, but they’re proving effective—and highlighting how cunning and calculating he is… Talk about being 10/10 villain.

***Personal highlights from Mexico include:***

* The most action-packed, entertaining, dare I say *cinematic* Mexican Grand Prix in recent memory (and possibly ever?) 
* Carlos Sainz reclaiming his coveted P1 from Max with a classy overtake, then steaming off into the distance, presumably powered by chilis.  
* Contentious (and rather pissy) wheel-to-wheel action through the pack.  
* A double points finish for Haas, vaulting them into P6 in the WCC.  
* And more fuel for the driving standards fiery war of words…

\~\~\~

# The Drivers’ Mutterings & Musings

*The hottest talking point coming out of Austin and Mexico is the latest flare-up about racing standards between drivers (courtesy of Max Verstappen’s stout defensive maneuvers against Lando Norris).*

*General consensus seems that Max has been toeing the line of how the existing rules and standards are laid out—but that said existing rules and standards are part of the problem in not supporting hard and fair racing, while leaving a lot open to the interpretation of drivers and stewards alike.*

*Hence the outpouring of statements about* [*how Austin exposed the flaws in F1’s driving standards*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9cvfm/how_austin_exposed_the_flaws_in_f1s_driving/)*,* [*calls for a racing regulation overhaul*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9eo4u/jenson_button_calls_for_fia_rule_change_after/)*, and the current rules being* [*a blueprint to dissuade overtaking.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9eo4u/jenson_button_calls_for_fia_rule_change_after/)

*If you’d like to better understand these mysterious racing regulations,* [*this article courtesy of The Race is your best bet*](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/little-known-new-f1-rules-already-affecting-racing/)*, given the FIA chose not to make their 2024 regulations publicly available, unlike in years gone by.*

*Meanwhile, Mulletman Bottas has taken a simpler view,* [*claiming that some drivers are taking the piss outta the racing regulations…*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbah1i/valtteri_bottas_claims_some_drivers_taking_the_p/) *Fair enough VB!*

*Relatedly… On the heels of the above, Investigative Redditor* u/stetoe [*put together this brilliant post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g9dt5h/with_calls_for_new_rule_changes_after_verstappens/) *compiling all of the F1 rule changes that have occurred since 2016 as a direct result of Max doing Max things.*

*(For those fascinated and eager for a follow up, by popular demand* u/stetoe *cobbled together similar posts as above,* [*but for rules changed due to Lewis Hamilton,*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga7lqk/by_request_i_also_compiled_all_the_f1_rules/) *as well as for* [*the changes triggered by Sebastian Vettel)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbsett/surprisingly_few_all_the_f1_rules_changed_or/)*.*

***Okay, let’s move on from the driving standards rabble-babble:***

Fernando Alonso started his 400th Grand Prix in Mexico (pretty impressive for a rookie, if I may say so), [celebrating the occasion with this lovely special lid.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8s0xp/fernando_alonso_will_start_his_400th_f1_gp_in/)

In celebration of his time-bending achievement, Young Fernando appeared on F1’s Beyond The Grid podcast to discuss [why—and how—he’s still fired up for racing in Formula 1 after 400 races](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga67mt/fernando_at_400_why_alonsos_still_fired_up/) (hint: he might be a vampire).

Thanks to his dynamite opening performances, there’s a [“carambola (which means *lucky chance* in Argentine Spanish) for Franco Colapinto to be on the grid next year.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8w9ma/virutasf1_there_is_a_carambola_for_franco/) In order for that to happen though, there’ll have to be driver movement elsewhere on the grid—as well as sponsors who will have a say.

*Aaaaand apparently* [*Franco has an offer on the table from Red Bull:*](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gckaxb/sky_italia_f1_drivers_market_future_of_colapinto/) For which team and seat we know not. The hang-up, of course, is that Williams would have to release or loan Franco to a team they’ve got eyes on competing with soon… But JV did say the other week that he wants Franco on the grid, regardless if that means Williams loses points as a result. So who knows!

Pundit Lawrence Barretto claims that [“Valtteri Bottas is in good shape to retain his Sauberaudi seat, but F2 championship leader Gabriel Bortoleto is still under consideration”.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gahgbl/lawrence_barretto_i_understand_valtteri_bottas_is/) I say give me another rookie or give me death!

However, returning for another with Sauberaudi isn’t Valtteri’s only option, apparently. [Lawrence also reports that Bottas is in talks with Mercedes to return in a non-racing role as a back up](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbamaw/lawrence_barretto_valtteri_bottas_says_his/) (meaning reserve, I presume). 

And given we’re on the Americas leg of the season, the annual [“Sergio Perez is in trouble and perhaps on his last legs”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gauy46/contract_warning_for_sergio_perez_after_lawson/) rumours are bubbling up from the underworld. I’ll report on them due to his woeful trend of underperformance, but definitely, absolutely, certainly take them a spoonful of salt or two.

*However, his dearth of performance in Mexico won’t help matters.*

For another rumbling to take with a spoonful of salt (sadly), at Honda’s ~~incessant pressuring~~ behest, [Yuki Tsunoda seems to be *finally* getting a Red Bull test in Abu Dhabi this year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb956m/lawrence_barretto_yuki_tsunoda_says_theres_a_good/) Much as I’d love to see him have a season in the car, I think we all know this won’t go anywhere though :(

\~\~\~

# The Teams’ Twistings & Turnings

The War of Words between McLaren and Red Bull has been quick to return to boil, with [Lando throwing some shade at Max](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8rtba/but_the_rules_are_the_rules/) (and the FIA). In blithe response, [Max noted that McLaren have been “complaining a lot lately.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8l92a/mclaren_complain_a_lot_lately_says_verstappen_as/)

Meanwhile, Master Shit-Stirrer [Toto Wolff called Red Bull’s contentious ride height adjustment device “outrageous” and laughed at their “Bugs Bunny” tool.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8mzbk/wolff_labels_red_bull_bib_device_outrageous/) In a cantina somewhere in Mexico City, Zak Brown was seen furiously scribbling notes on “how to stir the pot without being labeled a Karen…”

\~\~\~

# Technical Tidbits

In a move that all fans are sure to hate if this results in what I expect it will, [Duracell has become F1’s first DRS Zone sponsor in Las Vegas.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g8sz6d/duracell_becomes_f1s_first_drs_zone_sponsor_in/) I can hear the calls now… *“Max Verstappen enters the Duracell DRS Zone, which will surely help him stay ahead of Lando Norris for at least one more lap.”* If this pans out like Tissot’s sprint race sponsorship in MotoGP, you *will* hear “Duracell” every time the camera feed moves through this section of track.

If you, like everyone at Mercedes I presume, are tired of the ride height shenanigans of this current generation of cars, [you’ll be thrilled to know that F1’s 2026 regulations will leave behind the current ride height nightmares.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1ga76b3/why_f1s_2026_rules_will_shake_off_rideheight/)

\~\~\~

# Paddock Playtime

I’m not sure how this video was allowed to escape the Red Bull garage, [so get a load of what a current F1 car looks like under the skin while you still can.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb68a0/formula_aerodynamics_so_much_technology_fudo2/)

Williams and their new partner Mercado Libre (courtesy of Young Gun Franco Colapito) put together [this fun little commercial](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb2gp5/mercado_libre_commercial_revealing_the_new/) revealing their special livery for Mexico and Brazil. [Gallery pics of the car can be found here if you wish.](https://www.williamsf1.com/posts/1b734b55-9192-45df-9211-a3dc22479449/williams-racing-mercado-libre-heritage-inspired-yellow-engine-cover)

If you happen to have a cool few million to burn on non-essentials, [you can get your paws on Michael Schumacher’s 2006 Ferrarimobile.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1galaue/michael_schumachers_2006_ferrari_formula_1_car_is/)

Perhaps the world’s most famous bulldog, [Roscoe, son of Lewis, turns 12!](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gbcj2s/lewishamilton_everyone_wish_my_son/)

Who knew [Charles Leclerc would look so natural and at home in a mariachi outfit?!](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gb71zy/charles_leclerc_arriving_at_the_paddock_dressed/) I suppose that’s that pretty privilege coming to the fore…

Should you have the niche curiosity of wondering what driving the F1 Safety Car is like, long-time [SC Pilot Bernd Maylander spilled the beans on his (pretty neat) job in this interview with Formula 1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gclkgk/maylander_on_what_its_like_to_drive_the_aston/)

1gextdp,Ferrari is the anti-McLaren: here is the Prancing Horse's extra weapon,https://formu1a.uno/it/ferrari-e-lanti-mclaren-ecco-larma-in-piu-del-cavallino/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1gextdp/ferrari_is_the_antimclaren_here_is_the_prancing/,2024-10-29,0 days,,"[""> here is the Prancing Horse's extra weapon\n\nIt's called Max Verstappen, since he'll go to any lengths including compromising his own race in order to make sure Norris doesn't win."", ""Translation \n\n\nIt hasn't happened since 2022 with the F1-75 that Ferrari won two races in a row. In Mexico Carlos Sainz did what his teammate had managed a week earlier in Austin. A decisive and deserved victory for the driver from Madrid, who had also taken an always complicated pole position for Ferrari, in a weekend certainly with fewer hitches than Leclerc. Lando Norris got between the two reds, taking away the chance for the Prancing Horse to repeat the one-two. However, a first and a third position remain that have an important weight in the Constructors' Championship.\n\n\nFerrari is now second in the Constructors and is the real anti-McLaren. The consistency of Leclerc and Sainz could be the extra weapon.\n\nThe SF-24 is now the real rival of the English team leading the constructors' championship, with Red Bull completely disappeared and, by Max Verstappen's own admission, never really fighting in recent weeks for the most coveted championship for most of the team owners. Ferrari's recovery could be considered sensational given that in two weekends, the Leclerc-Sainz duo has recovered 46 points on McLaren, now moving into second place at -29 points with four GPs to go. Enrico Cardile's former car has been put back on the right track with the update packages introduced in Monza and Singapore, confirming overseas that the steps forward made are to be considered more than important .\n\n\nIs Ferrari now the best car overall? In Maranello they don't want to hear about it, also because there is the certainty that the Mexican GP would have been much more complicated to win without the important skirmishes between Verstappen and Norris. The latter in fact showed the best race pace after the switch to hard tyres and a certain drop in asphalt temperature while he was certainly slowed down by Max Verstappen in the first part of the race, where Ferrari managed to open up the gap that guaranteed him the victory with Sainz.\n\n\nThe English McLaren driver used the new bottom all weekend, which was not a given at least at the start of the weekend, a sign that the important improvements expected by the Woking team were seen on track in FP2. For his part, Leclerc had to manage a lot, with a continuous lift-and-coast that prevented him from keeping the pace of the Madrid driver also due to the difficulty of keeping the tyres in the optimal window. It should also be underlined that having skipped FP1 and not having been able to work significantly on the set-ups in FP2 , due to the hour and a half dedicated mainly to testing the Pirelli tyres, did not help the Monegasque driver . A Leclerc who already in Austin had adapted more slowly to the new balance generated by a much more flexible front wing than the specification that had debuted in Singapore , and only with the setup changes between the Sprint and Main Race had he found that little something extra that had allowed him to dominate on the American Sunday. In Mexico, the time available was very short for the Monegasque, who entered qualifying almost in the dark regarding the set-up, so much so that he did not perform as well as his teammate.\n\n\nMexico has put to rest any doubts about the progress of SF-24, but will Interlagos close the circle?\n\nNow Ferrari is clearly the anti-McLaren and the gap from the top, after the latest evolutions brought to the SF-24, in certain phases and technical areas seems to have almost disappeared. And so the consistency of the Leclerc-Sainz duo could be the extra weapon in an unexpected, at least until a few weeks ago, chase for the constructors, which has been missing from Maranello since the distant 2008. If the car is able to compete for the victory, it seems more likely that there will be at least two drivers dressed in red on the podium than dressed in orange and this could be a significant advantage. An aspect in which McLaren – with the little experience of Piastri and an alternating current Lando Norris – and Red Bull – with a Perez in free fall – are lacking compared to the red driver lineup.\n\n\nAt Interlagos it is very likely that we will see both McLarens equipped with the latest updates, and not just Lando Norris' MCL38, also to try to respond to the hard attack by Ferrari in the last two events. The Brazilian track will close the triptych of consecutive races that began in Austin, and is quite complete given that there are slow sections and also long and medium and high speed support corners, as well as weather that is still to be evaluated, especially for the Sunday race. Red Bull and Max Verstappen left Mexico with very few positives, except for the few points lost by the Dutchman against Norris. However, the RB20 still lacks a lot technically compared to Ferrari and McLaren even after the developments brought to Texas, which have improved the English car in terms of connection between the front and rear axle but have not significantly widened the operating window. This is why we see Max Verstappen constantly racing in defense, clinging to even incorrect maneuvers to ruin his rival's race, favoring in a certain way Ferrari, a clear ally of the three-time world champion. For their part, in Maranello they know they still have a chance in Brazil to give continuity to the best technical moment of the season for the SF-24, with only the Qatar layout that 'scaries'. No updates are planned for Ferrari , with the men from Maranello who will continue to work to extract the maximum from the SF-24, in what will once again be a weekend with the Sprint Race."", "">here is the Prancing Horse's extra weapon\n\nDU DU DU DU"", 'The answer is Max Verstappen', 'McLaren just needs to make the DELL logo a bit bigger and the championship is secured.', ""They've been so impressive the last couple races, just got on with it, no weird strategies or anything"", ""The Prancing Horse's secret weapon is Max's donkey legs."", '“New bottom”\n\nSnigger', 'Why did you have to jinx it?']",18,13,2024-10-29 17:21:59, News,7,1

I'd love to hear some people's suggestions on how a better rule could be written. It might also be useful to the discussion for others to poke holes in suggested rules, to see how they could be gamed. Maybe ultimately we can come up with something better...

IMO rules should be very simple to understand in the heat of battle, but also very clear cut to enable easy decision making by the stewards.","['Send it. Let the gods decide.', '""Just do it""', 'Maybe stay on the track.\nLegal defending must remain within track limits or lose position', "">How would you write a better overtaking rule?\n\nI wouldn't.\n\nThe problem is that as soon as you codify what overtaking is in the rules, you'll get teams challenging everything that falls outside that definition. And there's often going to be scenarios that arise where you cannot address them.\n\nTake, for instance, the incident between Verstappen and Norris at Turn 4 in Mexico. Norris was slightly ahead of Verstappen going into the corner. Does that mean that he had completed an overtake? No -- as we have seen on countless occasions, you need to be a good way ahead of another driver to overtake around the outside there. But if Norris had been on the inside of the corner, he would need to be much less further ahead of Verstappen to make that pass work. So straight away we have a corner where the criteria for judging the success of an overtake is different depending on the position of the cars on the track. You can't write a rule to address that, because then you'd have to write a rule to address every position going into every corner on every circuit. And that's before we even consider the presence of Sainz in the Turn 4 incident -- he was going through a slow apex when Verstappen and Norris arrived. Verstappen's choices were a) brake hard, b) hit Sainz, or c) take a more shallow line to avoid contact. He chose the third option, which on balance was probably the best option since braking hard risked a lock-up and hitting Sainz was never an option.\n\nThe vast majority of responses to the proposal of writing rules around overtaking seem to have one thing in mind: creating a scenario were Norris can get ever-so-slightly ahead of Verstappen, and thus requiring Verstappen to immediately concede the position."", 'Really simple.\n\nIf aproaching the corner there is overlap of at least front wheel to rear wheel then both cars must be left at least a cars width to the edge of the track on both inside and outside.\n\nSimples', 'Just leave it the way it is with one amendment.  Any car that has established their position with their front tires at minimum in front of the rear tires of the opposing car, either on the inside or the outside of another car, prior to the breaking zone, is entitled to enough space to remain on the racetrack alongside the opposing car throughout the corner or until the leading cars rearmost point is in front of the trailing cars forward most point.', 'Both cars stay within track limits. \n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.', 'This post and the comments really show why redditors should never be allowed to influence the rules, holy batman', 'I’d scrap the rules except some basic guidelines (not shoving other drivers off track and idk what else) and deal with the real issue which is inconsistent stewarding']",0,90,2024-10-29 17:22:00, Discussion,0,0
1geekse,What was happening with Charles on Sunday? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1geekse/what_was_happening_with_charles_on_sunday/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1geekse/what_was_happening_with_charles_on_sunday/,2024-10-28,0 days,"This is a genuine question because I wasn’t able to watch the race and instead caught glimpses in live timings

The main thing i seen about the race was discourse over regulations and then flashes of discourse from the Ferrari  side.

I kind of assumed it was a bit of dramatics from Charles fans (I am also a Charles fan but sometimes things are blown out of proportion), like claiming Ferrari used team orders to stop Charles overtaking in Australia when Charles was never in the position to.

But I finally decided to go back and see what happened and I am so confused about what happened in the first stint.

I don’t think I have enough technical f1 knowledge to know what Ferrari were trying to do. I seen a comment from Fred after seeming to talk about future engine saving?

How urgent was this because continuing to tell Charles to slow his pace and letting him build such a gap is so risky, unless it was needed to finish the race strong.

Especially when they know Lando’s behind and something that’s been true all season but was especially evident with Mclarens updates the previous race, is Mclaren is a different beast on hards.

In COTA, Mclaren went from not even being close to a threat to having more pace than Ferrari on the hards. Ferrari never had to worry about it cause he was stuck behind Max but if he wasn’t then he would’ve been a threat to at least Carlos.

I think COTA made people almost underestimate the pace of the Mclaren because of the dirty air medium stint, but go back and look at Lando on hards, in dirty air. He had very minimal tire age advantage as well.

So going into the second stint, with no Max in between, that is a very dangerous position to be in.

The second stint seems pretty simple. Good pace, get stuck in dirty air behind cars, have Lando catch up and the push very, very hard to try and stay ahead which hurt his tires, especially cause the majority of his pushing was when overtaking lapped cars.

That was the right plan of action for that stint because Mercedes were too far back to be a threat, and so it’s let Lando past and nurse tires or push hard and burn tires but maybe be able to hold Lando back.

But Charles should’ve been able to have a big enough gap from the medium stint to be able to have a solid pace and manage his tires without having to base it on Lando.

You can never bet against Mclaren (specifically Lando) not having the pace advantage on hards on low fuel. Lando has never not been the fastest in those conditions since Imola, unless something he’s stuck behind someone or other extenuating circumstances.

So what i’m wondering is what was the issue? Was it a we need to do this for the sake of the race and the car or we should do this because it’ll help us later and Charles is in a pretty safe position.

Having two drivers running p1 and p2 when they have similar pace and are close together, especially if the one behind has slightly better pace but nothing to switch positions over is a very difficult situation to handle, so was it Ferrari choosing an advantageous time so the drivers wouldn’t fight each other? 

I’m genuinely asking out of confusion because i feel like i’ve missed so many details and i don’t understand what the radio messages were really meaning.","[""It's likely that the brakes were actually heating up too much, given the thin air in Mexico - this was massively exacerbated by running behind Sainz for a short while, especially the 3 or 4 laps where he was within 1.5 seconds.\n\nI will put a little tweak to your points though. Sainz was faster in Mexico, but in Australia the team did radio to Charles to stop him from fighting Sainz. This was because they didn't think they'd be able to challenge for the win again this season - how wrong they were!"", '>You can never bet against Mclaren (specifically Lando) not having the pace advantage on hards on low fuel. Lando has never not been the fastest in those conditions since Imola, unless something he’s stuck behind someone or other extenuating circumstances.\n\nAt the end, it was pretty much this. And then he had the incredible save onto the frontstretch, and that sealed it.', 'There was no issue per se. He had to use LiCo to cool the car and had some holdup from a few backmarkers which closed the gap to Lando.\n\nI’ve seen more than a few fans of a certain fanbase suggest nefarious conspiracies and it really shows how unhinged fans can be.', 'I did not compare his onboard with Carlos. But his brake was nearly overheated all the time, which was caused by dirty air probably. And he was seldom great in Mexico, which may also relate to the LiCo issue.', 'Leclerc was asked to do lico and so was Sainz. However when Leclerc hit the back marker traffic he was told ‘no more lico’ so I assume he was saving his engine for needing to overtake backmarkers. The backmarkers not letting him through quickly enough didn’t help. The McLaren comes alive in the second stint and Norris (who has been saving his tyres for this part of his race) starts eating up the advantage Leclerc built over him throughout the race. Leclerc couldn’t do anything about that as his tyres had gone. Norris was already faster and getting quicker. It was a case of when Norris would pass him not if. He just made it easier by going off the track. \n\nI know that Ferrari radioed Charles to tell him not to fight Sainz, but in their defence it was the right decision. Sainz was faster and they would have lost time fighting knowing that Norris would be coming back at them in the second stint. It worked for Ferrari. I wouldn’t have minded them fighting, it would have been Norris’ win if that happened.', ""I mean even if there was a serious issue with the PU or overheating with the breaks, i doubt they would say it on the radio outright. plus if these were indirect team orders charles' expression after the race would let you know. he is not good at hiding his displeasure lol.\n\nmy conspiracy theory is ollie's crash in fp1 and the rebuild after that did more damage than expected."", 'Backmarkers fucked him.

If a driver accumulates 20 seconds or more without having served any of them up until then, automatically convert all those penalties into a DT or S&G.","['Can’t remember the last drive through or stop and go penalty, we only see 5/10 seconds now.', ""I'd rather have an escalation on penalties to stop just consistent reckless driving, like we had with KMag earlier this year.\n\nFirst instance 10 seconds, 2nd drive through, third stop go, 4th black flag and a race ban."", ""No. The penalties currently in place work fine, it's the consistency of their application on everyone that's the problem."", 'That’s the whole point of the penalty points system. \n\nIn the words of Sainz, “Stop Inventing”', 'No, the time penalties work as intended.', ""We should just stop having them serve penalties in the pits and instead have them take a 'penalty-route' that is 5/10 seconds longer sort of like a return route as there are on certain corners if you go off. That way smaller penalties can be served immediately. Then we don't get someone like Verstappen or Magnussen using their pre-penalty track position to game the system."", ""How do you punish something differently for the same infraction when the person in the instance you're using as an example didn't know they had a penalty.

Here is how I see it, I'm open to have my views refuted on this.

  
1. They are arriving in the corner pretty much side-by-side, Lando being slightly ahead, he squeezes Max to the apex.

2. They are still side-by-side, Verstappen is almost in the back of the Ferrari, gets squeezed even tighter to the apex, Max starts slightly going wider to avoid driving to the back of the Ferrari.

3. You see Max going wider, otherwise he would've crashed into the back of the Ferrari, you could argue that he went wider to take evasive action into crashing into the Ferrari.

4. Max stays in the white lines, Lando goes slightly off, is barely outside of the white lines.

5. Lando just ignores the track lines completely and takes a sharp right turn.

6. You can see Lando take even sharper turn to the right to completely cut off the corner to end up ahead of Sainz and Verstappen, but Sainz has the speed advantage and overtakes Norris once again.

I'm not trying to defend anyone here, I just want to understand the penalty better.","[""It's simple. Lando was alongside Max at the apex (less than half a car length alongside). Therefore, according to rules, he's entitled space. Max didn't give it to him and pushed him off. So, by the letter of the rule, Max had to be penalized.\n\nThe Ferrari being there didn't allow Max to divebomb the apex just to be ahead by half a car length at the apex like he did at COTA. After that, if the Ferrari doesn't allow Max to go as fast as he wants, tough luck. It's racing.\n\nThis being said, the being half a car length ahead at the apex rule is total BS. If a car is alongside, that driver deserves space"", ""The key is that, with the way the guidelines are currently, as long as Lando is level with or ahead of Max on the outside, it's Max's responsibility to give him enough room to be able to complete the corner on track.\n\nIn that position, regardless of the Ferrari, Max can't force Lando off the track without getting a penalty.\n\nYou also missed the final step, when Lando gave the position straight back to Sainz ~~and Verstappen~~ because he cut the corner."", 'Very biased interpretion of events for someone ""impartial""\n\n""Max stays in the white lines, Lando goes slightly off, is barely outside of the white lines"" \n\nHe didn\'t just ""go slightly off"" himself, he stayed on track the entire time until Max literally hit him with his car (yes, their front tires touched). Pretty hard to stay on track when someone really doesn\'t want you there.', '""I\'m impartial""    \nProceeds to only phrase things in the most positive way possible to favor Max. ;)  \n\nYou have to keep one thing in mind - Max could have gone at a normal speed into the turn and braked earlier/harder at any point, but he didn\'t - he kept more speed into the turn, that\'s why he was so close to the Ferrari. He\'s not taking evasive actions, he\'s running wide on purpose. Why ? Because he knows Lando is on his outside, and he wants to run him out of road just like he did last week. Except this time, Lando was ahead at the apex, so while he didn\'t get penalised for it last week, this time around he\'s supposed to give him the space, and he didn\'t - on purpose, again, it\'s not like he doesn\'t know how much speed he can carry, or how much angle he can or can\'t give his steering wheel.', '“Max goes wide not to crash into the Ferrari” Really? It’s called a brake pedal.\n\n“Lando goes slightly off”. There is no such thing ad slightly off. Either off or on.\n\n“Lando ignores track lines completely”. If Lando had tried to follow the track he would have had to make an even sharper right, which means slowing down more. Pressing the brake on the grass is a major no-no. Could have crashes in either car in front or both. He gave the place back in the end.', '>They are arriving in the corner pretty much side-by-side, **Lando being slightly ahead**\n\nYou answered your own question.\n\nRead the official decision here: [https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Mexico%20City%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Infringement%20-%20Car%201%20-%20Turn%204%20Forcing%20another%20driver%20of%20the%20track%20(corrected).pdf](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Mexico%20City%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Infringement%20-%20Car%201%20-%20Turn%204%20Forcing%20another%20driver%20of%20the%20track%20(corrected).pdf)', 'Kind of interesting, if you\'re really unbiased you see this incident in a very different way to myself.\n\nI went back and watched the helicopter cam multiple times and watched the Onboards from Norris and Verstappen because I didn\'t get where you are coming from. And I still don\'t get it.\n\nThere is no ""sqeezing to the apex"". There is always a car\'s width of space on the inside of Norris. If you watch them on the straight before turn 4, it\'s just normal racing. Verstappen stays on the inside to defend. As soon as Norris commits to the outside, Verstappen drifts wide to the middle of the track to get a good entry into turn 4.\n\nMax doesn\'t take any evasive action to avoid the Ferrari. It\'s true to say he has to take the corner normal and can\'t overshoot the apex because Sainz is there. \n\nIn Verstappens Onboard you can see that he judged his approach to the corner perfectly, he doesn\'t even need to wait before getting on the throttle again.\n\nHe simply doesn\'t leave any space on the outside, which he has to do as Norris was in front at the apex. He has to step on the brakes hard for turn 5 to avoid crashing into Sainz, because of his exit out of turn 4.\n\nNorris then just cuts the corner completely because everything else would cost him more than 5 seconds.\n\nYou asked in a comment what Verstappen could have done differenty. He could have left a car\'s width space on the outside. But then he would have lost the position of course because the next turn is a sharp right.\n\nI also tried to judge if Norris would even have made the corner if he would have been given space. But I\'m not sure about that. Maybe, maybe not. We\'ll never know. And from what we learned last week in COTA it doesn\'t even matter because it\'s only important that you\'re ahead at the apex. That\'s the real BS in all of this.', ""I'm no expert in the rules and I don't even have a strong opinion either way, but I'll try to make the case for the penalty:\n\n1. Lando is slightly ahead going into the corner, which (as per the current rules) entitles him to space through the corner\n2. Lando is leaving enough space for Max on the inside (pretty much the normal reacing line, as can be seen by Max basically following Carlos' line into the corner exactly)\n3. Max is boxed in between Carlos in front and Lando on his right. This is a shitty situation for Max but not really uncommon, especially at the start of races. In this case you sometimes just have to brake harder and concede if you don't want to crash into the car in front. Max could have covered the outside on the straight before and Lando would probably go to the inside and be in the same position that Max found himself in.\n4. Max tries to avoid braking by opening the steering and taking a wider line through the corner. If he wants to do that, he still has to make sure Lando has space through the corner. \n5. Obviously I don't know but the track is quite wide and I find it hard to believe that Max wasn't able to take a tighter line, even after opening the steering, that leaves Lando enough space to stay on track. He doesn't do that.\n6. To me, it looks like he doesn't try very hard to tighten his line but is happy with drifting wide because he knows that will make Lando either crash into him or go off track. \n7. Therefore you could argue he pushed Lando off the track even though Lando was (as per the current rules) entitled to space. Thats why the penalty is deserved."", 'Pretty simple. Drivers are side by side so both drivers need to leave space. Lando left space for max on the inside, max did not leave space for Lando on the outside.']",0,59,2024-10-29 17:22:03, Discussion,0,0
