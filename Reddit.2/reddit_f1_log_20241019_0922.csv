In terms of regulations updated and posted we have: 

* [2024 Technical Regulations](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_technical_regulations_-_issue_8_-_2024-10-17.pdf)

* [2025 Sporting Regulations](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2025_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_2_-_2024-10-17.pdf)

These changes will possibly not be an exhaustive list. 

***

# [2024 Technical Regulations](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_technical_regulations_-_issue_8_-_2024-10-17.pdf)

- The only change is Mule Car Rims being added to the table in Appendix 5 which defines the classification of components for Formula One cars and support equipment. 

***

# [2025 Sporting Regulations](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2025_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_2_-_2024-10-17.pdf)

- As stated by the FIA the entire section in regards to the fastest lap point has been removed.

- A change stating that Competitors may not have or use more than 1 car for the purpose of Testing Previous Cars (TPC). It also defines what a day is when Testing Previous Cars (a single 9 hour period between 09:00 & 19:00). This testing is limited to Grade 1/1T circuits and may not take place on a circuit hosting a championship round:
  1. 60 days prior to it hosting that race        
  2. If the Circuit did not host a race in the year falling immediately prior to the year of the championship      
  3. If the circuit is deemed to have undergone significant modification following the relevant race in the year falling immediately prior to the year of the championship     

- They can only complete a maximum of 20 days of TPC in each calendar year. And may only complete a maximum of 1000 km of TPC in each calendar year with drivers entered into the championship. And that can only be accumulated over a maximum of 4 days of that allowed 20 days of TPC.

- The requirements for *conditions of poor visibility* have been removed from the section in regards to disabling the DRS. It is now entirely up to the race director's discretion as to turning it off or on.

- As stated it is now required on 2 occasions during the championship for each car entered into the championship to use a rookie driver

- It is now formally written that should either qualifying session not happen then the grid for the sprint race or the main race will be based upon the Driver's Championship classification. The standard procedure for forming the grid in regards to penalties etc will be applied to that classification. If for whatever reason that method of forming the grid cannot be applied it shall be at the sole discretion of the stewards as to how the grid will be formed. 

- There is a clarification that if you wish to do multiple reconnaissance laps you must you use pit entry road when you wish to enter the pit lane to do so.

# 2026 [Sporting](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2026_f1_regulations_-_section_b_sporting_-_iss01_-_2024-10-17.pdf), [Technical](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2026_f1_regulations_-_section_c_technical_-_iss09_-_2024-10-17.pdf) & [Financial](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2026_f1_regulations_-_section_d_financial_-f1_teams_-_iss01_-_2024-10-17.pdf) Regulations

These are harder to write out the difference as it is quite a significant change to the regulations and more significantly they have also completely rewritten the regulations from the ground up and given them a brand new easy to read format.          
The Sporting, Technical & Financial Regulations are now split into Sections B, C & D respectively with article codes including those letters for easy cross referencing (Although they have forgotten to do this with the Financial Regulations....).

You will note there is no Section A. I believe this is because the Sporting Regulations no longer include any of the regulations in regards to the Governance of the sport, the General Undertaking of said regulations, certain bits on licences or indeed how points are awarded. I assume this section will come later.

Because of all of this it's hard to pinpoint changes, some things of note that immediately jumped out though:

- Qualifying or Practice sessions are now defined as LTCS or Lap Time Classified Sessions. Race sessions are defined as TTCS or Total Time Classified Sessions

- A whole bunch of factors in regards to the energy deployment for the Override Mode will be defined by the FIA on a race by race basis and announced 4 weeks prior to each competition. These factors include:        
  1. The maximum electrical power of the ERS-K, as a function of car speed, when the Override mode is **NOT** active        
  2. The maximum electrical power of the ERS-K, as a function of car speed, when the Override mode is active        
  3. The maximum energy that can be harvested on a single lap, when the Override mode is **NOT** active        
  4. The maximum energy that can be harvested on a single lap, when the Override mode is active when the driver crosses the line at the start of the lap       
  5. The time gap between the car in front in the detection zone so as to active the Override Mode      
  6. The position of the Detection Line       
  7. The position of the Activation Line       

I'm very sure there is significantly more that can be found and looked over.
