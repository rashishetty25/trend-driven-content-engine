The Key Points was the new Rules are too complex, Engine too reliant on Chassis design and reloading the Battery. Customers Team will get the Engines Layout way too late and will be compromised alot. 

They also talked this with Fred Vasseur about this and he confirmed that customers Team won't have a Chance in the new Rules. Renault Vyril PU Engineers also this to Renault CEO.

Aston Martin knew this from the beginning and signed with Honda.

So what option does McLaren have now? 



","['I‚Äôm pretty sure that part of the deal to keep McLaren at Mercedes was that they get to be in the room when the engine is being developed. The threat from RBPT was that big at the time that Mercedes gave away the advantage they would have had over McLaren.\n\nEDIT: [here‚Äôs an article about it.](https://speedcafe.com/mclaren-influence-mercedes-engine-development-2026/)', ""So generally this has been common wisdom in F1 and why generally the top 3-4 teams will always be a works team and why that is a very coveted seat to fill.\n\nIt's why the McHonda disaster happened in the first place and why RB-Renault relations have always been strained especially since Renault re-entered the sport (and subsequently flopped hard in the hybrid era).\n\nHOWEVER, teams are not nearly secretive as before and particularly Mercedes have had better collaboration with customers than you would see historically from engine manufacturers. secondly, the FIA during the early days of the hybrid era has slammed down on special engine maps only available to works teams i.e 'Party Mode' and we will expect to see parity from the software side now too.\n\nIt does however limit designers especially people like Newey who design the car wholistically and would like to have a say on engine dimensions/packaging to suit his Aero needs. On this part customer teams have their hands tied a bit.\n\nIt's not a silver bullet tho and imo short term customer teams with good engines will have better luck than works teams with bad engines."", 'No\n\nMcLaren will be a VIP customer (or customer with some advantages in the engine development process) so they could be like Force India or Williams in 2014-16 (with better economics).', ""Absolutely! Things are always up in the air when it comes to new regulations, but this should be the most level playing field during a regulations change in F1 history.\n\n7 teams will have similar facilities, workforces and be running at the cost cap. The manufactrers PU development is being done under a cost cap and there are strict regulations regarding supply parity, engine modes, mounting points and dissemination of information through the homologation dossier. None of those things were true at any point in the past, especially in 2014. This is by design, the regulations have been crafted to ensure that you can compete as a customer on a level playing field.\n\nAdd to that, Williams and Mclaren made sure that they had access and input to Mercedes PU design in their PU deals, which means that they likely won't have much, if any penalty from being a customer.\n\nIn fact, that could be our best shot at a super close championship in '26. If the Merc is (as expected) the best PU, having 4 teams that could compete at the front is pretty exciting."", ""Mercedes and McLaren negotiated a deal for 2026-onward which gives McLaren a seat at the table in PU design so they have input and always know exactly what's going on with the engine, allowing them to effectively design their car around the PU instead of designing their car then buying the PU afterwards.\n\nThat makes them a pseudo-works team, and yeah, means their status as a customer team shouldn't matter nor hold them back in 2026. TBH this is what the rules should force engine suppliers to do for customer teams they provide their engines to, for the good of the sport.\n\nThe other customer teams as far as I know don't have this benefit and are mostly blind to how their engines will perform relative to the chassis, so they'll probably struggle a bit at the beginning of the regulations."", ""It will be much harder for them than compared to today, where the engine freeze and rules around ICE mode parity make it fairer.\n\nFor the 2026 rules, I believe they've put in some rules to ensure that customer teams get the same engine modes and things like that. The challenge, as you've alluded to, is around cooling and packing. The cooling requirement for the next gen battery is going to be significant. I suspect the manufacturers will have some kind of immediate advantage, albeit smaller than what we saw with the current ones."", 'I think McLaren, a customer team, is a contender until proven otherwise.', 'Red Bull and Mclaren have both won titles as customer cars.', 'The cost cap still exists.']",512,88,2024-10-14 06:33:07, Discussion,16,2

The hunt for the French engineers has already begun. Ferrari, Audi and Red Bull are seizing their chance.\n\nThe unions' fight was ultimately in vain. On September 30, Alpine's parent company Renault confirmed the end of its own engine production in Viry-Ch√¢tillon. In the middle of the year, Alpine had already announced that it wanted to use a customer engine from 2026 and convert the factory in Viry-Ch√¢tillon into a technology center. Talks with Mercedes about a new partnership are already well advanced behind the scenes.\n\nAfter it finally became clear at the end of September that there would be no more power units from Renault from 2026, the competition is now rubbing its hands together. Ferrari in particular did not hesitate for long. According to information from auto motor und sport, a few dozen engine engineers from Viry-Ch√¢tillon have already held job interviews with Ferrari. By hiring high-ranking Renault technicians, Ferrari could buy itself a decisive advantage.\n\nOn the one hand, the Scuderia would gain valuable knowledge, as a prototype for the new engine regulations from 2026 has already been running on the test bench at Renault since June of this year. And on the other hand, Ferrari would weaken its direct competition because the know-how of Renault engineers would not be passed on to its direct competitors."", 'Things about to get Viry spicy.', ""A lot of people are questioning why other teams want Renault's engineers just bc they have the weakest PU on the grid rn. While that might be true now, it might not be the case for 2026.\n\nIt's still valuable to have your competitor's engineers on your staff. They can tell you about the direction and ideas that your competitors went down and what was promising or wasn't. There might be some diamonds in the rough. Let's not forget that Brawn's double diffuser idea came in part from Super Aguri which was dogwater.\n\nAlso, just because the end result isn't good, doesn't mean that the staff aren't good themselves. Success in F1 doesn't just come down to the people you have.

Of course I am just manually looking, so there‚Äôs no adjustment for track length or anything.

But i was writing out what they usually are and i noticed something sort of interesting (doesn‚Äôt hold any actual importance though)

Charles has out-qualified Carlos by a  margin of 1-0.05 (in terms of a tenth) 6 times with 3 being under .10

And he‚Äôs out-qualified him by a margin of over 2 and a quarter tenths 7 times, 4 being over 3 and a half tenths

But he‚Äôs never out qualified Carlos within the range of 1 tenth to 2.25.
If you found the average of the usual gap Charles out-qualifies Carlos by it‚Äôs probably somewhere between this 2 numbers, but yet he‚Äôs never actually been in those numbers.

 You‚Äôd think that would be the most common gap, but instead either Charles is dominating or it‚Äôs insanely close.

Carlos‚Äôs gaps to Charles when he‚Äôs out qualified are more normal even with only 6 values.

It does probably hurt Charles if people find their average gap using the median, because their (unadjusted inaccurate just the physical numbers of the gaps) median difference

is +0.37 to Charles
but to the Charles side of that the numbers are 
+.73, +1, +2.25, +2.48, +2.63, + 3.54

and to Carlos side 
+0.08, +0.06, +0.05, -0.06, -1.04, -1.93

I just thought it was interesting how many times Charles and Carlos were neck and neck in qualifying and also how many times Carlos wasn‚Äôt really close at all and yet there was somehow never a middle ground between that ","[""If Sainz is on his best and Leclerc is not, they're very close, and Carlos can eek out a win. But if it's the opposite, Leclerc will most likely leave Sainz behind with a good margin.\n\nThis is probably the best year of Sainz as a F1 driver. The problem lies with the fact that Leclerc is also having one of the best seasons of his career."", 'For me, quali of SF-24 is hard to judge. Because it is a mediocre one in quali with significant tires warm-up issues. Btw, IMO Carlos may occasionally choose quali-preferred set-up a little bit or Charles may sometimes choose race-preferred set-up slightly. Because their race pace differences are bigger than the quali.(And IMO Carlos was not that type of guy who was significant faster on Saturday than Sunday before he joined Ferrari.) But it is just my guessing, no evidence to prove and I can be completely wrong lol.', 'Someone did a calculation of their average gap across their time as teammates and and it‚Äôs stayed [pretty consistent](https://x.com/formulaur_/status/1840076080926929202?s=46) across the years, near 0.130-0.150% favoring Leclerc.', 'In‚Ä¶.checks notes‚Ä¶. six races, we aren‚Äôt going to have to discuss this any more, are we?  /s \n\nüòÄ', 'Be interesting to see the Lewis Charles gap once Lewis has settled in of course. Actually, considering Leclerc is acknowledged to be one of the very best qualifiers the  gap with Carlos is closer than I thought it would be.', ""In a very general sense, when the car is suited to Charles, he's significantly quicker than Carlos.\n\nWhen the car isn't suited to Charles, it's extremely close."", 'I think it\'s because these cars are so temperamental, and Leclerc is more than likely going to be quicker in quali.\n\nGeorge and Lewis are seeing similar results. Everyone is like ""Lewis is getting obliterated in quali"" and he is, but it\'s by literal hundredths of a second on average.\n\nSometimes it\'ll jump to 1-2 tenths when he struggles with the tyres, but normally they\'re incredibly close, George is just getting that last few hundredths which keeps making it look like he\'s just demolishing him. \n\nPlus the top 7 are normally so close, if you\'re 1 tenth off your teammate, you\'re dropping 5-6 positions from where he\'s starting, so it makes the difference in quali look even worse.', ""1. Track conditions and characteristics can play to drivers' strengths differently so in the end I really don't think saying x driver smokes y driver on a good day/is more talented etc. means anything\n2. Your gap of 1-2.5 tenths is quite arbitrary. Thinking this range of gaps is common is based on a surface level observation. Could be true, but the severity of the gaps are not consistent. 3 tenths in Monza is usually thought to be quite bad compared to on other tracks.\n\n>I just thought it was interesting how many times Charles and Carlos were neck and neck in qualifying and also how many times Carlos wasn‚Äôt really close at all\n\nThat said, this is what I feel happened in 2021, Sainz's first season and 2022, when Sainz struggled in the first part of the season."", ""> Of course I am just manually looking, so there‚Äôs no adjustment for track length or anything.\n\n> But he‚Äôs never out qualified Carlos within the range of 1 tenth to 2.25. If you found the average of the usual gap Charles out-qualifies Carlos by it‚Äôs probably somewhere between this 2 numbers, but yet he‚Äôs never actually been in those numbers.\n\n\n\nIf you convert it to a % then you will adjust to track length.\n\nIt's possible that Carlos is within that gap, but track length just doesn't show it as a discrete number.""]",44,22,2024-10-14 06:33:09, Discussion,1,1
1g39coc,MONDAY TRASH TALK THREAD,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g39coc/monday_trash_talk_thread/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g39coc/monday_trash_talk_thread/,2024-10-14,0 days,"TRASH TALK 101 FOR ANYONE NEW HERE - BEACAUSE. TRASH. TALK. IS. A. GENERATIONAL. THREAD.

&#x200B;

STEP ONE: LURK ON THE SUB VERY REGULARLY, MAKING SURE TO SORT BY ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù.

&#x200B;

STEP TWO: GET INSPIRED BY WHATEVER MAD NARRATIVE OR TREND GRIPS THE SUB THAT PARTICULAR DAY / WEEK. OFF SEASON IS QUITE SLOW BUT RACE WEEKS / WEEKENDS SHOULD YIELD A LOT OF SUBJECT MATTER. THE MORE INSANE AND UNREALISTIC, THE BETTER QUALITY SUBJECT MATTER IT IS. WATCH PEOPLES' OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOUR VERY CLOSELY - IT WILL YIELD SOME FASCINATING INSIGHT.

&#x200B;

STEP THREE: AT THIS STAGE YOU MAY BE FEELING SICK WITH THE AMOUNT OF NONSENSE YOU HAVE FORCED YOURSELF TO VIEW. FEEL FREE TO STEP OVER INTO r/f1circlejerk AND MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER BY POSTING A MOCKING IMITATION OF THE NONSENSE.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER AS YOU BUILD YOUR TOLERANCE, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ABLE TO WAIT FOR MONDAY, THE HOLIEST OF DAYS. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU RACE DAY SUNDAY IS THE BEST DAY, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNENLIGHTENED SAVAGES.

&#x200B;

STEP FOUR:

&#x200B;

(A) AS SOON AS THE TRASH TALK THREAD IS POSTED, UPVOTE IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

&#x200B;

(B) \[REDACTED\]

&#x200B;

(C) THEN - UNLOAD YOUR MOCKERY AND SCORN OF ALL THE VILE RUBBISH YOU HAVE WITNESSED FROM SUB USERS AND ""RESPECTED"" ""JOURNALISTS"".

&#x200B;

(D) SIT BACK AND WATCH THE UPVOTES GATHER. CLEVER PHOTOSHOPS AND META REFERENCES WILL YIELD MORE UPVOTES.

&#x200B;

STEP FIVE: REALISE THAT TRUTH AND SENSE ONLY EXIST IN THIS THREAD AND MAKE IT YOUR WEEKLY MISSION TO POST HERE.

&#x200B;

AND REMEMBER: FLAIR UP AND SMASH THAT CAPS LOCK! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

&#x200B;

GOOD LUCK AND MAY THE TRASH TALK BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOUR.

1g2mrdr,"Clever people, can you help...If F1 introduced fan-assisted down force, would that help the cars to race closer by reducing dirty air coming from the cars?",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g2mrdr/clever_people_can_you_helpif_f1_introduced/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g2mrdr/clever_people_can_you_helpif_f1_introduced/,2024-10-13,0 days,"I've just been watching a review of the ""McMurtry Sp√©irling Pure"" on the Top Gear Magazine youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPZxcfglU2Q) and it got me wondering if using fans to suck the cars to the road would help deal with the aerodynamic wash coming off the cars. However my engineering ability/understanding is essentially zero, so I need people who know what they're talking about to explain why it is or isn't a good idea.

\*Edit I already know about the BT46B - I asked the question more from the respect of an FIA rule change, rather than a specific innovation from one team :)

\*Edit 2: Thank you. There are some really interesting answers here - I'm learning a lot","['Be careful: fia might just read fan and give us a fan boost', ""The best thing is to ask Gordon Murray. Because he built the F1 fan car (there were [others](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaparral_2J)) and now the [GMA T.50.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Murray_Automotive_T.50)\n\nThey know what you can do with them. Even today.\nAnd I think that with a fan as mean of getting more down force, we would see rear wings disappear on certain tracks like Monza. Because you don't really need them with a fan sucking you down.\nBut we would need way harder suspensions, die to the increase in down force.\n\nFurthermore, I think there are other limitations like debris and more power consumption. But it could work if done the right way."", 'They did have a fan car in F1 and part of the reason it was banned was that it sucked up debris from the track and was exhausting it behind the car making it dangerous to follow closely.', 'So literally this then?\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brabham_BT46', 'I think tough to say. Probably help with following but the extra downforce will make other things like braking zones and traction zones smaller, which would hurt racing as harder to setup overtaking manoeuvres.', 'Short answer it doesn\'t reduce dirty air, but it can make it less of a problem.\n\nLong answer is that should the FIA introduce fan-assisted downforce and figure out ways to deal with flying debris coming out of the fan, it is likely that they will also tone down the downforce generating capabilities of other stuff like wings, which generate complex flow structures that ""dirties"" the air, and is also the parts that are most easily affected by dirty air. If a car relies less on clean flow to generate downforce, it also becomes less affected by dirty air. \n\nSo while dirty air doesn\'t necessarily get reduced with the introduction of a fan, it makes dirty air less of an issue. But we are not taking into account the safety issues of a fan-based car that loses a lot of grip when it goes over a bump.', 'read this and thought ""fan? yes! finally we fans can become part of the team!"" then was like oh.. Vacuums? in a sort (ground effect) been tried, done and [Chaparral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaparral_Cars) in the 1970 [Can-Am](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can-Am).  and outlawed as ppl have limits and when it fails, mayhem can ensue.  but suppose could suck air off the top surface but flexing areo wings are sketchy so... doubtful.', 'Not really an answer to ur question but something to consider from the FIAs standpoint is the issue of safety if these guys are driving cars with essentially huge blenders on the back', 'It‚Äôs already been done and got subsequently banned by the FIA. See Brabham BT46']",0,39,2024-10-14 06:33:09, Technical,0,0
