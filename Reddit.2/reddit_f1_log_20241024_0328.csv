First, I want to emphasize that the intention of my previous post was not to single out Verstappen negatively. In fact, I respect Verstappen as an exceptional talent who pushes the boundaries of the sport.

So, by request, here's a deep dive into the rules that have been changed or clarified solely because of Lewis Hamilton's actions.

- - -  

**1. Gaining an Advantage Off-Track Clarification**

Race: 2008 Belgian Grand Prix


Incident: Hamilton cut the chicane while battling Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen, allowing him to overtake. He let R√§ikk√∂nen back past but immediately overtook him again at the next corner.

Rule Clarification: The FIA clarified that if a driver gains an advantage by leaving the track, they must not only give back the position but also ensure they do not retain any lasting advantage. Immediate re-overtaking or benefiting from a better position due to going off-track is prohibited. This clarification aimed to ensure fairness in racing duels.

**2. Emphasis on Honesty with Officials**

Race: 2009 Australian Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton and his McLaren team were found to have provided misleading information to the stewards regarding an incident under the safety car involving Jarno Trulli. Initially, Hamilton told the stewards he did not deliberately let Trulli pass, leading to Trulli's penalty. Later, radio transmissions revealed that Hamilton had been instructed to let Trulli pass.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced the requirement for absolute honesty in all communications with the stewards. Providing misleading information resulted in more severe penalties, including disqualification.

**3. Ban on Excessive Weaving to Defend Position**

Race: 2010 Malaysian Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton weaved multiple times on the straight to break the tow from Vitaly Petrov, who was attempting to overtake. This was deemed dangerous and unsportsmanlike.

Rule Change: The FIA expanded the rules on defensive driving, stating that drivers are allowed only one move to defend their position per straight and prohibiting excessive weaving to impede another car. This was introduced to enhance safety and ensure fair competition during overtaking maneuvers.

~~**4. Restrictions on Helmet Design Changes**~~


~~Implemented: 2016 Season~~

~~Incident: Hamilton frequently changed his helmet designs, making it harder for fans, commentators, and officials to identify drivers quickly.~~

~~Rule Change: The FIA introduced a rule starting in 2016 limiting drivers to one helmet design per season, with exceptions for special occasions. This aimed to improve driver recognition.~~

(*Edit: as pointed out by several users, the rule on helmet restrictions was primarily driven by the actions of Sebastian Vettel, rather then Hamilton*)

**5. Reinforcement of Pit Entry and Exit Regulations**

Race: 2018 German Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton aborted a pit stop entry by cutting across the grass to rejoin the track, crossing the pit entry line, which was against the rules.

Rule Clarification: The FIA reinforced existing rules prohibiting crossing the pit entry and exit lines, emphasizing safety concerns. Drivers must commit to the pit entry once they cross the commitment line and cannot rejoin the track. This clarification ensured consistent enforcement of pit lane regulations.

**6. Podium Attire Regulations and Political Messaging**

Race: 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton wore a T-shirt on the podium that read ""Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor,"" highlighting social justice issues.

Rule Change: The FIA updated podium and pre-race regulations to prohibit drivers from wearing clothing with political or personal statements during official activities. Drivers must wear their race suits fully zipped up during podium ceremonies and official interviews. The aim was to maintain political neutrality during official events.

**7. Jewelry Ban Enforcement**

Race: 2022 Miami Grand Prix

Incident: Hamilton wore jewelry, including piercings and necklaces, while driving, despite existing regulations prohibiting jewelry for safety reasons.

Rule Enforcement: The FIA decided to strictly enforce the existing ban on wearing jewelry during competition, requiring drivers to remove all jewelry before sessions. This emphasized safety concerns, as jewelry can hinder medical procedures or pose additional risks during accidents.
 

**8. External Assistance Rule Change**

(*suggested by /u/EndiKopi*)

Race: 2007 European Grand Prix


Incident: During the race, Lewis Hamilton crashed and required assistance to be lifted back onto the track using a tractor.

Rule Change: Following this incident, the FIA changed the rules regarding external assistance during races. Drivers are prohibited from receiving outside help (such as tractors or other vehicles) to get back onto the track after a crash. Any external assistance provided during a race would result in penalties, emphasizing that drivers must recover on their own or with help from their team within the pit lane.


- - - 

It's interesting to note that despite his 18 years driving in Formula 1 (so far), it looks like only three rule changes or clarifications have been made solely as a result of Lewis Hamilton's driving.

Feel free to discuss or point out any additional rules I might have missed!","['Now do Schumacher üòÇ', ""Wasn't there one in 2007 when Lewis came back to the track with the help of a tractor and then the external help rule had to be clarified?\n\nEdit: European GP 2007"", 'Jewelery ban was dope.. I remember Lewis showing up for a press conference with 4 watches', ""Not saying it had nothing to do with Hamilton but wasn't the helmet one changed mostly because of Vettel?"", 'Number 1 was of note since the clarification was made after the race, then the penalty applied in retrospect.', 'Pretty insane that 1/4 (or could say 3/8) of the rules changed due to lewis are just about his choice of style and clothes. The FIA really does hate to see it', 're: rule 7, i thought a few drivers used to race wearing necklaces and rings, not just hamilton, right? i mean i remember there as a whole debacle because they tried to explicitly ban piercings whilst allowing wedding rings for example. also rule 4 is funny bc nowadays he rarely does special helmets', ""**4. Restrictions on Helmet Design Changes**\n\nI'm pretty sure it was Vettel that prompted this.\n\nHamilton may have added things here and there and occasionally wore special helmets for a given race weekend but fundamentally Hamilton stuck with a fairly consistent design for the season\n\nbut it was Vettel who would show up with a completely new and different helmet design each race weekend making it hard for people to identify the driver."", '>6. Podium Attire Regulations and Political Messaging\n\n>Race: 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix\n\n>Incident: Hamilton wore a T-shirt on the podium that read ""Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor,"" highlighting social justice issues.\n\n>Rule Change: The FIA updated podium and pre-race regulations to prohibit drivers from wearing clothing with political or personal statements during official activities. Drivers must wear their race suits fully zipped up during podium ceremonies and official interviews. The aim was to maintain political neutrality during official events.\n\nInviting a Presidential candidate during the election year however is maintaining neutrality? It\'s funny how certain people can be classified as political or not.']",1901,317,2024-10-24 03:28:06, Discussion,28,0

When I won the championship in 2006 and joined McLaren, I had a three-year contract: 2007, 2008, and 2009. And I was 99% sure that 2009 would be my last season in F1. That was my plan, a very clear plan in my head. I won the championship in 2005 and 2006, signed with McLaren for three years, and that was my last contract in my mind,"" he added.\n\nBut what was the exact reason Fernando Alonso was considering retiring after the 2009 season? The truth is that, once he had achieved his dreams, he thought he would expand his record with the Woking team and then start a new life‚Ä¶ but reality was very different, and the troubles at McLaren were constant in 2007. Fortunately, he changed his mind, and we still have Fernando in F1.\n\n""I don‚Äôt know. Maybe there wasn‚Äôt any specific reason for it, but when I signed that contract, it was a three-year deal, and in my head, at that time, it felt like a long-term contract. And okay, three years might seem long, but this would be the last one. I had already fulfilled my dream,"" Fernando added.\n\n""I won the championship twice. This went beyond my wildest dreams, you know, becoming a Formula 1 champion. So, what else was there for me to do here? When I signed this contract with McLaren, I expected to win more races and championships, but after Formula 1, there‚Äôs a different life outside.""\n\n""Beyond racing, I was thinking I‚Äôd have a family and do normal things, live normal days. As for your question, I don‚Äôt think the Fernando of 2001 would have thought anything strange about the 400th Grand Prix, because I wasn‚Äôt thinking much about the future. But in 2007, it would definitely have been a surprise,"" Alonso concluded.', ""I imagine he would've retired had he won with Ferrari as well. Especially 2012 but I guess in part not having had good machinery for the majority of his career is probably what has prolonged it."", ""Even if he won 2007, and then retired in 2009, I feel like he would've been less of an icon than he is now. His career had many ups and downs (mostly downs, unfortunately) but his longevity and passion made him a proper legend of the sport. After his WDC years, his ferrari stint was incredible, the constant fights, hero drives and heartbreaks. No WDC to take away but anyone who was invested in the sport and watched around that time will know just how good he was then. The memes his 2nd mclaren stint spawned are quoted and joked about this day and the exhilarating emotion of seeing him take the fight to the front in the small window that the aston was actually good, was nothing like I experienced in this sport since I've started watching 3 decades ago. He reached over 100 podiums (hell, even took one in the alpine in 2021, it felt absolutely unreal at the time) which I was really doubting would ever happen. \n\n\nTo me, its just insane to think that this guy has been driving long enough that he's able to talk about what it was like to go toe to toe with The Michael, while still actively driving and putting in great results (when the car allows it)."", 'He definitely would have retired sooner if he won with Ferrari in 2010 or 2012.\n\n  \nThat second McLaren stint always felt like a bit of a desperate move.', 'Thank god he didn‚Äôt because we wouldn‚Äôt see his Ferrari stint then', ""Since watching in 1999, 2012 is the only result I'd change.

Compared to other circuits, Mexico is particularly dusty/dirty in FP1 so it's not very representative anyway.\n\n\n\n2. It's a short, simple track, which means it's easier to make up for lost time both in terms of track learning and track time, because you can set more laps on a 1m20s circuit over 60 minutes than a 1m30s or 1m40s circuit.\n\n\n3. FP2 is extended this year so compared to other circuits the main drivers are only missing 30 minutes of total practice time (3hrs vs 2.5hrs)"", ""Not commenting on the question, I think that's a fair one to ask, but I have a counter question: where did you get that list of drivers?\n\nAs far as I can tell, you've got half of them wrong. Sauber is (for some godforsaken reason) not fielding Pourchaire but instead going with Robert Shwartzman, Vesti and Doohan aren't making appearances. However, Drugovich will take over the Aston Martin of Alonso, and you are correct on Bearman, Antonelli and O'Ward.

There's also a Pirelli tire test in FP2, so it's really not an ideal place for a rookie FP1. Regardless, this late in the year, the only options left without sprints are Mexico, Vegas, and Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi will definitely have the most, but teams have to do one for each car, and most don't want to do it the same race- though Red Bull did last year. Last year obviously no one would do Vegas since it was a new track. It's still only the second year of the track, but I'm curious to see if any rookie fp1 will happen. So, Mexico is the best one left.\n\nTeams don't usually want to do them early for a variety of reasons.

In Mexico, there will be a tyres test in FP2. How will it work? Pirelli wrote the following on its website, but it looks a bit difficult to understand. Can someone make it easier to understand the full process? 

>  
The first day of track action, Friday 25 October, will be slightly different to usual. The second free practice session will be entirely given over to validating the softer compounds in Pirelli‚Äôs 2025 range (C4, C5 and C6) in what is known as an in-competition test. The session is extended by 30 minutes to 90 and all drivers and teams will have to follow a specific programme established by the Pirelli engineers. Apart from the dry tyre allocation specifically for the Grand Prix (two sets of Hard, three of Medium and seven of Soft, one less than usual), each driver will have two additional sets of tyres: one will be identical to the one available for the weekend, to act as a *baseline*, while the other will be a 2025 prototype *option,* both in terms of compound and of construction ‚Äì actually the latter already homologated back in September.

>These two sets will not have any sidewall colour bands. The plan is for the programme to include a performance run and a long run for each set, with every team running the same number of laps with the same quantity of fuel on board, dependent on the type of run. The only exception will be in the case of a regular race driver being replaced for FP1 by a young driver. These race drivers will carry out the Pirelli test for 60 minutes of FP2 only and will have an additional set of Medium compound tyres to catch up as much as possible on acquiring data for the rest of the weekend. All the test data will then be analysed by Pirelli engineers to fine tune the characteristics of the compounds prior to the group test in Abu Dhabi, which starts on the Tuesday after the final round of the 2024 championship. It means that teams will have to prepare their cars for qualifying and the race in the space of two hours: FP1 on Friday and FP3 on Saturday.","[""Basically FP2 will be replaced with a tyre test. Pirelli will bring one new type of tyre, intended to replace one of the compounds for next year. For the sake of explanation, let's say they bring the tyres they're planning to use for C2 next year. \n\nEach team will get a set of the current C2 tyres as well as a set of the prototype C2s and will have to do as close to identical runs on each set as possible so Pirelli can compare the behaviour of the prototypes with the existing tyres.\n\nThe only exception is if a driver has missed FP1 because of a rookie. Then they'll get 30 minutes to do whatever their team wants before doing the Pirelli test for the remaining hour."", 'Should really be called Not-Free Practice 2', ""So it seems that the Pirelli test will take all 90 minutes of FP2, each driver will have to do a long run and a short run on a baseline set, which will be a tyre from this year, and then the same on a test set for next year that Pirelli give them. There's a baseline and a test set so that Pirelli can see the difference between this year's tyres and next year's. These run plans are set by Pirelli: numbers of laps, pace, fuel levels etc. to give Pirelli the data they want for the test tyres.\n\nWhen it comes to a driver who is replaced by a young driver in FP1, they'll do a shorter program which will only take 60 minutes, giving them 30 minutes and an extra set of mediums to do some of their usual quali/race prep."", 'Most will go in circles and get changed from time to time', ""I'm guessing this all goes out the window if it rains."", '90 minutes of track action as a lead in to the World Series‚Ä¶Here for it', "">The only exception is if a driver has missed FP1 because of a rookie. Then they'll get 30 minutes to do whatever their team wants **before** doing the Pirelli test for the remaining hour.\n\nafter. This has been changed since last year. And although they could do whatever they like on paper, everyone must return a previously unused set of Mediums after FP2. So they are basically sure to use only those."", 'Thanks a lot. So they will know which tyre they are testing or not?', 'The FPs have always just been Friday Practice to me.\n\n*What about FP3?*\n\nDoes anyone watch FP3']",8,18,2024-10-24 03:28:25, Discussion,-2,0

No new PU because of the cost cap, it\'d only improve lap times ""fractionally"" but has big impact financially so the trade is not worth it (info: remember his current PU is fresh having done the Baku race, Singapore weekend and up to Saturday, FP1, Sprint Quali and Race, and only Q1 in Quali).\n\n\n- Q: Why the difference in performance between Sprint Quali and the rest of the weekend?\n\n\nA: Allison\'s guess is that they ran the cars a bit too low, which improve lap times but also makes the car more unstable and sensitive to bumps and cross-winds if you push your luck too much, which they did.\n\n\n- Q: What was Lewis\' suspension issue and was it fixed for the race?\n\n\nA: A bearing holding a wishbone in the front suspension had started to break-up, leading to rear looseness and instability. It was fully fixed for qualifying and the race.\n\n\n- Q: Why did George have to start from the pit lane?\xa0\n\n\nA: After his crash they had to work on the car outside the authorized hours, triggering an automatic start from the pits.\n\n\n- Q: Did the car have the pace to finish on the podium?\n\n\nA: Allison\'s opinion is no, although they had similar pace to McLaren and Verstappen, P6 was the best the car could get, they\'d have just finished closer to the front pack.\n\n\n- Q: Did the upgrades deliver and what were the problems?\n\n\nA: Yes, the expected downforce was there. The data didn\'t show any issues prior to any of the spins. Less time to dial in with one practice session and the spins in FP, George\'s crash and Lewis\' spin on Sunday.\nThey are still excited about the new package and the issues were most likely down to running the car too low, too stiff, compromising the handling beyond what was acceptable.', 'We have Lewis and George at home\n\nLewis and George at home:', 'oh my God I snorted hahahha']",2,4,2024-10-24 03:28:25, Video,-1,0
