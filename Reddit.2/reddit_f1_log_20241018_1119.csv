Even before this weekend's US Grand Prix in Austin (Texas), the driver question for next year is still unresolved. Even Valtteri Bottas, who is actually considered a hot candidate, seems to be increasingly preoccupied with this - and above all unsettled!\n\nValtteri Bottas is waiting for the decision from Sauber/Audi\n\n‚ÄòI had said that I hoped everything would be sorted out by Austin, but I'm still waiting for the final decisions,‚Äô said Bottas, who apparently can't explain why he doesn't yet have a contract for next year in his pocket. ‚ÄòI think Mattia \\[Binotto, team principal\\] should answer that question rather than me.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòIt's out of my hands,‚Äô says the Finn, who ‚Äúcan't do anything at the moment‚Äù except wait and see. ‚ÄòOf course, I'm trying to do my best this week and hope that lifts the mood.

I think the conditions we are talking about are as they should be and I think Audi should have the budget, at least that's what they say. So I don't think that should be a problem.‚Äô\n\nAfter all, he has ‚Äòalready built up a good relationship with Mattia‚Äô and talked about both his future and the plans for 2025. ‚ÄòI've been told everything so far,‚Äô reveals the current Sauber driver, who also knows that Sauber/Audi has other options for 2025.\n\n‚ÄòI love Formula 1 and I want to drive in Formula 1.

I just have to trust that he knows what he's getting from me.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòI feel and believe that I should have this cockpit and that it's the best thing for the team,‚Äô says Bottas optimistically ahead of the Grand Prix in Austin.

This includes a reorganisation of the way the regulations are laid out, which will be divided into thematic sections for clarity and consistency. The transition to the new structure will be concluded in the next few months.\n \n>The 2026 Technical Regulations (Section C), originally approved in June 2024, were subject to extensive enhancements to the aerodynamic regulations, which have been the subject of a strong collaboration between the FIA, FOM and the Formula 1 teams. This will see a higher performance from the cars, while maintaining management of the wake characteristics to promote close and exciting racing.\n \n>The 2026 Sporting Regulations (Section B) have undergone a significant update in order to simplify and modernise their structure. They have introduced measures to regulate the energy management of the Power Units as well as the management of the adjustable aerodynamics, which will involve the deployment of the ‚Äústraight-line mode‚Äù (low drag) and the ‚Äúcornering mode‚Äù (high downforce). In addition, there will be three pre-season tests of three days each for the 2026 season to account for the new power units that will be adopted.\n \n>The 2026 Financial Regulations (Section D) have built on the experience gained by the FIA, Formula 1 and the teams since the first introduction of Financial Regulations in 2021. Significant effort has been made to simplify the regulations by changes in the perimeter of exclusions and adjustment methodologies and to strengthen measures available to FIA to monitor compliance to the Financial Regulations. The overall level of the cost cap has remained ‚Äì in effect ‚Äì equivalent to the current levels, while the changes to the actual number reflect the changes to exclusion and adjustment perimeter and the effect of cumulative inflation.\n \n> Further elements will be submitted to the World Council for approval in the coming months to complete the regulation package for 2026, while refinements to the already approved sections will continue with the collaboration between the FIA, FOM and the Formula 1 teams.\n\n>**Regulatory updates**          \n>**FIA Formula One World Championship**\n \n>Minor changes for 2024 and 2025 Sporting and Technical regulations were approved by the World Council, including the removal of the point awarded for setting the fastest lap and the increase in requirement for fielding a young driver during free practice from once per season to two times per season.', 'Doesn‚Äôt this say that teams will have to do four rookie practice sessions next year, not remove the requirement completely like people were reporting earlier?', ""It looks like somebody messed up when they tweeted about the rookie sessions.

I pulled a few different regulatory eras and tried to look at the third year of relatively stable rules, like we have now (except 2012, when I just went for the competitive 4th season).

I looked at number of winning cars and drivers, gap between the top 3 in the WDC (percentage of leaders points P3 has) and the gap between the entire field in qualifying. (I excluded any obviously erroneous results such as vastly different weather between Q1 and Q3 or cars multiple seconds away from the pack). **All data was taken for first 16 races only to make it measurable between seasons.**

|Era/Year|# Winning Teams|#Winning Drivers|Gap Between Top 3|Gap Between 1st and last Quali|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Ground Effect - 2024|4|7|72%|2.45s|
|V6 Turbo - 2016|2|4|71%|4.68s|
|KERS - 2012|4|7|78%|6.14s|
|3l V10 - 2002|3|4|35%|4.94s|
|No Driver Aids - 1996|3|4|61%|6.57s|
|Ground Effect Ban - 1986|4|5|96%|10.56s|

This season looks to be up there on all metrics apart from gap between the top 3 in the table at this stage of the season.

But what is staggering is how tight the whole field is compared to any other era, I saw some people calling Sauber ""a joke"" in another thread and this proves just how good of a job Sauber are doing compared to backmarkers of yore. The gap between P20 and P1 in Bahrain this year would have put you 6th on the grid in 1986's opener.","[""Sauber being a joke is definitely relative. They're a joke because week after week, even though their qualifying time is less than 2 seconds.

But now when every car can pull something off and are only really separated by consistency of race pace. \n\nSauber still can't manage to score a single point."", ""I'd love to see F1 with Stable rules, and have the drivers race around the track on horseback"", ""But that isn't being a joke.\n\nThat is being worst of a historically very strong field (probably the strongest of all time).\n\nThey are far from a joke."", 'Charles would fall off immediately.  üòÇüòÇ', ""Sauber always finding itself in the back half of the grid in an era where finishing exactly in the middle gets you a point is of course concerning. But the fact that they're able to finish races and don't trigger the 107% rule on their own makes them a step up compared to the backmarkers of yore."", 'I don\'t know. Sure. If you look at performance on lap time or race time, Sauber is undeniably better than say Minardi, or Caterham, or Super Aguri.\n\nBut let\'s take it to an example (that I know about sorry if it loses you) in competitive Smash Brothers tournaments. What\'s a worse fate. Going to a super major (an event where the best players in the world attend) and coming dead last. Where at least you can say ""well, I never had a chance anyway, these are the best players in the world after all"" \n\nOr going to a local (where the competition is much lower and in line with your average joe) And still coming dead last.\n\n(yes, I know right now 3 of the best drivers possibly of all time are competing but they\'re teams are undeniably held back by regulations and cost caps)', ""But that analogy doesn't work. Your analogy compares modern F1 to a local championship. The level is undeniably higher than previous eras in terms of teams.\n\nThere is no way you could watch F1 in the 80s/90s and tell me the level of the sport was higher than now. \n\nThey are both going to Super Majors, but the older teams are getting wiped out in seconds without landing a hit and Sauber are lasting a few rounds and landing a few hits without getting any wins."", ""I'm more arguing that the teams are being held back so much and Sauber is still comfortably last.\n\nJust remember, Haas is spending more now than they did in 2019.

They give a point for fastest lap, which is often won in rather shambolic circumstances.

In my opinion, if the race winner gets 25 points then pole position should get around 5-10 points, the actual number could be up for debate.

I also think it should just be pole position that gets
Points for qualifying.

Thoughts?","['Pole position should get 5-10 points? Good god.', 'No, pole is already such an advantage in terms of point potential, it needs no further reward.', 'Likely because it would be the same ~3 cars getting the points over and over. Some teams would never be able to get these points, whereas the fastest lap could mean a lot to a team that gets 10th place every so often. \n\nThis would just widen the gap between the big teams and the smaller ones.

Much more fine than with fastest lap- which is allegedly going away next year. But I wouldn‚Äôt support it being worth more than 1-3 points.

What if, for exemple, Verstappen (1st) and Norris (2nd) went to the final round with 8 points between then. 

Fast foward to the three last laps, and Norris is winning with the fastest lap (26 points), while Verstappen is second (17 points) and Perez third.

Up until that moment, Norris would win by one point.

Then, Red Bull call Perez in to get fresh rubber. The mexican fall off the Top 5 (hell, if there was a Safety Car during the race, he could even get out of the Top 10).

And then, on the last lap, while everybody thought that Norris won, Perez set the Fastest Lap, take away Lando's extra point and Verstappen wins the championship in a tie-breaker 'cause he had more wins.

Even if McLaren noticed it, what would they do? If Norris is within 20s of Verstappen, they wouldn't pit him. They only thing they could do, more thay praying, is to send out Piastri to block Perez.
