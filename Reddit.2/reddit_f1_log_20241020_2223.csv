*But* that penalty was inconsistent to what we’ve seen recently - most notably t1 with Norris and Verstappen. So, for the purpose of this post let’s ignore Russel’s penalty as that’s another whole discussion.  

If the rules for the most part are that you can get away with that then why is that the case?
You can just go into a corner and escort your opponent wide? What’s with that? - we will never see any interesting racing.

Especially when the driver that’s been pushed off can’t even fight back because they’ll get a penalty for “keeping the position by going off track” when they had nowhere else to go. 

If it were up to me you’d have to leave a cars width to the car on the outside, when overtaking and defending, as is the rules in most other respects of motorsport afaik. 

Am I alone in thinking this?

Apparently there is a more recent version but not publicly available. Key point is 


Guidelines for overtaking on the outside of a corner:


- In order for a car being overtaken to be required to give sufficient room to an overtaking car, the
overtaking car needs to have a significant portion of the car alongside the car being overtaken and
the overtaking manoeuvre must be done in a safe and controlled manner, while enabling the car to
clearly remain within the limits of the track.

- When considering what is a ‘significant portion’, for an overtaking on the outside of a corner, among
the various factors that will be looked at by the stewards when exercising their discretion, the
stewards will consider if the overtaking car is ahead of the other car from the apex of the corner.

- The car being overtaken must be capable of making the corner while remaining within the limits of
the track.


So Lando wasn't ahead at the apex hence wasn't entitled to room. However, the last point says that Max must be capable of making the corner as well. So IMO they are both in the wrong (or call it a racing incident). Thoughts?

As for overtaking on the outside of a corner, the guidelines acknowledge that it is a more difficult move to pull off.

For a long time drivers have been taught from karting all the way through the racing pyramid that if you try to hang it round the outside, you are at risk of running out of road.

It’s often been left up to how hard certain drivers race. ‘Fairer’ drivers will leave a bit of room for their rivals, more ruthless drivers will edge them out.

But in recent years there has been a clear effort to define when it’s essential for a driver to leave space, and that’s the case in the new guidelines as well.

So, for a driver to be given room when overtaking on the outside, including at the exit of the corner, the overtaking car must:

-Have the front axle AT LEAST ALONGSIDE the front axle of the other car at the apex of the corner AND to the exit
-Be driven in a safe and controlled manner throughout the manoeuvre (entry, apex and exit)
-Be able to make the corner within the track limits

In a lot of cases this is going to leave a driver at the mercy of their rival or the laws of physics as cars on the inside wash out.

This isn’t intended to stop an optimistic pass, it just means drivers have to accept the risks involved. It is quite close to being a codified ‘live by the sword, die by the sword’ rule.
