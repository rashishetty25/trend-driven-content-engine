1g7ltgt,Much Needed Context Behind the Alonso and Lawson Squabble,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7ltgt/much_needed_context_behind_the_alonso_and_lawson/,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g7ltgt/much_needed_context_behind_the_alonso_and_lawson/,2024-10-19,0 days,"So I looked at the onboards of lap 1. Lawson was overly aggressive with his racecraft on lap 1. Let me do a walk through:


On T11 of lap 1, he divebombed, and punted Alonso fully off the track. On that same straight, he weaved around the straight when Alonso came back at him, and Alonso had to take avoiding action.



In lap 5, Lawson was also moving under braking on turn 11. Later that lap, he closed the door on him in turn 18.


Then when you look at THE incident, Liam, again, moved pretty late on the straight to the point that alonso had to lift. The big issue there is that their scrapping meant that ocon got past. 


Alonso’s reaction is from a culmination of the incidents prior to the one where Ocon got past. I’m surprised that everybody jumped to the Alonso bullying narrative instead of posting the onboards of lap 1 and 5, that showed that Liam was too aggressive. ","[""Last year, Lawson was actually like that when he was in Super Formula, so I'm not surprised.  \nHe achieved good results with his “I'm not going to stay here long, so I don't care if you guys don't like me” approach.  \nWell, anyway, he is a tougher racer than most people think.\n\nEDIT: For clarification  \nThe quotation marks do not mean what he said, but that I felt that way about his approach.  \n(Sorry if anyone misunderstood.)"", 'Where is the video son? We need the video', 'Still, I don\'t understand how thats bad for Lawson\'s career (""It\'s his career down the line"") or being stupid given he only has 6 races. \n\nIf it proves he can be aggressive when needed, and if he end up even 1 place higher than otherwise, then the team will not complain. If anything it proves he is able to take measured risks.  Might not be to Alonso\'s liking, but making it be that he was driving stupidly is just not it.\n\nIf he had been penalized I would agree. But he wasn\'t.', 'Take your well informed analysis away from here, we don’t need it', "">I’m surprised that everybody jumped to the Alonso bullying narrative\xa0\n\nShouldn't be surprised, based on Nando's history. I wouldn't call it bullying, I'd just say he goes a bit overtop about other drivers even when he's out of the car. In the car with adrenaline pumping is understandable, they all do it. But to talk to the media about a rookie like that? It's just unbecoming. \n\nAnd then apparently Fernando told Liam he was gonna do something about it during quali? Sheesh."", 'I stopped reading at the ""out of line"". Much needed context? It\'s motor racing, bro.', ""This is not context at all lmao this is just your opinion!\n\nLap 1 T11 is not a divebomb, Alonso leaves the door wide open hoping to cut back to the apex for a better exit and Lawson takes the opportunity. Whether or not he needs to leave him room I'm not sure, but from the onboard there's a chance he's ahead at the apex and doesn't need to, from Ocon's camera it looks like Lawson is ahead. Doesn't look like he weaves on the straight, he moves left at the same time as Alonso, it's just unfortunate that they both went left at the same time, it happens sometimes. Once Alonso has committed to the inside he goes back to the racing line which is fine. Lawson is ahead at the apex and doesn't need to leave any space.\n\nLawson isn't moving under braking lap 5, T11, just showing his hand to Alonso and then moves back to the racing line, braking in a straight line, just cause he doesn't brake parallel to the edge of the track doesn't mean it's moving under braking; Alonso's not in a reasonable position to make a move so it doesn't really matter, nor is he trying to. Lawson is allowed to close the door on him on the exit of 18, he's ahead the whole way round that corner.\n\n'THE incident' Lawson starts moving left before Alonso, Alonso doesn't judge the closing speed well enough and has to get out of it. Lawson moves back to the racing line and leaves Alonso the inside, which he's allowed to do once Alonso has committed to the inside. Alonso goes deep and Lawson gets a pretty good exit towards 13, he's way ahead entering 13 and closes the door, no problems there. Alonso again goes deep due to entering on a shallow line, Ocon goes for a better exit and gets the position.\n\nI know you want your driver to do well, we all do, but if you're going to make a post like this, and don't know the rules, at least position it as your opinion, not objective fact."", 'its not that serious.

McLaren told Lando as early as lap 5, basically 25% into the sprint that Max's tyres were degrading too fast and also on lap 6.

This was obviously wrong information which may have inspired Lando to push more than he should to try and chase Max instead of focussing on keeping the fast Ferraris behind.

McLaren seem to lack the pace this weekend. They should have done what Max did in Singapore. Recognise early that their rival has superior pace and focus on consolidating P2.
