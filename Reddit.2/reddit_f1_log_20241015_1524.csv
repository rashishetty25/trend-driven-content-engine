I’ll be marshaling at turn 18, right under the tower at the USGP this weekend. 

I’m planning to make the Ferrari boys each their own authentic Texas felt cowboy hat. I’ll be branding them with a Scud. Ferrari emblem on the front, and their respective name/number on the brim. 

The problem is, cowboy hats are extremely finicky when it comes to sizing. I have scraped the internet to no avail, so this is my last resort: does anybody know where I can get a general idea of head dimensions/hat size/anything for Charles/Carlos? My go to guess will be medium ish for Charles (size 7 - 7 1/8) and large ish for Carlos (size 7 1/4 ish) 

Appreciate any help! If you’ll be at COTA, say hi to your friendly neighborhood marshal wearing a straw lid at T18


Edit: I have emailed/DMed SF directly, as well as Carlos and Charles talent managements. No response :( 

Edit 2: everyone saying not to give gifts, idk I think an authentic lid with the Ferrari logo burned into it would be fitting for at least PR reasons. Who knows, if one of them wins, maybe they’ll take it to the podium. Worst case it’s $100 burned and a few hours of my time ","['I’ll be brutally honest, save your money.

Plus it is super long and exhausting days with barely any time for funsies. Make some for yourself and your friends!!', 'Nice try Mr. Sniper', 'Save your time and money brother', ""There not taking it to the podium as they won't be allowed. They have to wear their regulation gear.\n\nPlease save your money you need it more than they do and as much as Liberty like to hype up races as if the world has stopped just for F1.. it is just another day of work in an over packed schedule for all these drivers and teams who will be focused on nothing but their obligations."", 'On the podium I think they must wear the Pirelli sponsored hats :) Hope you figure it out, and have a good weekend!', ""Save your money. They're already contractual obliged to wear specific items of clothing. If they have some wiggle room in their contract, they're likely to fill it with brands they're personally associated with. Wearing anything else is likely to upset sponsors who pay big bucks to be seen being worn by drivers"", ""I do have one point of info for you, stemming from a series of helmet exchanges Seb did. When Seb swapped with George, they tried on each other's helmets, and George couldn't fit Seb's on, and it came out that Seb wore a size small helmet, and George wore size 'large at least' I think was the line. You can find the video. Well, I found a separate picture from Charles's and Seb's helmet exchange, and they could each fit in the other's helmet. It looked like maybe Charles had to shove it on a bit harder, but he did fit fine, unlike George. So... I think your assessment of Charles having smaller to mediumish head for an adult man is accurate. One more tiny data point, Lewis also managed to shove Seb's helmet on. Maybe about like Charles could. So I don't think Seb has like a tiny head, just small, and Charles and Lewis might wear one size up- or maybe two, I don't know how many sizes there are and how much wiggle room there is with helmet padding, though I believe it is pretty stiff padding.\n\nReference points for Carlos. He did a helmet exchange with Lando, and Carlos's helmet didn't get remotely close to going over Lando's head. Like not even to eye level like Seb's helmet went on George. That helmet just wasn't going anywhere, and Carlos did try shoving it, haha. When Lando exchanged with Daniel, Lando managed to shove the helmet on. Daniel clearly had a much easier time getting on Lando's helmet, he showed the wiggle room, but the helmet did fit fully on Lando's head, unlike Carlos's. So... this is not that much of a reference point for Carlos, since I don't have a connection to any sort of resembling concrete size... but I would guess that Carlos has a smallish to mediumish head for an adult man and that if you are estimating large for him, that might be wrong. Unless Lando just has a really, really massive head, and Daniel has a quite large one.\n\nI do agree with others who say you should save your money and are unlikely to reach them. I do agree that reaching out to trainers like I see you've done is your best chance. I do know that both of them like gifts from fans. Charles wears bracelets from fans, but something as large as a cowboy hat has travel logistics. You can always make them for yourself and a friend, and if you happen to have the opportunity to pass them off, go for it? I realize you might not have a similar size head to our best guesses for them."", ""A rule I have in life is don't give people gifts if they earn more than double what I do.""]",169,60,2024-10-15 15:24:46, Discussion,3,0

Before we get started, if you missed last week’s issue [you can catch up here.](https://open.substack.com/pub/lastweekinformula1/p/last-week-in-formula-1-september?r=4apk87&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)

If you’re a rookie ‘round these parts and wondering what you're in for, *Last Week in Formula 1* is a weekly newsletter compiling the most interesting, important, and informative goings-on in the Formula 1 world.

Every fun fact, story, and piece of news has been sourced from posts in r/formula1 (AKA: Formula 1’s publicly accessible online paddock).

Given this is The Internet, take everything you read with a grain of salt. However, after over three years of following the subreddit, there’s far more truth than lies posted—and much of the news comes from reputable sources.

On a semi-related note, like the cars we enjoy watching so much, *Last Week in Formula 1* is in a constant state of development. Any feedback you have on what’s covered, the format, or anything I missed is welcome in the comments.

And if you, like me, enjoy pretty things…

# Results & Stats from the Track

Behold, [the most common podium pairs from this season…](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fznbuk/most_common_podium_pairs_this_season/)

Also behold, [this season’s front row start stats…](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0c0e2/front_row_starts_2024/)

You’ll find a familiar ~~face~~ team dominating [2024’s top 10 fastest pit stops…](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0s56w/fastest_pitstops_in_2024_so_far/)

And that’s a wrap on this section! Don’t blame me for the dull week… I don’t make the news or write all these posts, I just compile and report!

\~\~\~

# The Drivers’ Mutterings & Mumblings

*In the absence of any meaningful rumblings and rumours this week…* 

[Alex Albono says he welcomes the challenge of Carlos Sainz at Williams next year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fyw937/formula_1_alex_albon_says_he_will_welcome_carlos/) To be fair though, what else was he going to say? Naturally, [Williams are also backing Mr. Albono to match Señor Sainz behind the wheel in 2025.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0lfk7/williams_backs_brilliant_alex_albon_to_match/)

And at long last…

2022 F2 Champion-turned-Aston Martin Test & Reserve Driver [Felipe Drugovich will drive the AMR24 during FP1 in Mexico](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fzrscx/aston_martin_test_and_reserve_driver_felipe/)—his first ever outing in the car he’s been extensively involved in the development of. I must say, I do hope he gets a chance to show his stuff during an F1 race one day.

For a dose of current F2 driver news, former Red Bull Junior and 2021 rookie F3 Champion [Dennis Hauger rejected an offer from an unnamed F2 team (for what would be his fourth season in the series) to try his luck in Indy NXT](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g2anhv/otviaplay_motor_pod_dennis_hauger_has_rejected_an/) (the feeder series for IndyCar) in 2025. May the downforce be with you in ‘Murica!

\~\~\~

# The Teams’ Twistings & Turnings

There were whispers about this ‘lil diddy around Suzuka time, which faded almost as soon as the paddock left the track. So while this came out of the blue amidst Summer Break #2, [Haas entering a technical partnership with Toyota Gazoo Racing](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g16kv4/haas_f1_team_sporting_a_new_look_on_the_vf24_we/) isn’t a complete surprise—and *is* a big deal. Haas sure has come a long, long way from getting left high and dry by Rich Energy.

While [Toyota has insisted (repeatedly) that their union with Haas isn’t part of a grander plan to fire up an engine program](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g13obv/racefans_toyota_has_stated_clearly_it_has_no_plan/) or return to F1 as works team, that’s not stopping—and won’t—the rumblings and rumours to the contrary.

*This entry comes with a “slightly off-topic” label:* Michael Andretti, son of Mario (one of only three drivers *ever* to win races in Formula 1, IndyCar, the World Sportscar Championship, and NASCAR), [has stepped down from his day-to-day operations role at Andretti Global.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fyd8zq/ot_an_open_letter_from_michael_andretti_andretti/) While he claims the reason his to spend more time with his family, one can’t help but wonder if the so-far-failed attempt at entering F1 he spearheaded is part of the puzzle.

Relatedly, [General Motors hasn’t abandoned joining the grid with their Cadillac brand, and are apparently in charge of the negotiations with F1 now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0jsd1/general_motors_has_not_abandoned_the_idea_of/) 

So… Has the end of Andretti’s hopes and dreams for joining F1 officially come to pass? Who bloody knows, because allegedly [Andretti will have their first 2026 chassis ready before Christmas this year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0da71/exclusive_andretti_will_have_first_2026_f1/) Believe what you wish, I say!

For a quick, final hit of hardly surprising team news, [Williams have held their hands up and said they’ll compromise their 2025 season](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0144d/formula_1_announces_new_multiyear_partnership/) in favour of pouring additional resource into the new 2026 regulations and engine formula. Yeah, you and the rest of the grid… Relatedly, Carlos Sainz Sr. has spilled his beans on [why Young Carlos rejected Audi in favour of Williams.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fzu17g/williams_is_a_project_thats_going_up_carlos/)

# Technical Tidbits

Formula 1 Tire Godking Pirelli will [bring a slew of 2025 soft tire prototypes—including a new C6 compound—to Mexico for testing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fyyggs/tobi_gr%C3%BCner_pirelli_will_bring_2025_prototype/) They also went testing at Mugello with Ferrari this week, [as shown in these pretty pics.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0e698/another_tyre_test_for_ferrari_with_pirelli_at/)

After rumblings and rumours about the new 2026 cars gestating into hot piles of trash that can’t overtake and will have to slow down on the straights in order to recharge their batteries, Aston Martin TP Mike Krack claims that [F1 is/will be in a much better place in 2026 after agreeing to increase the cars’ downforce.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0ca7x/f1_in_a_much_better_place_after_agreeing_to/) Downforce ain’t everything though race fans… Only time will tell!

# Playtime in the Paddock

The (two week long) trend of motorsport personalities doing Reddit AMAs continues with our beloved Martin Brundle—[because he can, and he did.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fzu1mt/hi_im_martin_brundle_former_f1_racing_driver_and/)

Here’s the [juicy ex-Alpine Team Principle Otmar Szafnauer tell-all interview on his abrupt firing and the Piasco](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fy0mud/otmar_szafnauer_exclusive_the_truth_behind_my/) (that you’ve surely been waiting months for).

Redditor of 4.5K (and growing) new karmic wealth, u/Aggressive_Fee6507, [took his lion out for a walk in London, enabling him to run into everyone’s favourite FIA-branded punching bag, Mohammed Ben Sulayem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g2w56d/just_out_for_a_stroll/)

Everyone’s favourite swear bear Guenther Steiner dished out an interview this week with the New York Times, sharing that [he’s savouring post-F1 Team Principle life and “doesn’t need Gene Haas anymore.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g25vrq/guenther_steiner_savors_postf1_team_boss_life_i/) Byegene!

F1’s favourite rookie, Fernando Alonso spilled the beans on—and I loosely quote—[the past, the present, the future, engaging a new generation of fans, giving back to the sport he loves so dearly, and his long-awaited 33rd win.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g21n21/undercut_fernando_alonso_forever_young_fernando/)

Never seen an F1 car up close and personal? Wanna get a good idea of how big their tires are? [Using this banana plushie for scale](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fyd575/some_tyres_at_singapore_gp_last_year_with_banana/) should surely help.

Biased (yet insightful) as he may be, Ferrari’s driver coach Jock Clear addressed [why he believes Charles has got the ‘stuff’ to become WDC.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fy6eak/jock_clear_charles_driver_coach_absolutely/)

Amidst the dog days of Summer Break #2, the fine folks at the Mercedes factory in [Brackley have been keeping busy by rehoming their (now formerly) resident lizards.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fz3hgn/mercedes_f1_team_rehomes_lizards_found_at/) Somewhere in the jungle, Danica Patrick is screeching…

Following in their few weeks old footsteps of announcing [their long-term partnership with Lego,](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fjsy23/formula_1_were_putting_play_in_pole_position/) F1 has continued their impressive quest for commercial domination by [joining forces with Hot Wheels.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1g0144d/formula_1_announces_new_multiyear_partnership/) Don’t get your hopes up for finding these cars in grocery store bargain bins though.

*To close with a 100% off-topic-but-interesting-nonetheless entry…*

~~Neo from The Matrix~~ F1 fan [Keanu Reeves made his racing debut in the Toyota GR Cup series last weekend.](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1fxk2df/actor_keanu_reeves_spins_car_finishes_25th_in/) He qualified 31st out of 35 cars, then impressively climbed through the pack to 21st before spinning and finishing 25th.

I'm not saying that's necessarily *the* characteristic of the great drivers, just that some have it and others don't.

Of the recent ones, I would say Schumacher, Alonso and arguably Verstappen have this attitude. They don't do this all the time, but when necessary they do it, and seem reasonably OK with the choice. 

Hamilton, Rosberg and Vettel are capable of this, and have crashed into other people deliberately (or deliberately effected a crash, if you like), but I get the sense that these were out of frustration or anger; they were never in ""control"" of the situation.

My question is: who was the last British champion driver who had that kind of ruthlessness about him? 

I don't think Button had it, nor Hill (despite that threat during Spa '98). Maybe Mansell, but I'm slightly too young to have watched him live, and my abiding image of him is pushing very hard during a race and having his car breakdown one way or another. 

Again, I don't think this is necessarily a desirable quality in a driver, nor does it mean a driver who has it is better or worse than others.","['Heres a surprise.
